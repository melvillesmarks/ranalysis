      Two Gentlemen of Verona (V. 1 pp. 79-152)
      
      How
      young
      Leander
      crossed
      the
      Hellespont.
   
      
      like
      a
      male-content;
  
  
      to
      relish
      a
      love-song,
  
  
      like
      a
      robin-
      red-breast;
  
  
      
         to
         walk
         alone,
         like
         one
         that
         had
         the
         pestilence
  
  
      
   
      
         to
         walk
         alone,
         like

         had
         the
         pestilence
  
  
      
      
      not
      welcome.
      I
      reckon
      this
      alwaysâ€”
      that
      a
      man
      is
      never
      undone,
      till
      he
      be
      hanged;
      nor
      never
      welcome
      to
      a
      place,
      till
      some
      certain
      shot
      be
      paid,
      and
      the
   
      
      I
      to
      myself
      am
      dearer
      than
      a
      friend;
   
      
      Lest
      it
      should
      burn
      above
      the
      bounds
      of
      reason.
      Jul.
      The
      more
      thou
      dam'st
      it
      up,
      the
      more
      it
      burns;
      The
      current,
      that
      with
      gentle
      murmur
      glides,
      Thou
      know'st,
      being
      stopped,
      impatiently
      doth
      rage;
      But,
      when
      his
      fair
      course
      is
      not
      hindered,
      He
      makes
      sweet
      music
      with
      th'
      enameled
      stones,
      Giving
      a
      gentle
      kiss
      to
      every
      sedge
      He
      overtaketh
      in
      his
      pilgrimage;
      And
      so
      by
      many
      winding
      nooks
      he
      strays,
      With
      willing
      sport
      to
      the
      wild
      ocean.
      Then
      let
      me
      go,
      and
      hinder
      not
      my
      course:
      I'll
      be
      as
      patient
      as
      a
      gentle
      stream,
      And
      make
      a
      pastime
      of
      each
      weary
      step,
      Till
      the
      last
      step
      have
      brought
      me
      to
      my
      love;
      
         And
         there
         I'll
         rest,
         as,
         after
         much
         turmoil,
         A
         blessed
         soul
         doth
         in
         Elysium.
      
   
      
         And
         there
         I'll

      Two Gentlemen of Verona (V. 1 pp. 79-152)
      
      How
      young
      Leander
      crossed
      the
      Hellespont.
   
      
      like
      a
      male-content;
  
  
      to
      relish
      a
      love-song,
  
  
      like
      a
      robin-
      red-breast;
  
  
      
         to
         walk
         alone,
         like
         one
         that
         had
         the
         pestilence
  
  
      
   
      
         to
         walk
         alone,
         like
         one
         that
         had
         the
         pestilence
  
  
      
      
      not
      welcome.
      I
      reckon
      this
      alwaysâ€”
      that
      a
      man
      is
      never
      undone,
      till
      he
      be
      hanged;
      nor
      never
      welcome
      to
      a
      place,
      till
      some
      certain
      shot
      be
      paid,
      and
      the
   
      
      I
      to
      myself
      am
      dearer
      than
      a
      friend;
   
      
      Lest
      it
      should
      burn
      above
      the
      bounds
      of
      reason.
      Jul.
      The
      more
      thou
      dam'st
      it
      up,
      the
      more
      it
      burns;
      The
      current,
      that
      with
      gentle
      murmur
      glides,
      Thou
      know'st,
      being
      stopped,
      impatiently
      doth
      rage;
      But,
      when
      his
      fair
      course
      is
      not
      hindered,
      He
      makes
      sweet
      music
      with
      th'
      enameled
      stones,
      Giving
      a
      gentle
      kiss
      to
      every
      sedge
      He
      overtaketh
      in
      his
      pilgrimage;
      And
      so
      by
      many
      winding
      nooks
      he
      strays,
      With
      willing
      sport
      to
      the
      wild
      ocean.
      Then
      let
      me
      go,
      and
      hinder
      not
      my
      course:
      I'll
      be
      as
      patient
      as
      a
      gentle
      stream,
      And
      make
      a

      step,
      Till

      brought
      me
      to

      love;
      
         And
         there
         I'll
         rest,
         as,
         after
         much
         turmoil,

      and
      taste
      with
      a
      distempered
      appetite.
      To
      be
      generous,
      guiltless
      and
      of
      free
      disposition,
      is
      to
      take
      those
      things
      for
      bird-bolts,
      that
      you
      deem

      There
      is
      no
      slander

      our

      the

      O

      O,

      and
      hear;

      coming,
      That
      can
      sing
      both
      high
      and
      low:
      Trip
      no
      farther,
      pretty
      sweeting;
      Journeys
      end
      in
      lovers'
      meeting,
      Every
      wise
      man's

      Clo.
      What
      is
      love?
      'tis
      not

      Present

      present
      laughter;
      What's
      to
      come
      is
      still
      unsure:
      In
      delay
      there
      lies
      no
      plenty;
      Then
      come

      me,
      sweet-and-twenty,
      Youth's
      a
      stuff
      will
      not
      endure.
   
      
      than
      a
      steward?
      Dost
      thou
      think,
      because
      thou
      art
      virtuous,
      there
      shall
      be
      no
      more
      cakes
      and
      ale?
   
      
      since
      the
      youth

      to-day
      with

      What,
      for
      being
      a
      Puritan?
      thy
      exquisite
   
      
      too
      late
      to
      go
      to
      bed
      now:
   
      
      An
      elder
      than
      herself;
      so
      wears
      she
      to
      him,
      So
      sways
      she
      level
      in
      her
      husband's
      heart.
      For,
      boy,
      however
      we
      do
      praise
      ourselves,
      Our
      fancies
      are
      more
      giddy
      and
      unfirm,
      More
      longing,
      wavering,
      sooner
      lost
      and
      worn
   
      
      The
      spinsters
      and
      the
      knitters
      in
      the
      sun,
      And
      the
      free
      maids
      that
      weave
      their
      thread
      with
      bones,
      Do
      use
      to
      chant
      it;
      it
      is
      silly

      And
      dallies

      the

      of

      There

      O,
      peace!
      now
      he's
      deeply
      in;
      look
      how
      imagination
      blows
      him.

      Having

      him

      have
      challenged
      him.
      Let
      him
      let
      the

      I

      I
      hate

      but
      the
      beauteous-evil
   
      
      
      and
      I
      would
      I
      were
      the
      first

      They

      me
      in
      darkness,
      send
      ministers
      to
      me,
      asses,

      do
      all

      can
      to
      face
      me
      out

      such
      a

      An
      you
      smile
      not,
      he's
      gagged:
      And
      thus
      the

      Oli.
      O,
      you
      are
      sick
      of
      self-love,
      Malvolio,
      and
      taste
      with
      a
      distempered
      appetite.
      To
      be
      generous,
      guiltless
      and
      of
      free
      disposition,
      is
      to
      take
      those
      things
      for
      bird-bolts,
      that
      you
      deem
      cannon-bullets:
      There
      is
      no
      slander
      in
      an
      allowed
      fool,
      though
      he
      do
      nothing
      but
      rail;
      nor
      no
      railing
      in
      a
      known
      discreet
      man,
      though
      he
      do
      nothing
      but
      reprove.
   
      
      Unless
      the
      master
      were
      the
      man.
      â€”How
      now?
      Even
      so
      quickly
      may
      one
      catch
      the
      plague?
   
      
      Fate,
      show
      thy
      force:
      ourselves
      we
      do
      not
      owe;
      What
      is
      decreed,
      must
      be;
      and
      be
      this
      so!

      How
      easy
      is
      it
      for
      the
      proper-false
      In
      women's
      waxen
      hearts
      to
      set
      their
      forms!
      Alas,
      our
      frailty
      is
      the
      cause,
      not
      we;
      For
      such

      we
      are

      How

      My

      I,
      poor

      fond

      much
      on

      And
      she,
      mistaken,
      seems
      to
      dote

      me:
   
      
      after

      O

      mine,
      where
      are
      you
      roaming?
      O,
      stay
      and
      hear;
      your
      true
      love's
      coming,
      That
      can
      sing
      both
      high
      and
      low:
      Trip
      no
      farther,
      pretty
      sweeting;
      Journeys
      end
      in
      lovers'
      meeting,
      Every
      wise
      man's

      Clo.
      What
      is
      love?
      'tis
      not
      hereafter;
      Present
      mirth

      present
      laughter;
      What's
      to
      come
      is
      still
      unsure:
      In
      delay
      there
      lies
      no
      plenty;
      Then
      come
      kiss
      me,
      sweet-and-twenty,
      Youth's
      a
      stuff
      will
      not
      endure.
   
      
      than
      a
      steward?
      Dost
      thou
      think,
      because
      thou
      art
      virtuous,
      there
      shall
      be
      no
      more
      cakes
      and
      ale?
   
      
      since
      the
      youth
      of
      the
      count's
      was
      to-day
      with
      my
   
      
      Sir
      To.
      What,
      for
      being
      a
      Puritan?
      thy
      exquisite
   
      
      too
      late
      to
      go
      to
      bed
      now:
   
      
      An
      elder
      than
      herself;
      so
      wears
      she
      to
      him,
      So
      sways
      she
      level
      in
      her
      husband's
      heart.
      For,
      boy,
      however
      we
      do
      praise
      ourselves,
      Our
      fancies
      are
      more
      giddy
      and
      unfirm,
      More
      longing,
      wavering,
      sooner
      lost
      and
      worn
   
      
      The
      spinsters
      and
      the
      knitters
      in
      the
      sun,
      And
      the
      free
      maids
      that
      weave
      their
      thread
      with
      bones,
      Do
      use
      to
      chant
      it;
      it
      is
      silly
      sooth,
      And
      dallies
      with
      the
      innocence
      of
      love,
      Like
      the
      old
      age.

      deeply

      him.

      My

      none
      better

      than
      you
      How
      I
      have
      ever
      loved
      
         the
         life
         removed;
      
      And
      held
      in
      idle
      price
      to
      haunt
      assemblies,
      Where
      youth,
      and
      cost,
      and
      witless
      bravery
      keeps.
      I
      have
      delivered
      to
      lord
      Angelo
      (A
      man
      of
      stricture
      and
      firm
      abstinence)
   
      
         the
         life
         removed;
      
      
      And
      he,
      that
      suffers.
      O,
      it
      is
      excellent
      To
      have
      a
      giant's
      strength;
      but
      it
      is
      tyrannous
      To
      use
      it
      like
      a
      giant.
      Lucio.
      That's
      well
      said.
   
      
      Thou
      rather,
      with
      thy
      sharp
      and
      sulphurous
      bolt,
      Split'st
      the
      unwedgeable
      and

      authority,â€”
      Most
      ignorant
      of
      what
      he's
      most
      assured,
      His
      glassy
      essence,â€”
      like
      an
      angry
      ape,
      Plays
      such
      fantastic
      tricks
      before
      high
      Heaven,
      As
      make
      the
      angels
      weep;
      who,
      with
      our

      it

      To
      whom
      shall
      I
      complain?
      Did
      I
      tell
      this,
      Who
      would
      believe
      me?
      O
      perilous
      mouths,
      That
      bear
      in
      them
      one
      and
      the
      self-same
      tongue,
      Either
      of
      condemnation
      or
      approof!
   
      
      Are
      nursed
      by
      baseness.
      Thou
      art
      by
      no
      means
      valiant;
      For
      thou
      dost
      fear
      the
      soft
      and
      tender
      fork
      
         Of
         a
         poor
         worm.
         Thy
         best
         of
         rest
         is
         sleep,
         And
         that
         thou
         oft
         provok'st;
         yet
         grossly
         fear'st
      
      
         Thy
         death,
         which
         is
         no
         more.
      
      Thou
      art
      not
      thyself;
      For
      thou
      exist'st
      on
      many
      a
      thousand
      grains
      That
      issue
      out
      of
      dust.
      Happy
      thou
      art
      not;
      For
      what
      thou
      hast
      not,
      still
      thou
      striv'st
      to
      get;
      And
      what
      thou
      hast,
      forget'st.
      Thou
      art
      not
      certain;
      For
      thy
      complexion
      shifts
      to
      strange
      affects,
      After
      the
      moon.
      If
      thou
      art
      rich,
      thou
      art
      poor;
   
      
         Of
         a
         poor
         worm.
         Thy
         best
         of
         rest
         is
         sleep,
         And
         that
         thou
         oft
         provok'st;
         yet
         grossly
         fear'st
      
      
         Thy
         death,
         which
         is
         no
         more.
      
      
      For,
      like
      an
      ass,
      whose
      back
      with
      ingots
      bows,
      Thou
      bear'st
      thy
      heavy
      riches
      but
      a
      journey,
      And
      death
      unloads
      thee.
      Friend
      hast
      thou
      none;
      For
      thine
      own
      bowels,
      which
      do
      call
      thee
      sire,
      The
      mere
      effusion
      of
      thy
      proper
      loins,
      Do
      curse
      the
      gout,
      serpigo,
      and
      the
      rheum,
      For
      ending
      thee
      no
      sooner.
      Thou
      hast
      nor
      youth
      nor
      age;
      But,
      as
      it
      were,
      an
      after-dinner's
      sleep,
      Dreaming
      on
      both;
      for
      all
      thy
      blessed
      youth
      Becomes
      as
      aged,
      and
      doth
      beg
      the
      alms
      Of
      palsied
      eld;
      and
      when
      thou
      art
      old,
      and
      rich,
      Thou
      hast
      neither
      heat,
      affection,
      limb,
      nor
      beauty,
      To
      make
      thy
      riches
      pleasant.
      What's
      yet
      in
      this
      That
      bears
      the
      name
      of
      life?
      Yet
      in
      this
      life
      Lie
      hid
      more
      thousand
      deaths;
      yet
      death
      we
      fear,
      That
      makes
      these
      odds
      all
      even.
      Claud.
      I
      humbly
      thank
      you.
      To
      sue
      to
      live,
      I
      find,
      I
      seek
      to
      die:
      And
      seeking
      death,
      find
      life:
      let
      it
      come
      on.
   
      
      
         The
         sense
         of
         death
         is
         most
         in
         apprehension;
      
      And
      the
      poor
      beetle,
      that
      we
      tread
      upon,
      In
      corporal
      sufferance
      finds
      a
      pang
      as
      great
      As
      when
      a
      giant
      dies.
   
      
         The
         sense
         of
         death
         is
         most
         in
         apprehension;
      
      
      
         Whose
         settled
         visage
         and
         deliberate
         word
      
      Nips
      youth
      i'
      the
      head,
      and
      follies
      doth
      enmew,
   
      
         Whose
         settled
         visage
         and
         deliberate
         word
      
      
      Lucio.
      Sir,
      I
      know
      him,
      and
      I
      love
      him.
      Duke.
      Love
      talks
      with
      better
      knowledge,
      and
      knowledge
      with
      dearer
      love.
   
      
      Duke.
      No
      might
      nor
      greatness
      in
      mortality
      Can
      censure
      'scape:
      back-wounding
      calumny
      The
      whitest
      virtue
      strikes:
      what
      king
      so
      strong
      Can
      tie
      the
      gall
      up
      in
      the
      slanderous
      tongue?
   
      
      is
      only
      in
      request;
      and
      it
      is
      as
      dangerous
      to
      be
      aged
      in
      any
      kind
      of
      course,
      as
      it
      is
      virtuous
      to
      be
      constant
      in
      any
      undertaking.
      There
      is
      scarce
      truth
      enough
   
      
      O,
      what
      may
      man
      within
      him
      hide,
      Though
      angel
      on
      the
      outward
      side!
   
      
      
      I
      have
      sat
      here
      all
      day.
   
      
      Thou
      must
      be
      made
      immortal.
   
      
      Prov.
      
         His
         friends
      
      still
      wrought
      reprieves
      for
      him;
   
      
         His
         friends
      
      
      How
      seems
      he
      to
      be
      touched?
      Prov.
      A
      man
      that
      apprehends
      death
      no
      more
      dreadfully
      but
      as
      a
      drunken
      sleep
      careless,
      reckless,
      and
      fearless
      of
      what's
      past,
      present,
      or
      to
      come;
      insensible
   
      
      cover
      the
      favor.
      Duke.
      O,
      death's
      a
      great
      disguiser:
      and
      you
      may
   
      
      Abhor.
      Sirrah,
      bring
      Barnardine
      hither.
      Clo.
      Master
      Barnardine!
      You
      must
      rise
      and
      be
      hanged,
      master
      Barnardine!
      Abhor.
      What,
      ho,
      Barnardine!
      Barnar.
      [Within.]
      A
      pox
      o'
      your
      throats!
      Who
      makes
      that
      noise
      there?
      What
      are
      you?
      Clo.
      Your
      friends,
      sir;
      the
      hangman:
      you
      must
      be
      so
      good,
      sir,
      to
      rise
      and
      be
      put
      to
      death.
      Barnar.
      [Within.]
      Away,
      you
      rogue,
      away;
      I
      am
      sleepy.
      Abhor.
      Tell
      him,
      he
      must
      awake,
      and
      that
      quickly
      too.
      Clo.
      Pray,
      master
      Barnardine,
      awake
      till
      you
      are
      executed,
      and
      sleep
      afterwards.
      Abhor.
      Go
      in
      to
      him,
      and
      fetch
      him
      out.
      Clo.
      He
      is
      coming,
      sir,
      he
      is
      coming;
      I
      hear
      his
      straw
      rustle.
   
      
      Clo.
      O,
      the
      better,
      sir;
      for
      he
      that
      drinks
      all
      night,
      and
      is
      hanged
      betimes
      in
      the
      morning,
      may
      sleep
      the
      sounder
      all
      the
      next
      day.
   
      
      Duke.
      This
      nor
      hurts
      him,
      nor
      profits
      you
      a
      jot:
   
      
      For
      my
      authority
      bears
      a
      credent
      bulk,
      That
      no
      particular
      scandal
      once
      can
      touch,
      But
      it
      confounds
      the
      breather.
      He
      should
      have
      lived,
      Save
      that
      his
      riotous
      youth,
      with
      dangerous
      sense,
   
      
      Duke.
      Away
      with
      her:
      â€”poor
      soul.
      She
      speaks
      this
      in
      the
      infirmity
      of
      sense.
      Isab.
      O
      prince,
      I
      conjure
      thee,
      as
      thou
      believest
      There
      is
      another
      comfort
      than
      this
      world,
      That
      thou
      neglect
      me
      not,
      with
      that
      opinion
      
         That
         I
         am
         touched
         with
         madness:
      
      make
      not
      impossible
      That
      which
      but
      seems
      unlike:
      'tis
      not
      impossible
   
      
         That
         I
         am
         touched
         with
         madness:
      
      
      But
      one,
      the
      wicked'st
      caitiff
      on
      the
      ground,
      May
      seem
      as
      shy,
      as
      grave,
      as
      just,
      as
      absolute,
      As
      Angelo;
      even
      so
      may
      Angelo,
   
      
      To
      speak
      before
      your
      time.
      â€”Proceed.
      Isab.
      I
      went
      To
      this
      pernicious
      caitiff
      deputy.
   
      
      That's
      somewhat
      madly
      spoken.
   
      
      Isab.
      O,
      that
      it
      were
      as
      like
      as
      it
      is
      true!
   
      
      Where
      I
      have
      seen
      corruption
      boil
      and
      bubble,
      Till
      it
      o'errun
      the
      stew;
      laws,
      for
      all
      faults;
      But
      faults
      so
      countenanced,
      that
      the
      strong
      statutes
      Stand
      like
      the
      forfeits
      in
      a
      barber's
      shop,
      As
      much
      in
      mock
      as
      mark.
   
      
      Which
      I
      did
      think
      with
      slower
      foot
      came
      on,
      That
      brained
      my
      purpose:
      but
      peace
      be
      with
      him!
      That
      life
      is
      better
      life,
      past
      fearing
      death,
      Than
      that
      which
      lives
      to
      fear:
      make
      it
      your
      comfort,
      So
      happy
      is
      your
      brother.
   
      
      Sweet
      Isabel,
      do
      yet
      but
      kneel
      by
      me;
      Hold
      up
      your
      hands;
      say
      nothing;
      I'll
      speak
      all.
      They
      say,
      best
      men
      are
      moulded
      out
      of
      faults;
      And,
      for
      the
      most,
      become
      much
      more
      the
      better
      For
      being
      a
      little
      bad:
      so
      may
      my
      husband.
   
      
      Let
      him
      not
      die:
      My
      brother
      had
      but
      justice,
      In
      that
      he
      did
      the
      thing
      for
      which
      he
      died:
      For
      Angelo,
      His
      act
      did
      not
      o'ertake
      his
      bad
      intent;
      And
      must
      be
      buried
      but
      as
      an
      intent
      That
      perished
      by
      the
      way:
      thoughts
      are
      no
      subjects;
      Intents
      but
      merely
      thoughts.

      Heaven
      doth
      with
      us,

      Not

      our

      The

      like
      a

      she
      determines
      Herself
      the

      Duke.
      My
      holy
      sir,
      none
      better
      knows
      than
      you
      How
      I
      have
      ever
      loved
      
         the
         life
         removed;
      
      And
      held
      in
      idle
      price
      to
      haunt
      assemblies,
      Where
      youth,
      and
      cost,
      and
      witless
      bravery
      keeps.
      I
      have
      delivered
      to
      lord
      Angelo
      (A
      man
      of
      stricture
      and
      firm
      abstinence)
   
      
         the
         life
         removed;
      
      
      And
      he,
      that
      suffers.
      O,
      it
      is
      excellent
      To
      have
      a
      giant's
      strength;
      but
      it
      is
      tyrannous
      To
      use
      it
      like
      a
      giant.
      Lucio.
      That's
      well
      said.
   
      
      Thou
      rather,
      with
      thy
      sharp
      and
      sulphurous
      bolt,
      Split'st
      the
      unwedgeable
      and
      gnarled
      oak,
      Than
      the
      soft
      myrtle:
      â€”But
      man,
      proud
      man!
      Dressed
      in
      a
      little
      brief
      authority,â€”
      Most
      ignorant
      of
      what
      he's
      most
      assured,
      His
      glassy
      essence,â€”
      like
      an
      angry
      ape,
      Plays
      such
      fantastic
      tricks
      before
      high
      Heaven,
      As
      make
      the
      angels
      weep;
      who,
      with
      our
      spleens,
      Would
      all
      themselves
      laugh
      mortal.

      O,
      to
      him,
      to
      him,
      wench:
      he
      will
      relent;
      He's
      coming;
      I
      perceive't.
   
      
      Great
      men

      jest
      with

      in
      them!
      But,
      in
      the
      less,
      foul
      profanation.

      Why
      do
      you
      put
      these
      sayings
      upon
      me?

      Because
      authority,
      though
      it
      err
      like
      others,
      Hath
      yet
      a
      kind
      of
      medicine
      in
      itself,
      That
      skins
      the
      vice
      o'
      the
      top:
      go
      to
      your
      bosom;
   
      
      The
      tempter,
      or
      the
      tempted,
      who
      sins
      most?
      Ha!
      Not
      she;
      nor
      doth
      she
      tempt:
      but
      it
      is
      I,
      That,
      lying
      by
      the
      violet,
      in
      the
      sun,
      Do,
      as
      the
      carrion
      does,
      not
      as
      the
      flower,
      Corrupt
      with
      virtuous
      season.
      Can
      it
      be,
      That
      modesty
      may
      more
      betray
      our
      sense

      Hail
      to
      you,

      Bound
      by

      visit
      the
      afflicted

      do
      me
      the
      common
      right
      To
      let
      me
      see
      them;
      and
      to
      make
      me
      know
      The
      nature
      of
      their
      crimes,
      that
      I
      may
      minister
   
      
      Grown
      feared
      and
      tedious;
      yea
      my
      gravity,
      Wherein
      (let
      no
      man
      hear
      me)
      I
      take
      pride,
      Could
      I,
      with
      boot,
      change
      for
      an
      idle
      plume,
      Which
      the
      air
      beats
      for
      vain.
      O
      place!
      O
      form!
   
      
      How
      often
      dost
      thou
      with
      thy
      case,
      thy
      habit,
      Wrench
      awe
      from
      fools,
      and
      tie
      the
      wiser
      souls
      To
      thy
      false
      seeming?

      now
      guides

      most,
      I'll
      prove

      hast,
      forget'st.
      Thou
      art
      not
      certain;
      For
      thy
      complexion
      shifts
      to
      strange
      affects,
      After
      the
      moon.
      If
      thou
      art
      rich,
      thou
      art
      poor;
   
      
         Of
         a
         poor
         worm.
         Thy
         best
         of
         rest
         is
         sleep,
         And
         that
         thou
         oft
         provok'st;
         yet
         grossly
         fear'st
      
      
         Thy
         death,
         which
         is
         no
         more.
      
      
      For,
      like
      an
      ass,
      whose
      back
      with
      ingots
      bows,
      Thou
      bear'st
      thy
      heavy
      riches
      but
      a
      journey,
      And
      death
      unloads
      thee.
      Friend
      hast
      thou
      none;
      For
      thine
      own
      bowels,
      which
      do
      call
      thee
      sire,
      The
      mere
      effusion
      of
      thy
      proper
      loins,
      Do
      curse
      the
      gout,
      serpigo,
      and
      the
      rheum,
      For
      ending
      thee
      no
      sooner.
      Thou
      hast
      nor
      youth
      nor
      age;
      But,
      as
      it
      were,
      an
      after-dinner's
      sleep,
      Dreaming
      on
      both;
      for
      all
      thy
      blessed
      youth
      Becomes
      as
      aged,
      and
      doth
      beg
      the
      alms
      Of
      palsied
      eld;
      and
      when
      thou
      art
      old,
      and
      rich,
      Thou
      hast
      neither
      heat,
      affection,
      limb,
      nor
      beauty,
      To
      make
      thy
      riches
      pleasant.
      What's
      yet
      in
      this
      That
      bears
      the
      name
      of
      life?
      Yet
      in
      this
      life
      Lie
      hid
      more
      thousand
      deaths;
      yet
      death
      we
      fear,
      That
      makes
      these
      odds
      all
      even.
      Claud.
      I
      humbly
      thank
      you.
      To
      sue
      to
      live,
      I
      find,
      I
      seek
      to
      die:
      And
      seeking
      death,
      find
      life:
      let
      it
      come
      on.
   
      
      
         The
         sense
         of
         death
         is
         most
         in
         apprehension;
      
      And
      the
      poor
      beetle,
      that
      we
      tread
      upon,
      In
      corporal
      sufferance
      finds
      a
      pang
      as
      great
      As
      when
      a
      giant
      dies.
   
      
         The
         sense
         of
         death
         is
         most
         in
         apprehension;
      
      
      
         Whose
         settled
         visage
         and
         deliberate
         word
      
      Nips
      youth
      i'
      the
      head,
      and
      follies
      doth
      enmew,
   
      
         Whose
         settled
         visage
         and
         deliberate
         word
      
      
      Lucio.
      Sir,
      I
      know
      him,
      and
      I
      love
      him.
      Duke.
      Love
      talks
      with
      better
      knowledge,
      and
      knowledge
      with
      dearer
      love.
   
      
      Duke.
      No
      might
      nor
      greatness
      in
      mortality
      Can
      censure
      'scape:
      back-wounding
      calumny
      The
      whitest
      virtue
      strikes:
      what
      king
      so
      strong
      Can
      tie
      the
      gall
      up
      in
      the
      slanderous
      tongue?
   
      
      is
      only
      in
      request;
      and
      it
      is
      as
      dangerous
      to
      be
      aged
      in
      any
      kind
      of
      course,
      as
      it
      is
      virtuous
      to
      be
      constant
      in
      any
      undertaking.
      There
      is
      scarce
      truth
      enough
   
      
      O,
      what
      may
      man
      within
      him
      hide,
      Though
      angel
      on
      the
      outward
      side!
   
      
      
      I
      have
      sat
      here
      all
      day.
   
      
      Thou
      must
      be
      made
      immortal.

         His

      him;
   
      
         His
         friends
      
      
      How
      seems
      he
      to
      be
      touched?
      Prov.
      A
      man
      that
      apprehends
      death
      no
      more
      dreadfully
      but
      as
      a

      careless,
      reckless,
      and
      fearless

      Duke.
      O,
      death's
      a
      great
      disguiser:
      and
      you
      may
   
      
      Abhor.
      Sirrah,
      bring
      Barnardine
      hither.
      Clo.
      Master
      Barnardine!
      You
      must
      rise
      and
      be
      hanged,
      master
      Barnardine!
      Abhor.
      What,
      ho,
      Barnardine!
      Barnar.
      [Within.]
      A
      pox
      o'
      your
      throats!
      Who
      makes
      that
      noise
      there?
      What
      are
      you?
      Clo.
      Your
      friends,
      sir;
      the
      hangman:
      you
      must
      be
      so
      good,
      sir,
      to
      rise
      and
      be
      put
      to
      death.
      Barnar.
      [Within.]
      Away,
      you
      rogue,
      away;
      I
      am
      sleepy.
      Abhor.
      Tell
      him,
      he
      must
      awake,
      and
      that
      quickly
      too.
      Clo.
      Pray,
      master
      Barnardine,
      awake
      till
      you
      are
      executed,
      and
      sleep
      afterwards.
      Abhor.
      Go
      in
      to
      him,
      and
      fetch
      him
      out.
      Clo.
      He
      is
      coming,
      sir,
      he
      is
      coming;
      I
      hear
      his
      straw
      rustle.
   
      
      Clo.
      O,
      the
      better,
      sir;
      for
      he
      that
      drinks
      all
      night,
      and
      is
      hanged
      betimes
      in
      the
      morning,
      may
      sleep
      the
      sounder
      all
      the
      next
      day.
   
      
      Duke.
      This
      nor
      hurts
      him,
      nor
      profits
      you
      a
      jot:
   
      
      For
      my
      authority
      bears
      a
      credent
      bulk,
      That
      no
      particular
      scandal
      once
      can
      touch,
      But
      it
      confounds
      the
      breather.
      He
      should
      have
      lived,
      Save
      that
      his
      riotous
      youth,
      with
      dangerous
      sense,
   
      
      Duke.
      Away

      her:
      â€”poor
      soul.
      She

      Isab.
      O
      prince,
      I
      conjure
      thee,
      as
      thou
      believest
      There
      is
      another
      comfort
      than
      this
      world,
      That
      thou
      neglect
      me
      not,
      with
      that
      opinion
      
         That
         I
         am
         touched
         with
         madness:
      
      make
      not
      impossible
      That
      which
      but
      seems
      unlike:
      'tis
      not
      impossible
   
      
         That
         I
         am
         touched
         with
         madness:
      
      
      But
      one,
      the
      wicked'st
      caitiff
      on
      the
      ground,
      May
      seem
      as
      shy,
      as
      grave,
      as
      just,
      as
      absolute,
      As
      Angelo;
      even
      so
      may
      Angelo,
   
      
      To
      speak
      before
      your
      time.
      â€”Proceed.
      Isab.
      I
      went
      To
      this
      pernicious
      caitiff
      deputy.
   
      
      That's
      somewhat
      madly
      spoken.
   
      
      Isab.
      O,
      that
      it
      were
      as
      like
      as
      it
      is
      true!
   
      
      Where
      I
      have
      seen
      corruption
      boil
      and
      bubble,
      Till
      it
      o'errun
      the
      stew;
      laws,
      for
      all
      faults;
      But
      faults
      so
      countenanced,
      that
      the
      strong
      statutes
      Stand
      like
      the
      forfeits
      in
      a
      barber's
      shop,
      As
      much
      in
      mock
      as
      mark.
   
      
      Which
      I
      did
      think
      with
      slower
      foot
      came
      on,
      That
      brained
      my
      purpose:
      but
      peace
      be
      with
      him!
      That
      life
      is
      better
      life,
      past
      fearing
      death,
      Than
      that
      which
      lives
      to
      fear:
      make
      it
      your
      comfort,
      So
      happy
      is
      your
      brother.
   
      
      Sweet
      Isabel,
      do
      yet
      but
      kneel
      by
      me;
      Hold
      up
      your
      hands;
      say
      nothing;
      I'll
      speak
      all.
      They
      say,
      best
      men
      are
      moulded
      out
      of
      faults;
      And,
      for
      the
      most,
      become
      much
      more
      the
      better
      For
      being
      a
      little
      bad:
      so
      may
      my
      husband.
   
      
      Let
      him
      not
      die:
      My
      brother
      had
      but
      justice,
      In
      that
      he
      did
      the
      thing
      for
      which
      he
      died:
      For
      Angelo,
      His
      act
      did
      not
      o'ertake
      his
      bad
      intent;
      And
      must
      be
      buried
      but
      as
      an
      intent
      That
      perished
      by
      the
      way:
      thoughts
      are
      no
      subjects;
      Intents
      but
      merely
      thoughts.

      it
      is
      to
      weep

      But
      how
      many
      hath
      he
      killed?
      For,
      indeed,

      you
      have

      Bene.
      That
      a
      woman
      conceived
      me,
      I
      thank
      her;
      that
      she
      brought
      me
      up,
      I
      likewise
      give
      her
      most
      humble
      thanks;
      but
      that
      I
      will
      have
      a
      recheat
      winded
      in
      my
      forehead,
      or
      hang
      my
      bugle
      in
      an
      invisible
      baldrick,
      all
      women
      shall
      pardon
      me:
      because
      I
      will
      not
      do
      them
      the
      wrong
      to
      mistrust
      any,
      I
      will
      do
      myself
      the
      right
      to
      trust
      none;
      and
      the
      fine
      is,

      the

      I

      D.
      John.
      I
      wonder,
      that
      thou,
      being
      (as
      thou
      say'st
      thou
      art)
      born
      under
      Saturn,
      goest
      about
      to
      apply
      a
      moral
      medicine
      to
      a
      mortifying
      mischief.
      I
      cannot
      hide
      what
      I
      am:
      I
      must
      be
      sad
      when
      I
      have
      cause,
      and
      smile
      at
      no
      man's
      jests;
      eat
      when
      I
      have
      stomach,
      and
      wait
      for
      no
      man's
      leisure;
      sleep
      when
      I
      am
      drowsy,
   
      
      and
      say,
      Get
      you
      to
      heaven,
      Beatrice,
      get
      you
      to
      heaven;
      here's
      no
      place
      for
      you
      maids:
      so
      deliver
      I
      up
      my
      apes,
      and
      away
      to
      Saint
      Peter
      for
      the
      heavens;
      he
      shows
      me
      where
      the
      bachelors
      sit,
      and
      there
      live
      we
      as
      merry
      as
      the
      day
      is
      long.
   
      
      wooing,
      wedding,
      and
      repenting,
      is
      as
      a
      Scotch
      jig,
      a
      measure,
      and
      a
      cinque-pace;
      the
      first
      suit
      is
      hot
      and
      hasty,
      like
      a
      Scotch
      jig,
      and
      full
      as
      fantastical;
      the
      wedding,
      mannerly-modest,
      as
      a
      measure
      full
      of
      state
      and
      ancientry;
      and
      then
      comes
      repentance,
      and,
      with
      his
      bad
      legs,
      falls
      into
      the
      cinque-pace
      faster
      and
      faster,
      till
      he
      sink
      into
      his
      grave.

      news
      with
      the
      ears
      of

      'Tis
      certain
      so;

      himself.

      in
      the
      office
      and
      affairs
      of
      love:
      Therefore,
      all
      hearts
      in
      love
      use
      their
      own
      tongues;
      Let
      every
      eye
      negotiate
      for

      It

      O
      God
      of
      love!
      I
      know,
      he
      doth
      deserve
      As
      much
      as
      may
      be
      yielded
      to
      a

      woman's
      heart
      Of
      prouder

      than
      that

      Disdain
      and
      scorn
      ride
      sparkling
      in
      her
      eyes,
      Misprising
      what
      they
      look
      on;
      and
      her
      wit
      Values
      itself
      so
      highly,
      that
      to
      her
      All
      matter
      else
      seems
      weak.
      She
      cannot
      love,
      Nor
      take
      no
      shape
      nor
      project
      of
      affection,

      Taming

      That

      thou

      Thou
   
      
      There,
      Leonato,
      take
      her
      back
      again.
      Give
      not
      this
      rotten
      orange
      to
      your
      friend:
      She's
      but
      the
      sign
      and
      semblance
      of
      her
      honor.
      Behold,
      how
      like
      a
      maid
      she
      blushes
      here.
      O,
      what
      authority
      and
      show
      of
      truth
      Can
      cunning
      sin
      cover
      itself
      withal!
      Comes
      not
      that
      blood,
      as
      modest
      evidence,
      To
      witness
      simple
      virtue?
      Would
      you
      not
      swear,
      All
      you
      that
      see
      her,
      that
      she
      were
      a
      maid,
      By
      these
      exterior
      shows?â€”
      But
      she
      is
      none.
      She
      knows
      the
      heat
      of
      a
      luxurious
      bed;
      Her
      blush
      is
      guiltiness,
      not
      modesty.
   
      
      Shall
      be
      lamented,
      pitied,
      and
      excused,
      Of
      every
      hearer;
      for
      it
      so
      falls
      out,
      That
      what
      we
      have,
      we
      prize
      not
      to
      the
      worth,
      Whiles
      we
      enjoy
      it;
      but
      being
      lacked
      and
      lost,
      Why,
      then
      we
      rack
      the
      value;
      then
      we
      find
      The
      virtue,
      that
      possession
      would
      not
      show
      us
   
      
      Nor
      let
      no
      comforter
      delight
      mine
      ear,
      But
      such
      a
      one
      whose
      wrongs
      do
      suit
      with
      mine.
      Bring
      me
      a
      father,
      that
      so
      loved
      his
      child,
      Whose
      joy
      of
      her
      is
      overwhelmed
      like
      mine,
      And
      bid
      him
      speak
      of
      patience;
      Measure
      his
      woe
      the
      length
      and
      breadth
      of
      mine,
      And
      let
      it
      answer
      every
      strain
      for
      strain;
      As
      thus
      for
      thus,
      and
      such
      a
      grief
      for
      such,
      In
      every
      lineament,
      branch,
      shape,
      and
      form.
      If
      such
      a
      one
      will
      smile,
      and
      stroke
      his
      beard;
      
         Cryâ€”
         sorrow,
         wag!
         and
         hem,
         when
         he
         should
         groan;
         
            Patch
            grief
            with
            proverbs;
         
         make
         misfortune
         drunk
      
      With
      
         candle-wasters;
      
      bring
      him
      yet
      to
      me,
      And
      I
      of
      him
      will
      gather
      patience.
      But
      there
      is
      no
      such
      man;
      for,
      brother,
      men
      Can
      counsel,
      and
      speak
      comfort
      to
      that
      grief

      That

      conceived
      me,
      I
      thank
      her;
      that

      brought
      me
      up,
      I
      likewise
      give

      most
      humble
      thanks;

      shall
      pardon

      because
      I

      not
      do
      them
      the
      wrong
      to
      mistrust

      I

      thou

      born

      goest

      a
      moral
      medicine
      to
      a
      mortifying
      mischief.
      I
      cannot
      hide
      what
      I
      am:
      I
      must
      be
      sad
      when
      I
      have
      cause,
      and
      smile
      at
      no
      man's
      jests;
      eat
      when
      I
      have
      stomach,
      and
      wait
      for
      no
      man's
      leisure;
      sleep
      when
      I
      am
      drowsy,

      to

      get
      you
      to

      here's
      no
      place
      for
      you
      maids:
      so
      deliver
      I
      up
      my
      apes,
      and
      away
      to
      Saint
      Peter
      for
      the
      heavens;
      he
      shows
      me
      where
      the
      bachelors
      sit,
      and
      there
      live
      we
      as

      the
      day

      and
      full
      as
      fantastical;
      the
      wedding,
      mannerly-modest,
      as
      a
      measure
      full
      of
      state
      and
      ancientry;
      and
      then
      comes
      repentance,
      and,
      with
      his
      bad
      legs,
      falls
      into
      the
      cinque-pace
      faster
      and
      faster,
      till

      'Tis

      all

      on;
      I
      will
      requite
      thee;
      Taming
      my
      wild
      heart
      to
      thy
      loving
      hand;
   
      
      any
      villany
      should
      be
      so
      rich;
      for
      when
      rich
      villains
      have
      need
      of
      poor
      ones,
      poor
      ones
      may
      make
      what
      price
      they
      will.
   
      
      Bora.
      That
      shows
      thou
      art
      unconfirmed.
      Thou
   
      
      There,
      Leonato,
      take
      her
      back
      again.
      Give
      not
      this
      rotten
      orange
      to
      your
      friend:
      She's
      but
      the
      sign
      and
      semblance
      of
      her
      honor.
      Behold,
      how
      like
      a
      maid
      she
      blushes
      here.
      O,
      what
      authority
      and
      show
      of
      truth
      Can
      cunning
      sin
      cover
      itself
      withal!
      Comes
      not
      that
      blood,
      as
      modest
      evidence,
      To
      witness
      simple
      virtue?
      Would
      you
      not
      swear,
      All
      you
      that
      see
      her,
      that
      she
      were
      a
      maid,
      By
      these
      exterior
      shows?â€”
      But
      she
      is
      none.
      She
      knows
      the
      heat
      of
      a
      luxurious
      bed;
      Her
      blush
      is
      guiltiness,
      not
      modesty.
   
      
      Shall
      be
      lamented,
      pitied,
      and
      excused,
      Of
      every
      hearer;
      for
      it
      so
      falls
      out,
      That
      what
      we
      have,
      we
      prize
      not
      to
      the
      worth,
      Whiles
      we
      enjoy
      it;
      but
      being
      lacked
      and
      lost,
      Why,
      then
      we
      rack
      the
      value;
      then
      we
      find
      The
      virtue,
      that
      possession
      would
      not
      show
      us
   
      
      Nor
      let
      no
      comforter
      delight
      mine
      ear,
      But
      such
      a
      one
      whose
      wrongs
      do
      suit
      with
      mine.
      Bring
      me
      a
      father,
      that
      so
      loved
      his
      child,
      Whose
      joy
      of
      her
      is
      overwhelmed
      like
      mine,
      And
      bid
      him
      speak
      of
      patience;
      Measure
      his
      woe
      the
      length
      and
      breadth
      of
      mine,
      And
      let
      it
      answer
      every
      strain
      for
      strain;
      As
      thus
      for
      thus,
      and
      such
      a
      grief
      for
      such,
      In
      every
      lineament,
      branch,
      shape,
      and
      form.
      If
      such
      a
      one
      will
      smile,
      and
      stroke
      his
      beard;
      
         Cryâ€”
         sorrow,
         wag!
         and
         hem,
         when
         he
         should
         groan;
         
            Patch
            grief
            with
            proverbs;
         
         make
         misfortune
         drunk
      
      With
      
         candle-wasters;
      
      bring
      him
      yet
      to
      me,
      And
      I
      of
      him
      will
      gather
      patience.
      But
      there
      is
      no
      such
      man;
      for,
      brother,
      men
      Can
      counsel,
      and
      speak
      comfort
      to
      that
      grief
      Which
      they
      themselves
      not
      feel;
      but,
      tasting
      it,
      Their
      counsel
      turns
      to
      passion,
      which
      before
      Would
      give
      preceptial
      medicine.
      to
      rage,
      Fetter
      strong
      madness
      in
      a
      silken
      thread,
      Charm
      ache
      with
      air,
      and
      agony
      with
      words.
      No,
      no;
      'tis
      all
      men's
      office
      to
      speak
      patience
      To
      those
      that
      wring
      under
      the
      load
      of
      sorrow;
      But
      no
      man's
      virtue,
      nor
      sufficiency,
      To
      be
      so
      moral,
      when
      he
      shall
      endure
      The
      like

      Therefore
      give
      me
      no
      counsel;
      My

      cry
      louder

      Therein

         and

      I
      pray
      thee,
      peace.
      I
      will
      be
      flesh
      and
      blood;
      For
      there
      was
      never
      yet
      philosopher,
      That
      could
      endure
      the
      tooth-ache
      patiently;
      However
      they
      have
      writ
      the
      style
      of
      gods,
      And
      made
      a
      push
      at
      chance
      and
      sufferance.
   
      
      in
      the
      time
      of
      good
      neighbors.
      If
      a
      man
      do
      not
      erect
      in
      this
      age
      his
      own
      tomb
      ere 
      he
      dies,
      he
      shall
      live
      no
      longer
      in
      monument,
      than
      the
      bell
      rings,

      that
      the

      can
      say

      and
      therefore
      never
      
         flout
         at
         me
         for
         what
         I
         have
         said
         against

         and
         this
         is
         my
         conclusion.
         â€”For
         thy
      
      part,
      Claudio,
      I
      did
      think

      beaten
      thee;
      but
      in
      that
      thou
      art
      like
      to

         is
         
            a

            thing,
         
         and
         this
         is

      Ay,
      by
      my
      life;
      And
      never
      did
      desire
      to

      you
      come
      by
      night,

      Fine,

      Ay,
      that

      Now
      I
      perceive
      that
      she
      hath

      she

      urged
      her
      height,
      And
      with
      her
      personage,
      her
      tall
      personage,
      Her
      height,
      forsooth,
      she
      hath
      prevailed

      so
      high
      in

         Because
         I
         am
         so
         dwarfish,

         so

         How

      I
      pray
      you,
      though
      you

      me,
      gentlemen,
      Let

      me.
      I
      was
      never

         I
         have
         no
         gift
         at
         all
         in
         shrewishness;
      
      I
      am
      a
      right
      maid
      for
      my
      cowardice;
      
         Let
         her
         not
         strike
         me.
         
            You,
            perhaps,
            may
            think,
            Because
            she's
            something
            lower
            than
            myself,
            That
            I
            can
            match
            her.

         Good
         Hermia,
         do

         be
         so
         bitter
         with
         me.
         I
         evermore
         did
         love
         you,
         Hermia,
         Did
         ever
         keep
         your
         counsels,
         never
         wronged
         you;
         Save
         that,
         in
         love
         unto
         Demetrius,
         I
         told
         him
         of
         your
         stealth
         unto
         this
         wood.
         He
         followed
         you;
         for
         love,
         I
         followed
         him.
         But
         he
         hath
         chid
         me
         hence,
         and
         threatened
         me
         To
         strike
         me,
         spurn
         me,
         nay,
         to
         kill
         me
         too:
         And
         now,
         so
         you
         will
         let
         me
         quiet
         go,
         To
         Athens

         I
         bear

         no

         Let
         me

         You
         see
         how
         simple
         and
         how

      I
      was
      with

      Cadmus,
      once,
      When
      in
      a

      of
      Crete
      they
      bayed

      Ay,
      by

      And
      never

      No
      touch
      of

      What,
      will
      you
      tear
      Impatient

      my

      Ay,
      that
      way

      Now
      I
      perceive
      that
      she
      hath
      made

      statures;
      she
      hath
      urged
      her
      height,
      And
      with
      her
      personage,
      her
      tall
      personage,
      Her
      height,
      forsooth,
      she
      hath
      prevailed
      with
      him.â€”
      And
      are
      you
      grown
      so
      high
      in
      his
      esteem,
      
         Because
         I
         am
         so
         dwarfish,
         and
         so
         low?
         How
         low
         am
         I,
         thou
         painted

      leaves

      buds

         Because
         I
         am
         so
         dwarfish,
         and
         so

      nails
      can
      reach
      unto
      thine
      eyes.

      I
      pray
      you,
      though
      you
      mock
      me,
      gentlemen,
      Let
      her
      not
      hurt
      me.
      I
      was
      never
      curst;
      
         I
         have
         no
         gift
         at
         all
         in
         shrewishness;
      
      I
      am
      a
      right
      maid
      for
      my
      cowardice;
      
         Let
         her
         not
         strike
         me.
         
            You,
            perhaps,
            may
            think,
            Because
            she's
            something
            lower
            than
            myself,
            That
            I
            can
            match
            her.
         
         Her:
         Lower!
         Hark,
         again.
         Hel.
         Good
         Hermia,
         do
         not
         be
         so
         bitter
         with
         me.
         I
         evermore
         did
         love
         you,
         Hermia,
         Did
         ever
         keep
         your
         counsels,
         never
         wronged
         you;
         Save
         that,
         in
         love
         unto
         Demetrius,
         I
         told
         him
         of
         your
         stealth
         unto
         this
         wood.
         He
         followed
         you;
         for
         love,
         I
         followed
         him.
         But
         he
         hath
         chid
         me
         hence,
         and
         threatened
         me
         To

      By
      yea
      and
      nay,
      sir,
      then
      I
      swore
      in
      jest.
      What
      is
      the
      end
      of
      study?
      Let
      me
      know.
      King.
      Why,
      that
      to
      know,
      which
      else
      we
      should
      not
      know.
      Biron.

      barred,
      you
      mean,

      sense?
      King.
      Ay,
      that
      is
      study's
      godlike
      recompense.
      Biron.
      Come
      on
      then;
      I
      will
      swear
      to
      study
      so,
      To
      know
      the
      thing
      I
      am
      forbid
      to
      know.
      As
      thusâ€”
      To
      study
      where
      I
      well
      may
      dine,
      When
      I
      to
      feast
      expressly
      am
      forbid;
   
      
      And
      train
      our
      intellects
      to
      vain
      delight.
      Biron.
      Why,
      all
      delights
      are
      vain;
      but
      that
      most
      vain,
      Which,
      with
      pain
      purchased,
      doth
      inherit

      By
      yea
      and
      nay,
      sir,
      then
      I
      swore
      in
      jest.
      What
      is
      the
      end
      of
      study?
      Let
      me
      know.
      King.
      Why,
      that
      to
      know,
      which
      else
      we
      should
      not
      know.

      Things
      hid
      and
      barred,
      you
      mean,
      from
      common
      sense?
      King.
      Ay,
      that
      is
      study's
      godlike
      recompense.
      Biron.
      Come
      on
      then;
      I
      will
      swear
      to
      study
      so,
      To
      know
      the
      thing
      I
      am
      forbid
      to
      know.
      As
      thusâ€”
      To
      study
      where
      I
      well
      may
      dine,
      When
      I
      to
      feast
      expressly
      am
      forbid;
   
      
      And
      train
      our
      intellects
      to
      vain
      delight.
      Biron.
      Why,
      all
      delights
      are
      vain;
      but
      that
      most
      vain,
      Which,
      with
      pain
      purchased,
      doth
      inherit
      pain.

         Had
         he
         been
         Adam,
         he
         had
         tempted
         Eve.
      
      
            Biron.
            This
            fellow
            pecks
            up
            wit,
            as
            pigeons
            peas;
            And
            utters
            it
            again
            when
            Jove
            doth
            please.
            He
            is
            wit's
            pedler,
            and
            retails
            his
            wares
            At
            wakes
            and
            wassels,
            meetings,

      Dum.
      I
      think,
      Hector
      was
      not
      so
      clean-timbered.
      Long.
      His
      leg
      is
      too
      big
      for
      Hector.
   
      
      A
      jest's
      prosperity
      lies
      in
      the
      ear
      Of
      him
      that
      hears
      it,
      never
      in
      the
      tongue
      Of
      him
      that
      makes
      it.
      Then,
      if
      sickly
      ears,
   
      
      This
      side
      is
      Hiems,
      winter;
      this
      Ver,
      the
      spring;
      the
      one
      maintained
      by
      the
      owl,
      the
      other
      by
      the
      cuckoo.
      Ver,

      Most
      mischievous,
      foul
      sin,
      in
      chiding
      sin;
      For

      thyself
      hast
      been
      a
      libertine,
   
      
      Touch.
      Truly,
      shepherd,
      in
      respect
      of
      itself,
      it
      is
      a
      good
      life;
      but
      in
      respect
      that
      it
      is
      a
      shepherd's
      life,
      it
      is
      naught.
      In
      respect
      that
      it
      is
      solitary,
      I
      like
      it
      very
      well;
      but
      in
      respect
      that
      it
      is
      private,
      it
      is
      a
      very
      vile
      life.
      Now,
      in
      respect
      it
      is
      in
      the
      fields,
      it
      pleaseth
      me
      well;
      but
      in
      respect
      it
      is
      not
      in
      the
      court,
      it
      is
      tedious.
      As
      it
      is
      a
      spare
      life,
      look
      you,
      it
      fits
      my
      humor
      well;
      but
      as
      there
      is
      no
      more
      plenty
      in
      it,
      it
      goes
      much
      against
      my
      stomach.
      Hast
      any
      philosophy
      in
      thee,

      and
      I

      every

      to
      woo
      me
      :

      grieve,
      be

      changeable,
      longing,
      and
      liking;
      proud,
      fantastical,
      apish,
      shallow,
      inconstant,
      full
      of
      tears,
      full
      of
      smiles;
      for
      every
      passion
      something,
      and
      for
      no
      passion
      truly
      any
      thing,
      as

      A
      traveller!
      By
      my
      faith,
      you
      have
      great
      reason
      to
      be
      sad;
      I
      fear
      you
      have
      sold
      your
      own
      lands,
      to
      see
      other
      men's;
      then,
      to
      have
      seen
      much,
      and
      to
      have
      nothing,
      is
      to
      have
      rich
      eyes
      and
      poor
      hands.
   
      
      bid
      the
      duke
      to
      the
      nuptial.
      But,
      O,
      how
      bitter
      a
      thing
      it
      is
      to
      look
      into
      happiness

      They
      are
      as
      innocent
      as
      grace
      itself.â€”
      Let
      it
      suffice
      thee,
      that
      I
      trust
      thee
      not.
   
      
      Your
      praise
      is
      come
      too
      swiftly

      before
      you.
      Know
      you
      not,
      master,
      to
      some
      kind
      of

      Their
      graces
      serve
      them

      as
      enemies?

      yours;

      Are
      sanctified
      and
      holy
      traitors
      to
      you.
      
         O,
         what
         a

      Most
      mischievous,
      foul
      sin,

      Truly,
      shepherd,
      in
      respect
      of
      itself,
      it
      is
      a
      good
      life;
      but
      in
      respect
      that
      it
      is
      a
      shepherd's
      life,
      it
      is
      naught.
      In
      respect
      that
      it
      is
      solitary,
      I
      like
      it
      very
      well;
      but
      in
      respect
      that
      it
      is
      private,
      it
      is
      a
      very
      vile
      life.
      Now,
      in
      respect
      it
      is
      in
      the
      fields,
      it
      pleaseth
      me
      well;
      but
      in
      respect
      it
      is
      not
      in
      the
      court,
      it
      is
      tedious.
      As
      it
      is
      a
      spare
      life,
      look
      you,
      it
      fits
      my
      humor
      well;
      but
      as
      there
      is
      no
      more
      plenty
      in
      it,
      it
      goes
      much
      against
      my
      stomach.
      Hast

      days
      was
      my
      wife
      a

      great;

      as
      his
      person's
      mighty,

      it
      be
      violent;
      and
      as
      he
      does
      conceive
      He
      is
      dishonored

      be
      beloved.
      Therefore,
      I
      pray
      you,
      As
      you
      have
      
e'er
      been
      my
      father's
      honored
      friend,
      When
      he
      shall
      miss
      me,
      (as,
      in
      faith,
      I
      mean
      not
      To
      see
      him
      any
      more,)
      cast
      your
      good
      counsels
      Upon
      his
      passion.
      Let

      fortune
   
      
      Where
      you'll
      be
      loath
      to
      be:
      Besides,
      you
      know,
      Prosperity's
      the
      very
      bond
      of
      love;
      Whose
      fresh
      complexion
      and
      whose
      heart
      together
   
      
      
         Do,
         as
         the
         Heavens
         have
         done;
      
      forget
      your
      evil:
      With
      them,
      forgive
      yourself.

      Verily,
      I
      swear,
      'tis
      better
      to
      be
      lowly
      born,
      And
      range
      with
      humble
      livers
      in
      content,
      Than
      to
      be
      perked
      up
      in
      a
      glistering
      grief,
   
      
      Old
      L.
      Beshrew
      me,
      I
      would,
      And
      venture
      maidenhead
      for't;
      and
      so
      would
      you,
      For
      all
      this
      spice
      of
      your
      hypocrisy.
      
         You,
         that
         have
         so
         fair
         parts
         of
         woman
         on
         you,
         Have
         too
         a
         woman's
         heart;
         which
         ever
         yet
         Affected
         eminence,
         wealth,
         sovereignty;
         Which,
         to
         say
         sooth,
         are
         blessings;
         and
         which
         gifts
         (Saving
         your
         mincing)
         the
         capacity
      
      Of
      your
      soft,
      cheveril
      conscience
      would
      receive,
      If
      you
      might
      please
      to
      stretch
      it.
   
      
         You,
         that
         have
         so
         fair
         parts
         of
         woman
         on
         you,
         Have
         too
         a
         woman's
         heart;
         which
         ever
         yet
         Affected
         eminence,
         wealth,
         sovereignty;
         Which,
         to
         say
         sooth,
         are
         blessings;
         and
         which
         gifts
         (Saving
         your
         mincing)
         the
         capacity
      
      
      Or
      made
      it
      not
      mine
      too?
      Or
      which
      of
      your
      friends
      Have
      I
      not
      strove
      to
      love,
      although
      I
      knew
      He
      were
      mine
      enemy?
      What
      friend
      of
      mine,
      That
      had
      to
      him
      derived
      your
      anger,
      did
      I
      Continue
      in
      my
      liking?
      nay,
      gave
      notice
      He
      was
      from
      thence
      discharged?
      Sir,
      call
      to
      mind
   
      
      To
      oppose
      your
      cunning.
      You
      are
      meek
      and
      humble
      mouthed;
      You
      sign
      your
      place
      and
      calling,
      in
      full
      seeming,
      With
      meekness
      and
      humility;
      but
      your
      heart
      Is
      crammed
      with
      arrogancy,
      spleen,
      and
      pride.
      You
      have,
      by
      fortune,
      and
      his
      highness'
      favors,
   
      
      I
      have
      more
      charity.
      But
      say,
      I
      warned
      ye;
      
         Take
         heed,
         for
         Heaven's
         sake,
         take
         heed,
         lest
         at
         once
         The
         burden
         of
         my
         sorrows
         fall
         upon
         ye.
      
   
      
         Take

      Make
      me
      a
      curse
      like
      this.

      we
      shall
      see
      him,
      For
      it,
      an
      archbishop.
   
      
      
         A
         
            spleeny
         
         Lutheran;

         A

         Lutheran;
      
      
            spleeny
         
      
      What
      sudden
      anger's
      this?
      how
      have
      I
      reaped
      it?
      He
      parted
      frowning
      from
      me,
      as
      if
      ruin
      Leaped
      from
      his
      eyes.
      So
      looks
      the
      chafed
      lion
      Upon
      the
      daring
      huntsman
      that
      has
      galled
      him;
      Then
      makes
      him
      nothing.
      I
      must
      read
      this
      paper;
      I
      fear,
      the
      story
      of
      his
      anger.
      'Tis
      so;
      This
      paper
      has
      undone
      me:â€”
      'Tis
      the
      account
      Of
      all
      that
      world
      of
      wealth
      I
      have
      drawn
      together
      For
      mine
      own
      ends;
      indeed,
      to
      gain
      the
      popedom,
      And
      fee
      my
      friends
      in
      Rome.
      O
      negligence,
      Fit
      for
      a
      fool
      to
      fall
      by!
      What
      cross
      devil
      Made
      me
      put
      this
      main
      secret
      in
      the
      packet
      I
      sent
      the
      king?
      Is
      there
      no
      way
      to
      cure
      this?
      No
      new
      device
      to
      beat
      this
      from
      his
      brains?
      I
      know
      'twill
      stir
      him
      strongly.
      Yet
      I
      know
      A
      way,
      if
      it
      take
      right,
      in
      spite
      of
      fortune,
      Will
      bring
      me
      off
      again.
      What's
      this?
      To
      the
      Pope!
      The
      letter,
      as
      I
      live,
      with
      all
      the
      business
      I
      writ
      to
      his
      holiness.
      Nay,
      then,
      farewell!
      I
      have
      touched
      the
      highest
      point
      of
      all
      my
      greatness;
      And,
      from
      that
      full
      meridian
      of
      my
      glory,
      I
      haste
      now
      to
      my
      setting.
      I
      shall
      fall
      Like
      a
      bright
      exhalation
      in
      the
      evening,
      And
      no
      man
      see
      me
      more.
   
      
      Of
      what
      
         coarse
         metal
      
      ye
      are
      moulded,
      â€”envy.
      How
      eagerly
      ye
      follow
      my
      disgraces,
      As
      if
      it
      fed
      ye!
      And
      how
      sleek
      and
      wanton
      Ye
      appear
      in
      every
      thing
      may
      bring
      my
      ruin!
      Follow
      your
      envious
      courses,
      men
      of
      malice;
      You
      have
      Christian
      warrant
      for
      them,
      and,
      no
      doubt,
      In
      time
      will
      find
      their
      fit
      rewards.
      That
      seal
   
      
         coarse
         metal
      
      
      Press
      not
      a
      falling
      man
      too
      far;
      'tis
      virtue:
      His
      faults
      lie
      open
      to
      the
      laws;
      let
      them,
      Not
      you,
      correct
      him.
      My
      heart
      weeps
      to
      see
      him
      So
      little
      of
      his
      great
      self.
   
      
      Cromwell,
      I
      charge
      thee,
      fling
      away
      ambition;
      By
      that
      sin
      fell
      the
      angels;
      how
      can
      man,
      then,
      The
      image
      of
      his
      Maker,
      hope
      to
      win
      by't?
      Love
      thyself
      last;
      cherish
      those
      hearts
      that
      hate
      thee;
      Corruption
      wins
      not
      more
      than
      honesty;
      Still
      in
      thy
      right
      hand
      carry
      gentle
      peace,
      To
      silence
      envious
      tongues.
      Be
      just,
      and
      fear
      not;
      Let
      all
      the
      ends
      thou
      aim'st
      at,
      be
      thy
      country's,
      Thy
      God's,
      and
      truth's;
      then
      if
      thou
      fall'st,
      O
      Cromwell
      Thou
      fall'st
      a
      blessed
      martyr.
      Serve
      the
      King:
      And,
      â€”Pr'ythee,
      lead
      me
      in:
      There
      take
      an
      inventory
      of
      all
      I
      have
      To
      the
      last
      penny:
      'tis
      the
      king's:
      my
      robe,
      And
      my
      integrity
      to
      Heaven,
      is
      all
      I
      dare
      now
      call
      mine
      own.
      O
      Cromwell,
      Cromwell,
      Had
      I
      but
      served
      my
      God
      with
      half
      the
      zeal
      I
      served
      my
      king,
      he
      would
      not
      in
      mine
      age
      Have
      left
      me
      naked
      to
      mine
      enemies.
      Crom.
      Good
      sir,
      have
      patience.
   
      
      Had
      the
      full
      view
      of,
      such
      a
      noise
      arose
      As
      the
      shrouds
      make
      at
      sea
      in
      a
      stiff
      tempest,
      As
      loud,
      and
      to
      as
      many
      tunes.
      Hats,
      cloaks,
      (Doublets,
      I
      think,)
      flew
      up;
      and
      had
      their
      faces
      Been
      loose,
      this
      day
      they
      had
      been
      lost.
      Such
      joy
   
      
      His
      blessed
      part
      to
      Heaven,
      and
      slept
      in
      peace.

      So
      may
      he
      rest;
      his
      faults
      lie
      gently

      The
      force
      of
      his
      own
      merit
      makes
      his

      It
      reaches
      far;
      and
      where
      'twill
      not

      Thither
      he

      Bosom
      up
      my
      counsel;
   
      
      Can
      advise
      me
      like
      you;
      be
      to
      yourself
      As
      you
      would
      to
      your
      friend.
   
      
      As
      give
      a
      crutch
      to
      the
      dead.
      But
      our
      count
      cardinal
   
      
      That
      virtue
      must
      go
      through.
      We
      must
      not
      stint
      Our
      necessary
      actions,
      in
      the
      fear
      To
      cope
      malicious
      censurers;
      which
      ever,
      As
      ravenous
      fishes,
      do
      a
      vessel
      follow
      That
      is
      new
      trimmed;
      but
      benefit
      no
      further
      Than
      vainly
      longing.
      What
      we
      oft
      do
      best,
      By
      sick
      interpreters,
      once
      weak
      ones,
      is
      Not
      ours,
      or
      not
      allowed;
      what
      worst,
      as
      oft,
      Hitting
      a
      grosser
      quality,
      is
      cried
      up
      For
      our
      best
      act.
      If
      We
      shall
      stand
      still,
      In
      fear
      our

      hear

         much
         pain
      
      
      
      we
      shall
      see
      him,
      For
      it,
      an
      archbishop.
   
      
      
         A
         
            spleeny
         
         Lutheran;
      
      and
      not
      wholesome
      to
   
      
         A
         
            spleeny
         
         Lutheran;
      
      
            spleeny
         
      
      What
      sudden
      anger's
      this?
      how
      have
      I
      reaped
      it?
      He
      parted
      frowning
      from
      me,
      as
      if
      ruin
      Leaped
      from
      his
      eyes.
      So
      looks
      the
      chafed
      lion
      Upon
      the
      daring
      huntsman
      that
      has
      galled
      him;
      Then
      makes
      him
      nothing.
      I
      must
      read
      this
      paper;
      I
      fear,
      the
      story
      of
      his
      anger.
      'Tis
      so;
      This
      paper
      has
      undone
      me:â€”
      'Tis
      the
      account
      Of
      all
      that
      world
      of
      wealth
      I
      have
      drawn
      together
      For
      mine
      own
      ends;
      indeed,
      to
      gain
      the
      popedom,
      And
      fee
      my
      friends
      in
      Rome.
      O
      negligence,
      Fit
      for
      a
      fool
      to
      fall
      by!
      What
      cross
      devil
      Made
      me
      put
      this
      main
      secret
      in
      the
      packet
      I
      sent
      the
      king?
      Is
      there
      no
      way
      to
      cure
      this?
      No
      new
      device
      to
      beat
      this
      from
      his
      brains?
      I
      know
      'twill
      stir
      him
      strongly.
      Yet
      I
      know
      A
      way,
      if
      it
      take
      right,
      in
      spite
      of
      fortune,
      Will
      bring
      me
      off
      again.
      What's
      this?
      To
      the
      Pope!
      The
      letter,
      as
      I
      live,
      with
      all
      the
      business
      I
      writ
      to
      his
      holiness.
      Nay,
      then,
      farewell!
      I
      have
      touched
      the
      highest
      point
      of
      all
      my
      greatness;
      And,
      from
      that
      full
      meridian
      of
      my
      glory,
      I
      haste
      now
      to
      my
      setting.
      I
      shall
      fall
      Like
      a
      bright
      exhalation
      in
      the
      evening,
      And
      no
      man
      see
      me
      more.

      moulded,
      â€”envy.
      How
      eagerly
      ye
      follow
      my
      disgraces,
      As

      Ye
      appear
      in
      every
      thing
      may
      bring
      my
      ruin!
      Follow
      your
      envious
      courses,
      men
      of
      malice;
      You
      have
      Christian
      warrant
      for
      them,
      and,
      no
      doubt,
      In
      time
      will
      find
      their
      fit
      rewards.

      Press
      not
      a
      falling
      man
      too
      far;
      'tis
      virtue:
      His
      faults

      open

      the

      let
      them,

      you,
      correct
      him.
      My
      heart
      weeps
      to
      see
      him
      So
      little
      of
      his
      great
      self.
   
      
      Cromwell,
      I
      charge
      thee,
      fling
      away
      ambition;
      By
      that
      sin
      fell
      the
      angels;
      how
      can
      man,
      then,
      The
      image
      of
      his
      Maker,
      hope
      to
      win
      by't?
      Love
      thyself
      last;
      cherish
      those
      hearts
      that
      hate
      thee;
      Corruption
      wins
      not
      more
      than
      honesty;
      Still
      in
      thy
      right
      hand
      carry
      gentle
      peace,
      To
      silence
      envious
      tongues.
      Be
      just,
      and
      fear
      not;
      Let
      all
      the
      ends
      thou
      aim'st
      at,
      be
      thy
      country's,
      Thy
      God's,
      and
      truth's;
      then
      if
      thou
      fall'st,
      O
      Cromwell
      Thou
      fall'st
      a
      blessed
      martyr.
      Serve
      the
      King:
      And,
      â€”Pr'ythee,
      lead
      me
      in:
      There
      take
      an

      of
      all
      I
      have
      To
      the
      last
      penny:
      'tis
      the
      king's:
      my
      robe,
      And
      my
      integrity
      to
      Heaven,
      is
      all
      I
      dare
      now
      call
      mine
      own.
      O
      Cromwell,
      Cromwell,
      Had
      I
      but
      served
      my
      God
      with
      half
      the
      zeal
      I
      served
      my
      king,
      he
      would
      not
      in
      mine
      age
      Have
      left
      me
      naked
      to
      mine
      enemies.

      he
      rest;

      Timon of Athens (V. 5 pp. 359-446)
      
      Poet.
      Sir,
      I
      have
      upon
      a
      high
      and
      pleasant
      hill,
      Feigned
      Fortune
      to
      be
      throned.
      The
      base
      o'
      the
      mount
      Is
      ranked
      with
      all
      deserts,
      all
      kind
      of
      natures,
   
      
      To
      propagate
      their
      states.
      Amongst
      them
      all,
      Whose
      eyes
      are
      on
      this
      sovereign
      lady
      fixed,
   
      
      Whom
      Fortune
      with
      her
      ivory
      hand
      wafts
      to
      her;
      Whose
      present
      grace
      to
      present
      slaves
      and
      servants
   
      
      Make
      sacred
      even
      his
      stirrup,
      and
      through
      him
      Drink
      the
      free
      air.
   
      
      'Tis
      not
      enough
      to
      help
      the
      feeble
      up,

      him
      after.â€”
      Fare
      you
      well.

      Why,
      this
      Is
      the
      world's
      soul;
   
      
      You
      must
      consider
      that
      a
      prodigal
      course
      Is
      like
      the
      sun's;
      but
      not,
      like
      his,
      recoverable.
   
      
      revenge
      enough.
      Who
      can
      speak
      broader
      than
      he
      that
      has
      no
      house
      to
      put
      his
      head
      in?
      Such
      may
      rail
      against
      great
      buildings.

      Timon of Athens (V. 5 pp. 359-446)
      
      Poet.
      Sir,
      I
      have
      upon
      a
      high
      and
      pleasant
      hill,
      Feigned
      Fortune
      to
      be
      throned.
      The
      base
      o'
      the
      mount
      Is
      ranked
      with
      all
      deserts,
      all
      kind
      of
      natures,
   
      
      To
      propagate
      their
      states.
      Amongst
      them
      all,
      Whose
      eyes
      are
      on
      this
      sovereign
      lady
      fixed,
   
      
      Whom
      Fortune
      with
      her
      ivory
      hand
      wafts
      to
      her;
      Whose
      present
      grace
      to
      present
      slaves
      and
      servants
   
      
      Make
      sacred
      even
      his
      stirrup,
      and
      through
      him
      Drink
      the
      free
      air.
   
      
      'Tis
      not
      enough

      Why,
      this
      Is
      the
      world's
      soul;
   
      
      You
      must
      consider
      that
      a
      prodigal
      course
      Is
      like
      the
      sun's;
      but
      not,
      like
      his,
      recoverable.
   
      
      revenge
      enough.
      Who
      can
      speak
      broader
      than
      he
      that
      has
      no
      house
      to
      put
      his
      head
      in?
      Such
      may
      rail
      against
      great
      buildings.

      brings

      Serv.
      I'
      the
      city
      of
      kites
      and
      crows?
      â€”What
      an
      ass
      it
      is!
      â€”Then
      thou
      dwellest
      with
      daws
      too?
   
      
      Bears
      a
      command
      in't;
      though
      thy
      tackle's
      torn,
   
      
      Cor.
      My
      name
      is
      Caius
      Marcius,
      who
      hath
      done
      To
      thee
      particularly,
      and
      to
      all
      the
      Volces,
      Great
      hurt
      and
      mischief;
      thereto
      witness
      may
      My
      surname,
      Coriolanus.
      The
      painful
      service,
      The
      extreme
      dangers,
      and
      the
      drops
      of
      blood
      Shed
      for
      my
      thankless
      country,
      are
      requited
      But
      with
      that
      surname;
      a
      good
      memory,
      And
      witness
      of
      the
      malice
      and
      displeasure
      Which
      thou
      shouldst
      hear
      me.
      Only
      that
      name
      remains;
      The
      cruelty
      and
      envy
      of
      the
      people,
      Permitted
      by
      our
      dastard
      nobles,
      who
      Have
      all
      forsook
      me,
      hath
      devoured
      the
      rest;
      And
      suffered
      me
      by
      the
      voice
      of
      slaves
      to
      be
      Whooped
      out
      of
      Rome.
      Now,
      this
      extremity
      Hath
      brought
      me
      to
      thy
      hearth;
      not
      out
      of
      hopeâ€”
      Mistake
      me
      not
      to
      save
      my
      life;
      for
      if
      I
      had
      feared
      death,
      of
      all
      the
      men
      i'
      the
      world
      I
      would
      have
      'voided
      thee;
      but
      in
      mere
      spite,
   
      
      Stand
      I
      before
      thee
      here.
      Then
      if
      thou
      hast
      A
      heart
      of
      wreak
      in
      thee,
      that
      will
      revenge
      Thine
      own
      particular
      wrongs,
      and
      stop
      those
      maims
      Of
      shame
      seen
      through
      thy
      country,
      speed
      thee
      straight,
      And
      make
      my
      misery
      serve
      thy
      turn;
      so
      use
      it,
      That
      my
      revengeful
      services
      may
      prove
      As
      benefits
      to
      thee;
      for
      I
      will
      fight
      Against
      my
      cankered
      country
      with
      the
      spleen
      Of
      all
      the
      under-fiends.
      But
      if
      so
      be
      Thou
      dar'st
      not
      this,
      and
      that
      to
      prove
      more
      fortunes
      Thou
      art
      tired,
      then,
      in
      a
      word,
      I
      also
      am
      Longer
      to
      live
      most
      weary,
      and
      present
      My
      throat
      to
      thee,
      and
      to
      thy
      ancient
      malice;
      Which
      not
      to
      cut,
      would
      show
      thee
      but
      a
      fool;
      Since
      I
      have
      ever
      followed
      thee
      with
      hate,
      Drawn
      tuns
      of
      blood
      out
      of
      thy
      country's
      breast,
      And
      cannot
      live
      but
      to
      thy
      shame,
      unless
      It
      be
      to
      do
      thee
      service.

      O

      Marcius,
      Each
      word
      thou
      hast
      spoke
      hath
      weeded
      from
      my
      heart
      A
      root
      of
      ancient
      envy.

      Should
      from

      O,
      let
      me
      twine

      against
      My
      grained
      ash
      an

      hath

      and
      do
      contest
      As
      hotly
      and
      as
      nobly
      with
      thy
      love,
      As
      ever
      in

      strength
      I
      did
      Contend
      against

      I

      my
      wedded

      Who
      deserves

      Deserves
      your

      your

      As
      hotly
      and
      as
      nobly
      with
      thy
      love,
      As
      ever
      in
      ambitious
      strength
      I
      did
      Contend
      against

      I

      Thou
      noble
      thing!

      Than
      when
      I
      first
      my
      wedded
      mistress
      saw
      Bestride
      my
      threshold.
      Why,
      thou
      Mars!
      I
      tell
      thee,
   
   
   
      Julius Caesar (V. 6 pp. 3-90)
      
      Caes.
      What
      say'st
      thou
      to
      me
      now?
      Speak
      once
      again.
      Sooth.
      Beware
      the
      ides
      of
      March.
   
      
      Merely
      upon
      myself.
      Vexed
      I
      am,
      Of
      late,
      with
      passions
      of
      some
      difference,
      
         Conceptions
         only
         proper
         to
         myself,
      
      Which
      give
      some
      soil,
      perhaps,
      to
      my
      behaviors;
      But
      let
      not
      therefore
      my
      good
      friends
      be
      grieved,
   
      
         Conceptions
         only
         proper
         to
         myself,
      
      
      Cas.
      Ay,
      do
      you
      fear
      it?
      Then
      must
      I
      think
      you
      would
      not
      have
      it
      so.
   
      
      I
      cannot
      tell
      what
      you
      and
      other
      men
      Think
      of
      this
      life;
      but,
      for
      my
      single
      self,
   
      
      he
      offered
      it
      the
      third
      time;
      he
      put
      it
      the
      third
      time
      by;
      .and
      still,
      as
      he
      refused
      it,
      the
      rabblement
      hooted,
      and
      clapped
      their
      chapped
      hands,
      and
      threw
      up
      their
      sweaty
      night-caps,
      and
      uttered
      such
      a
      deal
      of
      stinking
   
      
      Casca.
      I
      know
      not
      what
      you
      mean
      by
      that;
      but
      I
      am
      sure
      Caesar
      fell
      down.
      If
      the
      tag-rag
      people
      did
      not
      clap
      him
      and
      hiss
      him,
      according
      as
      he
      pleased
      and
      displeased
      them,
      as
      they
      use
      to
      do
      the
      players
      in
      the
      theatre,
      I
      am
      no
      true
      man.
   
      
      Cats.
      I
      know
      where
      I
      will
      wear
      this
      dagger
      then;
      Cassius
      from
      bondage
      will
      deliver
      Cassius:
      Therein,
      ye
      gods,
      you
      make
      the
      weak
      most
      strong;
      Therein,
      ye
      gods,
      you
      tyrants
      do
      defeat:
      Nor
      stony
      tower,
      nor
      walls
      of
      beaten
      brass,
      Nor
      airless
      dungeon,
      nor
      strong
      links
      of
      iron,
      Can
      be
      retentive
      to
      the
      strength
      of
      spirit;
      But
      life,
      being
      weary
      of
      these
      worldly
      bars,
      Never
      lacks
      power
      to
      dismiss
      itself.
      If
      I
      know
      this,
      know
      all
      the
      world
      besides,
   
      
      How
      that
      might
      change
      his
      nature,
      there's
      the
      question.
      It
      is
      the
      bright
      day
      that
      brings
      forth
      the
      adder;
   
      
      Between
      the
      acting
      of
      a
      dreadful
      thing
      And
      the
      first
      motion,
      all
      the
      interim
      is
      Like
      a
      phantasma,
      or
      a
      hideous
      dream:
      The
      genius,
      and
      the
      mortal
      instruments,
   
      
      Are
      then
      in
      council;
      and
      the
      state
      of
      man,
      Like
      to
      a
      little
      kingdom,
      suffers
      then
      The
      nature
      of
      an
      insurrection.

      thy
      mounstrous

      conspiracy
      Hide
      it
      in
      smiles,
      and
      affability;
   
      
      Did
      need
      an
      oath;
      when
      every
      drop
      of
      blood,
      That
      every
      Roman
      bears,
      and
      nobly
      bears,
      Is
      guilty
      of
      a
      several
      bastardy,
   
      
      O
      that
      we
      then
      could
      come
      by
      Caesar's
      spirit,
      And
      not
      dismember
      Caesar!
      But,
      alas,
      Caesar
      must
      bleed
      for
      it!
      And,
      gentle
      friends,
   
      
      For,
      he
      can
      do
      no
      more
      than
      Caesar's
      arm,
      When
      Caesar's
      head
      is
      off.

      then;
      Cassius
      from
      bondage
      will
      deliver
      Cassius:
      Therein,
      ye
      gods,
      you
      make
      the
      weak
      most
      strong;
      Therein,
      ye
      gods,
      you
      tyrants
      do
      defeat:
      Nor
      stony
      tower,
      nor
      walls
      of

      dungeon,

      strong
      links

      Can
      be
      retentive

      the
      strength
      of

      But
      life,
      being
      weary
      of
      these
      worldly
      bars,
      Never
      lacks

      How

      there's
      the
      question.
      It
      is
      the

      Between
      the

      of

      man,
      Like

      That
      every

      O

      we
      then
      could

      by
      Caesar's
      spirit,
      And
      not
      dismember
      Caesar!
      But,
      alas,
      Caesar
      must
      bleed
      for
      it!

      .Ay,

      Enthroned
      in
      the
      market-place,
      did
      sit
      alone,
      Whistling
      to
      the
      air;
      which,
      but
      for
      vacancy,
      Had
      gone
      to
      gaze
      on

      too,
      And
      made

      Therefore,
      O
      Antony,
      stay
      not
      by
      his

      Ham.
      A
      goodly
      one;
      in
      which
      there
      are
      many
      confines,
      wards,
      and
      dungeons;
      Denmark
      being
      one
      of
      the

            Ros.
            We
            think
            not
            so,
            my
            lord.
         
         
            Ham.
            Why,
            then
            'tis
            none
            to
            you;
            for
            there
            is
            nothing
            either
            good
            or
            bad,
            but
            thinking
            makes
            it
            so;
            to
            me
            it

         Ros.
         Why,
         then
         your
         ambition
         makes
         it
         one;
         'tis
      
      too
      narrow
      for
      your
      mind.
      Ham.
      O
      God!
      I
      could
      be
      bounded
      in
      a
      nutshell,
      and
      count
      myself
      a
      king
      of
      infinite
      space,
      were
      it
      not
      that
      I
      have
      bad
      dreams.
      Guil.
      Which
      dreams,
      indeed,
      are
      ambition;
      for
      the
      very
      substance
      of
      the
      ambitious
      is
      merely
      the
      shadow
      of
      a
      dream.
      Ham.
      A
      dream
      itself
      is
      but
      a
      shadow.
      Ros.
      Truly;
      and
      I
      hold
      ambition
      of
      so
      airy
      and
      light
      a
      quality,
      that
      it
      is
      but
      a
      shadow's
      shadow.
      Ham.
      Then
      are
      our
      beggars,
      bodies;
      and
      our
      monarchs,
      and
      outstretched
      heroes,
      the
      beggars'
      shadows.
      Shall
      we
      to
      the
      court?
      for,
      by
      my
      fay,
      I
      cannot
      reason.
      Ros.
      Guil.
      We'll
      wait
      upon
      you.
   
      
         
            Ros.
            We
            think
            not
            so,
            my
            lord.
         
         
            Ham.
            Why,
            then
            'tis
            none
            to
            you;
            for
            there
            is
            nothing
            either
            good
            or
            bad,
            but
            thinking
            makes
            it
            so;
            to
            me
            it
            is
            a
            prison.
         
         Ros.
         Why,
         then
         your
         ambition
         makes
         it
         one;
         'tis
      
      
            Ros.
            We
            think
            not
            so,
            my
            lord.
         
      
            Ham.
            Why,
            then
            'tis
            none
            to
            you;
            for
            there
            is
            nothing
            either
            good
            or
            bad,
            but
            thinking
            makes
            it
            so;
            to
            me
            it
            is
            a
            prison.
         
      
      But,
      what
      we
      do
      determine
      oft
      we
      break.
      Purpose
      is
      but
      the
      slave
      to
      memory;
      Of
      violent
      birth,
      but
      poor
      validity;
      Which
      now,
      like
      fruit
      unripe,
      sticks
      on
      the
      tree;
      But
      fall,
      unshaken,
      when
      they
      mellow
      be.
      Most
      necessary
      'tis,
      that
      we
      forget
      To
      pay
      ourselves
      what
      to
      ourselves
      is
      debt.
      What
      to
      ourselves
      in
      passion
      we
      propose,
   
      
      The
      poor
      advanced
      makes
      friends
      of
      enemies.
   
      
      For
      who
      not
      needs,
      shall
      never
      lack
      a
      friend;
   
      
      And
      who
      in
      want
      a
      hollow
      friend
      doth
      try,
      Directly
      seasons
      him
      his
      enemy.
   
      
      But,
      orderly
      to
      end
      where
      I
      begun,â€”
      Our
      wills
      and
      fates
      do
      so
      contrary
      run,
      That
      our
      devices
      still
      are
      overthrown;
      Our
      thoughts
      are
      ours,
      their
      ends
      none
      of
      our
      own.
      So
      think
      thou
      wilt
      no
      second
      husband
      wed;
      But
      die
      thy
      thoughts,
      when
      thy
      first
      lord
      is
      dead.
   
      
      For
      if
      the
      king
      like
      not
      the
      comedy,
      Why,
      then,
      belike,
      â€”he
      likes
      it
      not,
      perdy.

      what
      we

      determine
      oft
      we
      break.
      Purpose
      is
      but
      the
      slave
      to
      memory;
      Of
      violent
      birth,
      but
      poor
      validity;
      Which
      now,
      like
      fruit
      unripe,
      sticks
      on
      the

      But
      fall,
      unshaken,
      when
      they
      mellow
      be.
      Most
      necessary
      'tis,
      that
      we
      forget
      To
      pay
      ourselves
      what
      to
      ourselves
      is
      debt.
      What
      to
      ourselves
      in
      passion
      we
      propose,

      For
      who
      not
      needs,
      shall
      never
      lack
      a
      friend;
   
      
      And
      who
      in
      want
      a
      hollow
      friend
      doth
      try,
      Directly
      seasons
      him
      his
      enemy.
   
      
      But,
      orderly
      to
      end
      where
      I
      begun,â€”
      Our
      wills
      and

      do
      so
      contrary
      run,
      That
      our
      devices
      still
      are
      overthrown;
      Our
      thoughts
      are
      ours,
      their
      ends
      none
      of
      our
      own.
      So
      think
      thou
      wilt
      no
      second
      husband
      wed;
      But
      die
      thy

      when
      thy

      is

      hearkened
      to
      their
      father's
      testament.
      There
      was
   
      
      Unless
      you
      play
      the
      impious
      innocent,
   
      
      Cle.
      Thou
      art
      like
      the
      harpy,
      Which,
      to
      betray,
      doth
      with
      thine
      angel's
      face
      Seize
      with
      thine
      eagle's
      talons.
   
      
      No
      visor
      does
      become
      black
      villany,
      So
      well
      as
      soft
      and
      tender
      flattery.
