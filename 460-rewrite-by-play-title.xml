      cause,
      not
      we;
      For
      such
      as
      we
      are
      made
      of,
      such
      we
      be.
      How
      will
      this
      fadge?
      My
      master
      loves
      her
      dearly;
      And
      I,
      poor
      monster,
      fond
      as
      much
      on
      him;
      And
      she,
      mistaken,
      seems
      to
      dote
      on
      me:
   </p>
      <p>
      after
      midnight,
      is
      to
      be
      up

      surgere
   </p>
      <p>
      Clo.
      O
      mistress
      mine,
      where
      are
      you
      roaming?
      O,
      stay
      and
      hear;
      your
      true
      love's
      coming,
      That
      can
      sing
      both
      high
      and
      low:
      Trip
      no
      farther,
      pretty
      sweeting;
      Journeys
      end
      in
      lovers'
      meeting,
      Every
      wise
      man's
      son
      doth
      know.
   </p>
      <p>
      Clo.
      What
      is
      love?
      'tis
      not
      hereafter;
      Present
      mirth
      hath
      present
      laughter;
      What's
      to
      come
      is
      still
      unsure:
      In
      delay
      there
      lies
      no
      plenty;
      Then
      come
      kiss
      me,
      sweet-and-twenty,
      Youth's
      a
      stuff
      will
      not
      endure.
   </p>
      <p>
      than
      a
      steward?
      Dost
      thou
      think,
      because
      thou
      art
      virtuous,
      there
      shall
      be
      no
      more
      cakes
      and
      ale?
   </p>
      <p>
      since
      the
      youth
      of
      the
      count's
      was
      to-day
      with
      my
   </p>
      <p>
      Sir
      To.
      What,
      for
      being
      a
      Puritan?
      thy
      exquisite
   </p>
      <p>
      too
      late
      to
      go
      to
      bed
      now:
   </p>
      <p>
      An
      elder
      than
      herself;
      so
      wears
      she
      to
      him,
      So
      sways
      she
      level
      in
      her
      husband's
      heart.
      For,
      boy,
      however
      we
      do
      praise
      ourselves,
      Our
      fancies
      are
      more
      giddy
      and
      unfirm,
      More
      longing,
      wavering,
      sooner
      lost
      and
      worn
   </p>
      <p>
      The
      spinsters
      and
      the
      knitters
      in
      the
      sun,
      And
      the
      free
      maids
      that
      weave
      their
      thread
      with
      bones,
      Do
      use
      to
      chant
      it;
      it
      is
      silly
      sooth,
      And
      dallies
      with
      the
      innocence
      of
      love,
      Like
      the
      old
      age.

      Peace,

      There
      is
      example
      for't;
      the
      lady
      of
      the
      Strachy
      married
      the
      yeoman
      of

      Sir
      And.
      Fie
      on
      him,
      Jezebel!
      Fab.
      O,
      peace!
      now
      he's
      deeply
      in;
      look
      how
      imagination
      blows
      him.
      Mal.
      Having
      been
      three
      months
      married
      to
      her,
      sitting
      in
      my
      state,—
      Sir
      To.
      O,
      for
      a
      stone
      bow,
      to
      hit
      him
      in
      the
      eye!
      Mal.
      Calling
      my
      officers
      about
      me,
      in
      my
      branched
      velvet
      gown;
      having
      come
      from
      a
      day
      bed,
      where
      I
      left
      Olivia
      sleeping.
      Sir
      To.
      Fire
      and
      brimstone!
      Fab.
      O,
      peace,
      peace!
      Mal.
      And
      then
      to
      have
      the
      humor
      of
      state:
      and
      after
      a
      demure
      travel
      of
      regard,—
      telling
      them
      I
      know
      my
      place,
      as
      I
      would
      they
      should
      do
      theirs—
      to
      ask
      for
      my
      kinsman
      Toby:—
      Sir
      To.
      Bolts
      and
      shackles!
      Fab.
      O,
      peace,
      peace,
      peace!
      now,

      Shall
      this

      Mr.

      conjectures
      that
      this

      corruption
      of
      Stratici,

      By
      maidhood,
      honor,
      truth,
      and
      every
      thing,
      I
      love
      thee
      so,
      that,
      maugre
      all
      thy
      pride,
      Nor
      wit,
      nor

      can
      my
      passion
      hide.
      Do
      not
      extort
      thy
      reasons
      from
      this
      clause,
      For,
      that
      I
      woo,
      thou
      therefore
      hast
      no
      cause:
      But,
      rather,
      reason
      thus
      with
      reason
      fetter:
      Love
      sought
      is
      good,
      but
      given
      unsought,
      is
      better.

      Plague
      on't:
      an

      had
      been
      valiant
      and
      so
      cunning
      in
      fence,
      I'd
      have
      seen
      him
      damned
      ere
      I'd
      have
      challenged
      him.
      Let
      him
      let
      the
      matter
      slip,
      and
      I'll
      give
      him

      held
      in
      idle
      price
      to
      haunt

      youth,
      and

      and
      witless
      bravery
      keeps.
      I
      have
      delivered
      to
      lord
      Angelo
      (A
      man

      change

         And
         that
         thou
         oft
         provok'st;
         yet
         grossly
         fear'st
      
      
         Thy
         death,
         which
         is
         no
         more.
      
      Thou
      art
      not
      thyself;
      For
      thou
      exist'st
      on
      many
      a
      thousand
      grains
      That
      issue
      out
      of
      dust.
      Happy
      thou
      art
      not;
      For
      what
      thou
      hast
      not,
      still
      thou
      striv'st
      to
      get;
      And
      what
      thou
      hast,
      forget'st.
      Thou
      art
      not
      certain;
      For
      thy
      complexion
      shifts
      to
      strange
      affects,
      After
      the
      moon.
      If
      thou
      art
      rich,
      thou
      art
      poor;
   </p>
      <p>
         Of
         a
         poor
         worm.
         Thy
         best
         of
         rest
         is
         sleep,
         And
         that
         thou
         oft
         provok'st;
         yet
         grossly
         fear'st
      </p>
      <p>
         Thy
         death,
         which
         is
         no
         more.
      </p>
      <p>
      For,
      like
      an
      ass,
      whose
      back
      with
      ingots
      bows,
      Thou
      bear'st
      thy
      heavy
      riches
      but
      a
      journey,
      And
      death
      unloads
      thee.
      Friend
      hast
      thou
      none;
      For
      thine
      own
      bowels,
      which
      do
      call
      thee
      sire,
      The
      mere
      effusion
      of
      thy
      proper
      loins,
      Do
      curse
      the
      gout,
      serpigo,
      and
      the
      rheum,
      For
      ending
      thee
      no
      sooner.
      Thou
      hast
      nor
      youth"
      nor
      age;
      But,
      as
      it
      were,
      an
      after-dinner's
      sleep,
      Dreaming
      on
      both;
      for
      all
      thy
      blessed
      youth
      Becomes
      as
      aged,
      and
      doth
      beg
      the
      alms
      Of
      palsied
      eld;
      and
      when
      thou
      art
      old,
      and
      rich,
      Thou
      hast
      neither
      heat,
      affection,
      limb,
      nor
      beauty,
      To
      make
      thy
      riches
      pleasant.
      What's
      yet
      in
      this
      That
      bears
      the
      name
      of
      life?
      Yet
      in
      this
      life
      Lie
      hid
      more
      thousand
      deaths;
      yet
      death
      we
      fear,
      That
      makes
      these
      odds
      all
      even.
      Claud.
      I
      humbly
      thank
      you.
      To
      sue

      I
      find,
      I
      seek
      to
      die:
      And

      find
      life:

         The
         sense

         is
         most
         in
         apprehension;
      
      And
      the
      poor
      beetle,
      that
      we
      tread
      upon,
      In
      corporal
      sufferance
      finds
      a
      pang
      as
      great

      O,
      death's
      a

      disguiser:
      and
      you
      may
   </p>
      <p>
      Abhor.
      Sirrah,
      bring
      Barnardine
      hither.
      Clo.
      Master
      Barnardine!
      You
      must
      rise
      and
      be
      hanged,
      master
      Barnardine!
      Abhor.
      What,
      ho,
      Barnardine!
      Barnar.
      [Within.]
      A
      pox
      o'
      your
      throats!
      Who
      makes
      that
      noise
      there?
      What
      are
      you?
      Clo.
      Your
      friends,
      sir;
      the
      hangman:
      you
      must
      be
      so
      good,
      sir,
      to
      rise
      and
      be
      put
      to
      death.
      Barnar.
      [Within.]
      Away,
      you
      rogue,
      away;
      I
      am
      sleepy.
      Abhor.
      Tell
      him,
      he
      must
      awake,
      and
      that
      quickly
      too.
      Clo.
      Pray,
      master
      Barnardine,
      awake
      till
      you
      are
      executed,
      and
      sleep
      afterwards.
      Abhor.
      Go
      in
      to
      him,
      and
      fetch
      him
      out.
      Clo.
      He
      is
      coming,
      sir,
      he
      is
      coming;
      I

      his
      straw
      rustle.

      <p>
      Clo.
      O,
      the
      better,
      sir;
      for
      he
      that
      drinks
      all
      night,
      and
      is
      hanged
      betimes
      in
      the
      morning,
      may
      sleep
      the
      sounder
      all
      the
      next
      day.

      This
      nor

      a
      jot:
   </p>
      <p>
      For
      my
      authority
      bears

      That
      no
      particular
      scandal
      once
      can
      touch,
      But
      it
      confounds
      the
      breather.
      He
      should
      have
      lived,
      Save
      that

      Away
      with
      her:
      —poor

      She

      O

      I
      conjure
      thee,
      as
      thou
      believest
      There
      is
      another
      comfort
      than
      this
      world,
      That
      thou
      neglect
      me
      not,
      with
      that
      opinion
      
         That
         I
         am
         touched
         with
         madness:
      
      make
      not
      impossible
      That
      which
      but
      seems
      unlike:
      'tis
      not
      impossible
   </p>
      <p>
         That
         I

         with
         madness:

      <p>
      But
      one,
      the
      wicked'st
      caitiff
      on
      the
      ground,
      May
      seem
      as
      shy,
      as
      grave,
      as
      just,
      as
      absolute,
      As
      Angelo;
      even
      so
      may
      Angelo,
   </p>
      <p>
      To
      speak
      before
      your
      time.
      —Proceed.
      Isab.
      I
      went
      To
      this
      pernicious
      caitiff
      deputy.
   </p>
      <p>
      That's
      somewhat
      madly
      spoken.

      O,
      that
      it
      were
      as
      like
      as
      it
      is
      true!
   </p>
      <p>
      Where
      I
      have
      seen
      corruption
      boil
      and
      bubble,
      Till
      it
      o'errun
      the
      stew;
      laws,
      for
      all
      faults;
      But
      faults
      so
      countenanced,
      that
      the
      strong
      statutes
      Stand
      like
      the
      forfeits
      in
      a
      barber's
      shop,
      As
      much
      in
      mock
      as
      mark.
   </p>
      <p>
      Which
      I
      did
      think
      with
      slower
      foot
      came
      on,
      That
      brained
      my
      purpose:
      but
      peace
      be
      with
      him!
      That
      life
      is
      better
      life,
      past
      fearing
      death,
      Than
      that
      which
      lives
      to
      fear:
      make
      it
      your
      comfort,
      So
      happy
      is
      your
      brother.
   </p>
      <p>
      Sweet
      Isabel,
      do
      yet
      but
      kneel
      by
      me;
      Hold
      up
      your
      hands;
      say
      nothing;
      I'll
      speak
      all.
      They
      say,
      best
      men
      are
      moulded
      out
      of
      faults;
      And,
      for
      the
      most,
      become
      much
      more

      but
      justice,
      In
      that
      he
      did
      the
      thing
      for
      which
      he
      died:
      For
      Angelo,
      His
      act
      did
      not
      o'ertake
      his
      bad
      intent;
      And
      must
      be
      buried
      but
      as
      an
      intent
      That
      perished
      by
      the

      thoughts

      merely

      a
      moral
      medicine
      to
      a
      mortifying
      mischief.
      I
      cannot
      hide
      what
      I
      am:
      I
      must
      be
      sad
      when
      I
      have
      cause,
      and
      smile
      at
      no
      man's
      jests;
      eat
      when
      I
      have
      stomach,
      and
      wait
      for
      no

      my

      with
      the
      ears
      of
      Claudio.—
      'Tis
      certain
      so;
      —the
      prince
      wooes
      for
      himself.

      is
      constant
      in

      things,
      Save
      in
      the
      office
      and
      affairs
      of
      love:
      Therefore,
      all
      hearts
      in
      love
      use
      their
      own
      tongues;
      Let
      every
      eye
      negotiate
      for
      itself,
      And
      trust
      no

      Against
      whose
      charms
      faith
      melteth
      into
      blood.
      This
      is
      an

      of
      hourly

      It

      the

      O
      God
      of
      love!
      I
      know,
      he
      doth

      As
      much
      as
      may
      be
      yielded
      to
      a
      man;
      But
      nature
      never
      framed
      a
      woman's
      heart
      Of
      prouder
      stuff
      than
      that
      of
      Beatrice.
      Disdain
      and
      scorn
      ride
      sparkling
      in
      her
      eyes,
      Misprising
      what
      they
      look
      on;
      and
      her

      highly,
      that
      to
      her
      All
      matter
      else
      seems
      weak.
      She
      cannot
      love,
      Nor
      take
      no
      shape
      nor
      project

      Give
      not
      this
      rotten
      orange
      to
      your
      friend:
      She's
      but
      the
      sign
      and
      semblance
      of
      her
      honor.
      Behold,
      how
      like
      a
      maid
      she
      blushes
      here.
      O,
      what
      authority
      and
      show
      of
      truth
      Can
      cunning
      sin
      cover
      itself
      withal!
      Comes
      not
      that
      blood,
      as
      modest
      evidence,
      To
      witness
      simple
      virtue?
      Would
      you
      not
      swear,
      All
      you
      that
      see
      her,
      that
      she
      were
      a
      maid,
      By
      these
      exterior
      shows?—
      But
      she
      is
      none.
      She
      knows
      the
      heat
      of
      a
      luxurious
      bed;
      Her
      blush
      is
      guiltiness,
      not
      modesty.
   </p>
      <p>
      Shall

      lamented,
      pitied,
      and

      hearer;
      for
      it
      so
      falls
      out,
      That
      what
      we
      have,
      we
      prize
      not
      to
      the
      worth,
      Whiles
      we
      enjoy
      it;
      but
      being
      lacked
      and
      lost,
      Why,
      then
      we
      rack
      the
      value;
      then
      we
      find
      The
      virtue,
      that
      possession
      would
      not
      show
      us
   </p>
      <p>
      Nor
      let
      no
      comforter
      delight
      mine
      ear,
      But
      such
      a
      one
      whose
      wrongs
      do
      suit
      with
      mine.
      Bring
      me
      a
      father,
      that
      so
      loved
      his
      child,
      Whose
      joy
      of
      her
      is
      overwhelmed
      like
      mine,
      And
      bid
      him
      speak
      of
      patience;
      Measure
      his
      woe
      the
      length
      and
      breadth
      of
      mine,
      And
      let
      it

         not
         strike
         me.
         
            You,
            perhaps,
            may
            think,

            myself,
            That

         again.

         Good
         Hermia,
         do
         not
         be
         so
         bitter
         with
         me.
         I
         evermore
         did
         love
         you,
         Hermia,
         Did
         ever
         keep
         your
         counsels,
         never
         wronged

         that,
         in
         love
         unto
         Demetrius,
         I
         told
         him

         your
         stealth
         unto
         this

         for
         love,
         I
         followed
         him.

         hath
         chid
         me
         hence,
         and
         threatened

         strike
         me,
         spurn
         me,

         to
         kill
         me
         too:
         And
         now,
         so
         you

         quiet
         go,

         will
         I
         bear
         my

         back,
         And
         follow
         you
         no
         farther.
         Let

         Why,

            O,
            when
            she's
            angry,
            she
            is
            keen

            shrewd.
            
               She

               when
               she

            You,
            perhaps,
            may
            think,
            Because
            she's
            something
            lower
            than
            myself,
            That

            her.

         Hark,

         Hel.
         Good
         Hermia,
         do
         not
         be
         so
         bitter
         with
         me.
         I
         evermore
         did
         love
         you,
         Hermia,
         Did
         ever
         keep
         your
         counsels,
         never
         wronged
         you;
         Save
         that,
         in
         love
         unto
         Demetrius,
         I
         told
         him
         of
         your
         stealth
         unto
         this
         wood.
         He
         followed
         you;
         for
         love,
         I
         followed
         him.
         But
         he
         hath
         chid
         me
         hence,
         and
         threatened
         me
         To
         strike
         me,
         spurn
         me,
         nay,
         to
         kill
         me
         too:
         And
         now,
         so
         you
         will
         let
         me
         quiet
         go,
         To
         Athens
         will
         I
         bear
         my

         back,
         And
         follow

         no
         farther.
         Let
         me
         go:
         You
         see
         how
         simple
         and
         how

      a
      good

      is
      a
      shepherd's
      life,
      it
      is
      naught.
      In
      respect
      that
      it
      is
      solitary,
      I
      like

      in

      private,
      it
      is
      a
      very
      vile
      life.
      Now,
      in

      in
      the

      in
      respect
      it
      is
      not
      in
      the
      court,
      it
      is
      tedious.
      As
      it
      is
      a
      spare
      life,
      look
      you,
      it

      it

      I

      I
      fear,
      the
      story
      of
      his

      'Tis

      This

      Nay,
      then,
      farewell!
      I

      touched
      the
      highest
      point
      of
      all

      And,
      from
      that
      full
      meridian
      of
      my
      glory,
      I
      haste
      now
      to
      my
      setting.
      I
      shall
      fall
      Like
      a
      bright
      exhalation
      in
      the
      evening,
      And

      carry
      gentle
      peace,
      To

      Be

      fear
      not;
      Let
      all

      sun's
      a
      thief,
      and
      with
      his
      great
      attraction
      Robs
      the
      vast
      sea;
      the
      moon's
      an
      arrant
      thief,
      And
      her
      pale
      fire
      she
      snatches
      from
      the
      sun;
      The
      sea's
      a
      thief,
      whose
      liquid
      surge
      resolves
      The
      moon
      into
      salt
      tears;
      the
      earth's
      a
      thief,
      That
      feeds
      and
      breeds
      by
      a
      composture
      stolen
      From
      general
      excrement;
      each
      thing's
      a
      thief;
      The
      laws,
      your
      curb
      and
      whip,
      in
      their
      rough
      power

      <p>
      But
      thieves
      do
      lose
      it.
      Steal
      not
      less,
      for
      this

      <p>
      o'
      the
      time:
      it
      opens
      the
      eyes
      of
      expectation;
      performance
      is
      ever
      the
      duller
      for
      his
      act;
      and,
      but
      in
      the
      plainer
      and
      simpler
      kind
      of
      people,
      the
      deed
      of
      saying
      is
      quite
      out
      of
      use.
      To
      promise
      is
      most
      courtly
      and
      fashionable;
      performance
      is
      a
      kind
      of
      will
      or
      testament,
      which
      argues
      a
      great
      sickness
      in
      his
      judgment
      that
      makes
      it.

      hath
      done
      To
      thee
      particularly,
      and
      to
      all
      the
      Volces,
      Great
      hurt

      mischief;
      thereto
      witness
      may
      My
      surname,
      Coriolanus.
      The
      painful
      service,
      The
      extreme
      dangers,
      and
      the
      drops
      of
      blood
      Shed

      my
      thankless
      country,
      are
      requited
      But
      with
      that
      surname;
      a
      good
      memory,
      And
      witness
      of
      the
      malice
      and
      displeasure
      Which
      thou
      shouldst
      hear
      me.
      Only
      that
      name
      remains;
      The
      cruelty
      and
      envy
      of
      the
      people,
      Permitted
      by
      our
      dastard
      nobles,
      who
      Have
      all
      forsook
      me,
      hath
      devoured
      the
      rest;
      And
      suffered
      me
      by
      the
      voice
      of
      slaves
      to
      be
      Whooped
      out
      of
      Rome.
      Now,
      this
      extremity
      Hath
      brought
      me
      to
      thy
      hearth;
      not
      out
      of
      hope—
      Mistake
      me
      not
      to
      save
      my
      life;
      for
      if
      I
      had
      feared
      death,
      of
      all
      the
      men
      i'
      the
      world
      I
      would
      have
      'voided
      thee;
      but
      in
      mere
      spite,
   </p>
      <p>
      Stand
      I
      before
      thee
      here.
      Then
      if
      thou
      hast
      A
      heart
      of
      wreak
      in
      thee,
      that
      will
      revenge
      Thine
      own
      particular
      wrongs,
      and
      stop
      those
      maims
      Of
      shame
      seen
      through
      thy
      country,
      speed
      thee
      straight,
      And
      make
      my
      misery
      serve
      thy
      turn;
      so
      use
      it,
      That
      my
      revengeful
      services
      may
      prove
      As
      benefits
      to
      thee;
      for
      I
      will
      fight
      Against
      my
      cankered
      country
      with
      the
      spleen
      Of
      all
      the
      under-fiends.
      But
      if
      so
      be
      Thou
      dar'st
      not
      this,
      and
      that
      to
      prove
      more
      fortunes
      Thou
      art
      tired,
      then,
      in
      a
      word,
      I
      also
      am
      Longer
      to
      live
      most
      weary,
      and
      present
      My
      throat
      to
      thee,
      and
      to
      thy
      ancient
      malice;
      Which
      not
      to
      cut,
      would
      show
      thee
      but
      a
      fool;
      Since
      I
      have
      ever
      followed
      thee
      with
      hate,
      Drawn
      tuns
      of
      blood
      out
      of
      thy
      country's
      breast,
      And
      cannot
      live
      but
      to
      thy
      shame,
      unless
      It
      be
      to
      do
      thee
      service.
      Auf.
      O
      Marcius,
      Marcius,
      Each
      word
      thou
      hast
      spoke
      hath
      weeded
      from
      my
      heart
      A
      root
      of
      ancient
      envy.
      If
      Jupiter
      Should
      from
      yon
      cloud
      speak
      divine
      things,
      and
      say,
      'Tis

      O,
      let
      me
      twine
      Mine
      arms
      about
      that
      body,
      where
      against
      My
      grained
      ash
      an
      hundred
      times
      hath
      broke,
      And
      scarred
      the
      moon
      with
      splinters!
      Here
      I
      clip
      The
      anvil
      of
      my
      sword;
      and
      do
      contest
      As
      hotly
      and
      as
      nobly
      with
      thy
      love,
      As
      ever
      in
      ambitious
      strength
      I
      did
      Contend
      against
      thy
      valor.
      Know
      thou
      first,
      I

      the

      noble

      more

      my

      mistress
      saw
      Bestride
      my

      you
      tyrants
      do
      defeat:
      Nor
      stony
      tower,
      nor
      walls
      of
      beaten
      brass,
      Nor
      airless
      dungeon,
      nor
      strong
      links
      of
      iron,
      Can
      be
      retentive
      to
      the
      strength
      of
      spirit;
      But
      life,
      being
      weary
      of
      these
      worldly
      bars,
      Never
      lacks
      power
      to
      dismiss
      itself.
      If
      I
      know
      this,
      know
      all
      the
      world
      besides,

      <p>
      How
      that
      might
      change
      his
      nature,
      there's
      the
      question.
      It
      is
      the
      bright
      day
      that
      brings
      forth
      the
      adder;
   </p>
      <p>
      Between
      the
      acting
      of
      a
      dreadful
      thing
      And
      the
      first
      motion,
      all
      the
      interim
      is
      Like
      a
      phantasma,
      or
      a
      hideous
      dream:
      The
      genius,
      and
      the
      mortal
      instruments,
   </p>
      <p>
      Are
      then
      in
      council;
      and
      the
      state
      of
      man,
      Like
      to
      a
      little
      kingdom,
      suffers
      then
      The
      nature
      of
      an
      insurrection.
   </p>
      <p>
      To
      mask
      thy
      mounstrous
      visage?
      Seek
      none,
      conspiracy
      Hide
      it
      in
      smiles,
      and
      affability;
   </p>
      <p>
      Did
      need
      an
      oath;
      when
      every
      drop
      of
      blood,
      That
      every
      Roman
      bears,
      and
      nobly
      bears,
      Is
      guilty
      of
      a
      several
      bastardy,
   </p>
      <p>
      O
      that
      we
      then
      could
      come
      by
      Caesar's
      spirit,
      And
      not
      dismember
      Caesar!
      But,
      alas,
      Caesar
      must
      bleed
      for
      it!
      And,
      gentle
      friends,
   </p>
      <p>
      For,
      he
      can
      do
      no
      more
      than
      Caesar's
      arm,
      When
      Caesar's
      head
      is
      off.

      .Ay,
      sir;
      We
      did
      sleep
      day
      out
      of
      countenance,
      and
      made

      Wild-boars

      whole

      and
      but
      twelve
      persons
      there.
      Is
      this
      true?

      Her
      people
      out
      upon
      her;
      and
      Antony,
      Enthroned
      in
      the
      market-place,
      did
      sit
      alone,
      Whistling
      to
      the
      air;
      which,
      but
      for
      vacancy,
      Had
      gone
      to
      gaze
      on
      Cleopatra
      too,
      And
      made
      a
      gap
      in
      nature.
   </p>
      <p>
      Therefore,
      O
      Antony,
      stay
      not
      by
      his
      side.
      Thy
      demon,
      that's
      thy
      spirit
      which
      keeps
      thee,
      is
      Noble,
      courageous,
      high,
      unmatchable,
      Where
      Caesar's
      is
      not;
      but
      near
      him,
      thy
      angel
      Becomes
      a
      Fear,
      as
      being
      overpowered:
      therefore
      Make
      space
      enough

      sad,
      Nor
      make
      replies
      of
      loathness.

      tell
      the
      secrets
      of
      my

      I
      could
      a

      whose

      harrow
      up
      thy

      freeze
      thy

      Make
      thy
      two
      eyes,
      like
      stars,

      from
      their

      Then
      is
      the
      world

      Ham.
      A
      goodly
      one;
      in
      which
      there
      are
      many
      confines,
      wards,
      and
      dungeons;
      Denmark
      being
      one
      of
      the
      worst.
      
         
            Ros.
            We
            think
            not
            so,
            my
            lord.
         
         
            Ham.
            Why,
            then
            'tis
            none
            to
            you;
            for
            there
            is
            nothing
            either
            good
            or
            bad,
            but
            thinking
            makes
            it
            so;
            to
            me
            it
            is
            a
            prison.
         
         Ros.
         Why,
         then
         your
         ambition
         makes
         it
         one;
         'tis
      
      too
      narrow
      for
      your
      mind.
      Ham.
      O
      God!
      I
      could
      be
      bounded
      in
      a
      nutshell,
      and
      count
      myself
      a
      king
      of
      infinite
      space,
      were
      it
      not
      that
      I
      have
      bad
      dreams.
      Guil.
      Which
      dreams,
      indeed,
      are
      ambition;
      for
      the
      very
      substance
      of
      the
      ambitious
      is
      merely
      the
      shadow
      of
      a
      dream.
      Ham.
      A
      dream
      itself
      is
      but
      a
      shadow.
      Ros.
      Truly;
      and
      I
      hold
      ambition
      of
      so
      airy
      and
      light
      a
      quality,
      that
      it
      is
      but
      a
      shadow's
      shadow.
      Ham.
      Then
      are
      our
      beggars,
      bodies;
      and
      our
      monarchs,
      and
      outstretched
      heroes,
      the
      beggars'
      shadows.
      Shall
      we
      to
      the
      court?
      for,
      by
      my
      fay,
      I
      cannot
      reason.
      Ros.
      Guil.
      We'll
      wait
      upon
      you.
   </p>
      <p>
         
            Ros.
            We
            think
            not
            so,
            my
            lord.
         
         
            Ham.
            Why,
            then
            'tis
            none
            to
            you;
            for
            there
            is
            nothing
            either
            good
            or
            bad,
            but
            thinking
            makes
            it
            so;
            to
            me
            it
            is
            a
            prison.
         
         Ros.
         Why,
         then
         your
         ambition
         makes
         it
         one;
         'tis
      </p>
      <p>
            Ros.
            We
            think
            not
            so,
            my
            lord.
         </p>
      <p>
            Ham.
            Why,
            then
            'tis
            none
            to
            you;
            for
            there
            is
            nothing
            either
            good
            or
            bad,
            but
            thinking
            makes
            it
            so;
            to
            me
            it
            is
            a
            prison.
         </p>
      <p>
      But,
      what
      we
      do
      determine
      oft
      we
      break.
      Purpose
      is
      but
      the
      slave
      to
      memory;
      Of
      violent
      birth,
      but
      poor
      validity;
      Which
      now,
      like
      fruit
      unripe,
      sticks
      on
      the
      tree;
      But
      fall,
      unshaken,
      when
      they
      mellow
      be.
      Most
      necessary
      'tis,
      that
      we
      forget
      To
      pay
      ourselves
      what
      to
      ourselves
      is
      debt.
      What
      to
      ourselves
      in
      passion
      we
      propose,
   </p>
      <p>
      The
      poor
      advanced
      makes
      friends
      of
      enemies.
   </p>
      <p>
      For
      who
      not
      needs,
      shall
      never
      lack
      a
      friend;
   </p>
      <p>
      And
      who
      in
      want
      a
      hollow
      friend
      doth
      try,
      Directly
      seasons
      him
      his
      enemy.
   </p>
      <p>
      But,
      orderly
      to
      end
      where
      I
      begun,—
      Our
      wills
      and
      fates
      do
      so
      contrary
      run,
      That
      our
      devices
      still
      are
      overthrown;
      Our
      thoughts
      are
      ours,
      their
      ends
      none
      of
      our
      own.
      So
      think
      thou
      wilt
      no
      second
      husband
      wed;
      But
      die
      thy
      thoughts,
      when
      thy
      first
      lord
      is
      dead.
   </p>
      <p>
      For
      if
      the
      king
      like
      not
      the
      comedy,
      Why,
      then,
      belike,
      —he
      likes
      it
      not,
      perdy.
