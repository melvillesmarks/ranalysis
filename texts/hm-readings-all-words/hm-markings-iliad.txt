   
      Flow
      in
      thy
      nerves,
      God
      gave
      thee
      it;
      and
      so
      'tis
      not
      thine
      own,
      But
      in
      his
      hands
      still.
      What
      then
      lifts
      thy
      pride
      in
      this
      so
      high?
   
   
      Bristled
      his
      bosom,
      and
      two
      ways
      drew
      his
      discursive
      part;
      If,
      from
      his
      thigh
      his
      sharp
      sword
      drawn,
      he
      should
      make
      room
      about
      Atrides'
      person,
      slaught'ring
      him,
      or
      sit
      his
      anger
      out,
      And
      curb
      his
      spirit.
      While
      these
      thoughts
      striv'd
      in
      his
      blood
      and
      mind,
   
   
      Achilles
      by
      the
      yellow
      curls,
      and
      only
      gave
      her
      look
      To
      him;
      appearance
      not
      a
      man
      of
      all
      the
      rest
      could
      see.
   
   
      Stand
      heartily
      inclin'd
      to
      both.
      Come,
      give
      us
      both
      respects,
      And
      cease
      contention;
      
         draw
         no
         sword;
         use
         words,
      
      and
      such
      as
      may
   
   
      Be
      bitter
      to
      his
      pride,
      but
      just;
   
   
      So
      old
      as
      I.
      I
      liv'd
      long
      since,
      and
      was
      companion
      With
      men
      superior
      to
      you
      both,
      who
      yet
      would
      ever
      hear
      My
      counsels
      with
      respect.
      Mine
      eyes
      yet
      never
      witness
      were,
      Nor
      ever
      will
      be,
      of
      such
      men
      as
      then
      delighted
      them;

      Exadius,
      and
      god-
      Polypheme,
      Caneus,
      and
      Dryas
      prince
      of

      Theseus,
      A

      heaven's
      immortals
      form'd;
      all,
      all
      most
      vigorous,
   
   
      Since
      they
      mine
      honour.
      But
      your
      king,
      in
      tempting
      mischief,
      raves,
      Nor
      sees
      at
      once
      by
      present
      things
      the
      future;
      how
      
      waves
      Ills
      follow
      ills;
      injustices
      being
      never

      after-plagues
      even
      then

      seen
      as
      sure;
      Which
      yet
      he
      sees
      not,
      and
      so
      soothes
      his
      present
      lust,
      which
      check'd,
      Would
      check
      plagues
      future;

      succouring
      right,
      protect
   
   
      Made
      to
      his
      mother:
      "Mother!
      Since
      you

      me
      forth
      to
      breathe
      So
      short
      a

      Olympius

      his

      sate
      by

      said:
   
   
      Her

      she
      pour'd
      out
      in
      tears:
      "O

      my

      said
      she,
      "Why
      brought
      I
      up
      thy
      being
      at
      all,
      that

      without

      And
      tears
      perform

      But
      to

      thrall
      to
      so
      stern
      a

      As

      But
      what
      thou
      wishest
      now,
      If
      Jove
      will
      grant,
      I'll
      up
      and
      ask;
      Olympus
      crown'd
      with

      And
      hurl'd
      me
      out
      of
      heaven.
      All
      day
      I
      was
      in
      falling
      down;
      At
      length
      in
      Lemnos
      I
      struck
      earth.
      The

      And
      I,
      together,
      set;
      my
      life
      almost
      set
      too;
      yet
      there
      The
      Sintii
      cheer'd
      and
      took

      This
      did

      laughter
      cheer
   
   
      Nectar
      to
      all
      the
      other
      Gods.
      A
      laughter
      never
      left
      Shook
      all
      the
      blessed
      deities,
      to
      see
      the
      lame
      so
      deft
   
   
      the

      rapture
      is

      of

      to
      dissent,
      of

      or
      singularity)
      I
      am
      bound,
      by
      this
      brief
      comment,
      to
      show
      I
      understand
      how
      all
      other

      characters,
      which
      not
      understood,
      how
      are
      their
      speeches,
      being
      one
      by
      another
      as
      conveniently
      and
      necessarily
      known
      as
      the
      instrument
      by
      the
      sound?
      If
      a
      translator
      or
      interpreter
      of
      a
      ridiculous
      and
      cowardly-described
      person
      (being
      deceived
      in
      his
      character)
      so
   
   
      dream,
      and
      dreaming
      still,
      awake,
   
   
      Swarms
      rise
      out
      of
      a
      hollow
      rock,
      repairing
      the
      degrees
      Of
      their
      egression
      endlessly,
      with
      ever
      rising
      new
      From
      forth
      their
      sweet
      nest;
      as
      their
      store,
      still
      as
      it
      faded,
      grew,
      And
      never
      would
      cease
      sending
      forth
      her
      clusters
      to
      the
      spring,
      They
      still
      crowd
      out
      so;
      this
      flock
      here,
      that
      there,
      belabouring
      The
      loaded
      flowers;
      so
      from
      the
      ships
      and
      tents
      the
      army's
      store
      Troop'd
      to
      these
      princes,
      and
      the
      court,
      along
      th'
      unmeasur'd
      shore;
      Amongst
      whom,
      Jove's
      ambassadress,
      Fame,
      in
      her
      virtue
      shin'd,

      footsteps
      from
      so
      many
      towns;
      
         
         because
         his
         power
         is
         most,
         He
         will
         destroy
         most.
      
      But
      how
      vile
      such
      and
      so
      great
      an
      host
   
   
      But
      Jove
      hath
      
         
         order'd
         I
         should
         grieve,
         and
         to
         that
         end
         hath
         cast
         My

         past
         end.
      
      Myself,
      and
      Thetis'
      son,
   
   
      
      Jove
      heard
      him
      not,
      but
      made
      more
      plentiful
      the
      birth
      Of
      his
      sad
      toils,
      yet
      took
      his
      gifts.

      being

      laid
      by
      a
      man,
      that
      which
      he
      addeth
      is
      only
      
         the
         work
         of
         a
         woman,

         netify

      breath
      In
      strength
      of
      far-resounding
      blows,
   
   
      Then
      (seeing
      Ulysses
      next)
      he
      said:
      "Lov'd
      daughter,
      what
      is
      he
      That,
      lower
      than

      in
      his
      shoulders
      and
      big

      presents
      a
      broader
      show?
      His
      armour
      lies
      upon
      the
      earth;
      he
      up
      and
      down
      doth

      their
      arms,
      If,
      in
      this
      truce,
      they
      should
      be
      tried

      For
      when
      the
      Trojan
      council
      met,
      and
      these
      together
      
         stood

         set,
      
      Ulysses
      did
      
         exceed,

      bred

      If

      years
      now
      give
      me;
      and
      now
      years
      want
      that
      main
      strength
      of

      But
      show'd

      a

      Rude
      Mars
      had
      th'
      ordering
      of
      their
      spirits;
      of
      Greeks,
      the
      learned
      Maid.
      But
      Terror
      follow'd
      both
      the
      hosts,
      and
      Flight,
      and
      furious
      Strife
      (The
      sister,
      and
      the
      mate,
      of
      Mars)
      that
      spoil
      of
      human

      And
      never

      her
      rage
      at
      rest,
      at
      first
      she

      small,
   
   
      That,
      while
      her
      feet
      move
      here
      in
      earth,
      her
      forehead
      is
      in
      heaven;
      And
      this
      was
      she
      that
      made
      even
      then
      both
      hosts
      so
      deadly
      given.
      Through
      every
      troop
      she
      stalk'd,
      and
      stirr'd
      rough
      sighs
      up
      as
      she
      went;
      But
      when
      in
      one
      field
      both
      the
      foes
      her
      fury
      did
      content,
      And
      both
      came
      under
      reach
      of
      darts,
      then
      darts
      and
      shields
      oppos'd
      To
      darts
      and
      shields;
      strength
      answer'd
      strength;
      then
      swords
      and
      targets
      clos'd
      With
      swords
      and
      targets;
      both
      with
      pikes;
      and
      then
      did
      tumult
      rise
   
   
      Of
      silver
      Simois,
      to
      see
      her
      parents'
      flocks,
      with
      them
      She,
      feeling
      suddenly
      the
      pains
      of
      child-birth,
      by
      the
      stream
      Of
      that
      bright
      river
      brought
      him
      forth;
      and
      so
      (of
      Simois)
      They
      call'd
      him
      Simoisius.
      Sweet
      was
      that
      birth
      of
      his
      To
      his
      kind
      parents,
      and
      his
      growth
      did
      all
      their
      care
      employ;
      And
      yet
      those
      rites
      of
      piety,
      that
      should
      have
      been
      his
      joy
      To
      pay
      their
      honour'd
      years
      again
      in
      as
      affectionate
      sort,
      He
      could
      not
      graciously
      perform,
      his
      sweet
      life
      was
      so
      short,
   
   
      She
      gave
      it,
      marching
      in
      the
      midst.
      
         
         Then
         flew
         the
         fatal
         hour
      
      Back
      on
      Diores,
   
   
      It
      took
      his
      forward-turned
      back,
      and
      look'd
      out
      of
      his
      breast;
      His
      huge
      trunk
      sounded,
      and
      his
      arms
      did
      echo
      the
      resound.
   
   
      His
      body's
      ruin,
      and
      his
      arms,
      so
      sounded
      in
      his
      fall,
      That
      his
      affrighted
      horse
      flew
      off,
      and
      left
      him,
      
      his
      life.
   
   
      As
      tenderly
      as
      those
      she
      lov'd.
      Phylides
      near
      him
      stept,
      And
      in
      the
      fountain
      of
      his
      nerves
      did
      drench
      his
      fervent
      lance,
      At
      his
      head's
      back-part;
      and
      so
      far
      the
      sharp
      head
      did
      advance,
      It
      cleft
      the
      organ
      of
      his
      speech,
      and
      th'
      iron,
      cold
      as
      death,
      He
      took
      betwixt
      his
      grinning
      teeth,
      and
      gave
      the
      air
      his
      breath.
   
   
      To
      heir
      his
      goods,
      yet
      Diomed
      took
      both,
      and
      left
      him
      store
      Of
      tears
      and
      sorrows
      in
      their
      steads,
      since
      he
      could
      never
      see
      His
      sons
      leave
      those
      hot
      wars
      alive;
      so
      this
      the
      end
      must
      be
      Of
      all
      his
      labours;
      what
      he
      heap'd
      to
      make
      his
      issue
      great
      Authority
      heir'd,
      and
      with
      her
      seed
      fill'd
      his
      forgotten
      seat.
   
   
      
      Authority
      heir'd--
      The
      word
      that
      Chapman
      here
      translates
      authority
      is
      in
   
   
      Blood,
      such
      as
      flows
      in
      blessed
      Gods,
      that
      eat
      no
      human
      food,
      Nor
      drink
      of
      our
      inflaming
      wine,
      and
      therefore
      bloodless
      are,
      And
      call'd
      Immortals;
      out
      she
      cried,
      and
      could
      no
      longer
      bear
   
   
      I

      from
      his
      bloody
      hand.
      Now
      battle
      is
      not
      given
      To
      any
      Trojans
      by
      the
      Greeks,
      but
      by
      the
      Greeks
      to
      heaven."
      She
      answer'd:
      "Daughter,
      think
      not
      much,
      though
      much
      it
      grieve
   
   
      And
      he
      by
      stealth
      enfranchis'd
      him;
      though
      he
      could
      scarce
      enjoy
      The
      benefit
      of
      franchisement,
      the
      chains
      did
      so
      destroy
      His
      vital
      forces
      with
      their
      weight.
      So
      Juno
      suffer'd
      more
   
   
      Not
      knowing
      he
      that
      fights
      with
      Heaven
      hath
      never
      long
      to
      live,
   
   
      Strength-trusting
      man,
      though
      thou
      be
      strong,
      and
      art
      in
      strength
      a
      tower,
      Take
      heed
      a
      stronger
      meet
      thee
      not,
      and
      that
      a
      woman's
      power
      Contains
      not
      that
      superior
      strength,
      and
      lest
      that
      woman
      be
   
   
      And
      ask'd
      him:
      "What!
      Not
      yield
      to
      gods?
      Thy
      equals
      learn
      to
      know.
      The
      race
      of
      Gods
      is
      far
      above
      men
      creeping
      here
      below."
   
   
      This
      stung
      great
      Hector's
      heart;
      and
      yet,
      as
      every
      generous
      mind
      Should
      silent
      bear
      a
      just
      reproof,
      and
      show
      what
      good
      they
      find
      In
      worthy
      counsels,
      by
      their
      ends
      put
      into
      present
      deeds,
      Not
      stomach
      nor
      be
      vainly
      sham'd,
      so
      Hector's
      spirit
      proceeds,
   
   
      Then
      with
      the
      feet
      of
      horse
      and
      foot
      the
      dust
      in
      clouds
      did
      rise;
      And
      as,
      in
      sacred
      floors
      of
      barns,
      upon
      corn-winnowers
      flies
      The
      chaff,
      driven
      with
      an
      opposite
      wind,
      when
      yellow
      Ceres
      dites,
      Which
      all
      the
      diters'
      feet,
      legs,
      arms,
      their
      heads
      and
      shoulders
      whites,
      So
      look'd
      the
      Grecians
      grey
      with
      dust,
      that
      struck
      the
      solid
      heaven,
      Rais'd
      from
      returning
      chariots,
      and
      troops
      together
      driven.
      Each
      side
      stood
      to
      their
      labours
      firm.
      Fierce
      Mars
      flew
      through
      the
      air,
   
   
      "O
      friends,"
      said
      he,
      "hold
      up
      your
      minds;
      
         
         strength
         is
         but
         strength
         of
         will;
      
   
   
      Began
      as
      if
      he
      had
      her
      pow'r,
      and
      show'd
      
         
         the
         mortal
         state
         Of
         too
         much
         confidence
         in
         man,
      
      with
      this
      superfluous
      brave:
   
   
      And
      what
      he
      threaten'd,
      th'
      other
      gave,
      that
      darkness,
      and
      that
      hell.
   
   
      Tydeus
      exampled
      not
      himself
      in
      thee
      his
      son;
      not
      great,
      But
      yet
      he
      was
      a
      soldier;
      a
      man
      of
      so
      much
      heat,
      That
      in
      his
      embassy
      for
      Thebes,
      when
      I
      forbad
      his
      mind
      To
      be
      too
      vent'rous,
      and
      when
      feasts
      his
      heart
      might
      have
      declin'd,
      With
      which
      they
      welcom'd
      him,
      he
      made
      a
      challenge
      to
      the
      best,
      And
      foil'd
      the
      best;
      I
      gave
      him
      aid,
      because
      the
      rust
      of
      rest,
      That
      would
      have
      seiz'd
      another
      mind,
      he
      suffer'd
      not,
      but
      us'd
      The
      trial
      I
      made
      
      a
      man,
      and
      their
      soft
      feasts
      refus'd.
      Yet,
      when
      I
      set
      thee
      on,
      thou
      faint'st;
      I
      guard
      thee,
      charge,
      exhort
      That,
      I
      abetting
      thee,
      thou
      shouldst
      be
      
         
         to
         the
         Greeks
         a
         fort,
         And
         a
         dismay
         to
         Ilion,
      
      yet
      thou
      obey'st
      in
      nought,
      Afraid,
      or
      slothful,
      or
      else
      both;
      henceforth
      renounce
      all
      thought
      That
      ever
      thou
      wert
      Tydeus'
      son."
      He
      answer'd
      her:
      "I
      know
      Thou
      art
      Jove's
      daughter,
      and,
      for
      that,
      in
      all
      just
      duty
      owe
      Thy
      speeches
      reverence,
      yet
      affirm
      ingenuously
      that
      fear
   
   
      With
      note
      and
      reverence
      of
      your
      charge."
      "My
      dearest
      mind,"
      said
      she,
      "What
      then
      was
      fit
      is
      chang'd.
      'Tis
      true,

      But
      just

      otherwise
      he
      raves,
      not
      fights.
      He's
      alter'd
      far.
   
   
      In

      He
      had
      of
      wealth
      a
      well,
      And
      yet
      was
      kind
      and
      bountiful,

      would
      a
      traveller

      To
      be
      his
      guest,
      his

      in
      the
      broad

      In
      which
      he
      all
      sorts
      nobly
      us'd,
      yet
      none
      of
      them
      would
      stand
      'Twixt
      him
      and
      death,

      Nourish

      Come

      The
      race
      of
      man
      is,
      that
      deserves
      no
      question;
      nor
      receives
      My
      being
      any
      other
      breath?
      The
      wind
      in
      autumn
      strows
      The
      earth
      with
      old
      leaves,
      then
      the
      spring
      the
      woods

      And
      so
      death
      scatters
      men
      on
      earth,
      so
      life
      puts
      out
      again

      particular

      this,
      to
      many
      known:
      In
      midst
      of
      Argos,
      nurse
      of
      horse,
      there
      stands
      a
      walled
      town,
      Ephyre,
      where
      the
      mansion-house
      of
      Sisyphus
      did
      stand,
   
   
      The

      plac'd

      the

      She
      herself
      descended,

      search'd
      out,
      Within
      a
      place
      that
      breath'd
      perfumes,
      the
      richest
      robe
      she
      had;
      Which
      lay
      with
      many
      rich
      ones
      more,
      most
      curiously
      made
      By
      women
      of
      Sidonia,
      which
      Paris
      brought
      from
      thence,
      Sailing
      the
      broad
      sea,
      when
      he
      made
      that
      voyage
      of
      offence
      In
      which
      he
      brought
      home
      Helena.
      That
      robe
      transferr'd
      so
      far
      (That
      was
      the
      undermost)
      she
      took;
      it
      glitter'd
      
      a
      star;
   
   
      the
      brazen
      head
      went
      shining
      in
      before,
   
   
      But
      he
      is
      senseless,
      
         nor
         conceives
         what
         any
         manhood
         is,
      
   
   
      Her
      son,
      borne
      in
      his
      nurse's
      arms;
      when,
      
      a
      heavenly
      sign,
      Compact
      of
      many
      golden
      stars,
      the
      princely
      child
      did
      shine,

      survives
   
   
      Thou
      amply

      joy,
   
   
      Into
      their
      wits,
      or
      courages."
      To
      this,
      great
      Hector
      said:
      
         "Be
         well
         assured,
         wife,
         all
         these
         things
         in
         my
         kind
         cares
         are
         weighed.
      
      But
      what
      a
      shame,
      and
      fear,
      it
      is
      to
      think
      how
      Troy
      would
      scorn
      (Both
      in
      her
      husbands
      and
      her
      wives,
      whom
      long-train'd
      gowns
      adorn)
      That
      I
      should
      cowardly
      fly
      off!
      The
      spirit!
      first
      did
      breath
      Did
      never
      teach
      me
      that;
      much
      less,
      
         
         since
         the
         contempt
         of
         death
         Was
         settled
         in
         me,
      
      and
      my
      mind
      knew
      what
      a
      worthy
      was
      Whose
      office
      is
      to
      lead
      in
      fight,
      and
      give
      no
      danger
      pass
      Without
      improvement.
      In
      this
      fire
      must
      Hector's
      trial
      shine;
      Here
      must
      his
      country,
      father,
      friends,
      be,
      in
      him,
      made
      divine.
      And
      such
      a
      stormy
      day
      shall
      come
      (in
      mind
      and
      soul
      I
      know)
      When
      sacred
      Troy
      shall
      shed
      her
      tow'rs
      for
      tears
      of
      overthrow,
      When
      Priam,
      all
      his
      birth
      and
      pow'r,
      shall
      in
      those
      tears
      be
      drown'd.
      But
      neither
      Troy's
      posterity
      so
      much
      my
      soul
      doth
      wound,
      Priam,
      nor
      Hecuba
      herself,
      nor
      all
      my
      brothers'
      woes,
      (Who
      though
      so
      many,
      and
      so
      good,
      must
      all
      be
      food
      for
      foes)
      As
      thy
      sad
      state,
      when
      some
      rude
      Greek
      shall
      lead
      thee
      weeping
      hence,
      These
      free
      days
      clouded,
      and
      a
      night
      of
      captive
      violence
      Loading
      thy
      temples,
      out
      of
      which
      thine
      eyes
      must
      never
      see,
      But
      spin
      the
      Greek
      wives'
      webs
      of
      task,
      and
      their
      fetch-water
      be
      To
      Argos,
      from
      Messeides,
      or
      clear
      Hyperia's
      spring;
      Which
      howsoever
      thou
      abhorr'st,
      
         
         Fate's
         such
         a
         shrewish
         thing
         She
         will
         be
         mistress;
      
      whose
      curs'd
      hands,
      when
      they
      shall
      crush
      out
      cries
      From
      thy
      oppressions
      (being
      beheld
      by
      other
      enemies)
   
   
      Thus
      they
      will
      nourish
      thy
      extremes:
      'This
      dame
      was
      Hector's
      wife,
      A
      man
      that,
      at
      the
      wars
      of
      Troy,
      did
      breathe
      the
      worthiest
      life
      Of
      all
      their
      army.'
      This
      again
      will
      rub
      thy
      fruitful
      wounds,
      To
      miss
      the
      man
      that
      to
      thy
      bands
      could
      give
      such
      narrow
      bounds.
      
         But
         that
         day
         shall
         not
         wound
         mine
         eyes;
         the
         solid
         heap
         of
         night
      
      Shall
      interpose,
      and
      stop
      mine
      ears
      against
      thy
      plaints,
      and
      plight."
      This
      said,
      he
      reach'd
      to
      take
      his
      son,
      who,
      of
      his
      arms
      afraid,
   
   
      bench
      of
      Gods:
   
   
      With
      these
      vain
      griefs.
      He
      doth
      not
      live
      that
      can
      disjoin
      my
      life
      And
      this
      firm
      bosom,
      but
      my
      fate;
      and
      fate,
      whose
      wings
      can
      fly?
      Noble,
      ignoble,
      fate
      controls.
      
         Once
         born,
         the
         best
         must
         die.

         their
         lower
         ebb.
      
   
   
      And
      as
      a
      fair
      steed
      proud
      With
      full-given
      mangers,
      long
      tied
      up,
      and
      now,
      his
      head-stall
      broke,
      He
      breaks
      from
      stable,
      runs
      the
      field,
      and
      with
      an
      ample
      stroke
      Measures
      the
      centre,
      neighs,
      and
      lifts
      aloft
      his
      wanton
      head,
      About
      his
      shoulders
      shakes
      his
      crest,
      and
      where
      he
      hath
      been
      fed,

      some
      calm
      flood
      wash'd,
      or,
      
         stung
         with
         his
         high
         plight,
      
      he
      flies
      Amongst
      his
      females,
      strength
      put
      forth,
      his
      beauty
      beautifies,
      And,
      
      life's
      mirror,
      bears
      his
      gait;
      so
      Paris
      from
      the
      tow'r
      Of
      lofty
      Pergamus
      came

      In
      carriage
      of
      his
      goodly
      parts,
      address'd
      now
      to
      the
      strife;

      will

      thy
      ability.
   
   
      On
      Jove's
      beech
      
      two

      think

      whose
      strength
      wild
      nourishment
      doth
      make
      so
      wondrous
      great.
   
   
      thee
      skill
      to
      use
      thy
      strength,
   
   
      Heaven
      yields

      best

      age,
   
   
      Then
      cherish'd
      he
      his
      famous
      horse:
      "O
      Xanthus,

      said
      he,

      solemn
      harp,

      was

      With
      works
      conceited
      through
      the

      embrac'd
      His

      was

      laid
      waste
   
   
      Aetion's
      city,
      he
      did
      choose

      loving
      sacred
      music
      well,
      made
      it

      Quite--
      requite,

      Speak,
      
         come
         not

      thou
      here?"
   
   
      And
      both
      took
      course
      to
      Diomed.
      They
      found
      him
      laid
      in

      Far
      from
      his
      tent;
      his

      by;
      about

      His
      spear
      fix'd
      by

      his
      royal

      had
      stay
      On
      arras
      hangings,
      rolled
      up;
      whereon
      he
      slept
      so
      fast,
   
   
      But,
      you
      must
      see,

      Ulysses,
      loth
      to
      be
      esteem'd
      a
      lover
      of
      his
      praise,
      With
      such
      exceptions
      humbled
      him
      as
      did
      him
      higher
      raise,
   
   
      With
      snowy
      tusks
      of
      white-mouth'd
      boars
      'twas
      armed
      round
      about
   
   
      Then
      spake
      he,
      threat'ning
      with
      his
      lance:
      "Or

      death
      outgone."
      This
      said,
      he
      threw
      his
      javelin
      forth;
      which
      miss'd
      as
      Diomed
      Would,
      Above
      his
      right
      arm
      making
      way,
      the
      pile
      stuck
      in
      the
      mould.
      He
      stay'd
      and
      trembled,
      and
      his
      teeth
      did
      chatter
      in
      his
      head.
      They
      came
      in
      blowing,
      seiz'd
      him
      fast;
      he,
      weeping,
      offered
   
   
      
         Tydides
         dreadfully
         replied:
      
      "Think

         sunder
         wound,
         And
         suddenly
         his
         head,
         deceiv'd,
         
            fell
            speaking
         
         on
         the
         ground.
         His
         weasel's
         helm
         they
         took,
         his
         bow,
         his
         wolf's
         skin,
         and
         his
         lance,
      
      Which
      to
      Minerva
      Ithacus
      did
      zealously
      advance,
      With
      lifted
      arm
      into
      the
      air;
      and
      to
      her
      thus
      he
      spake:
   
   
      
         An
         ill
         dream
      
      by
      Minerva
      sent
      that
      night
      stood
      by
      his
      head,
      Which
      was
      Oenides'
      royal
      son,
      unconquer'd
      Diomed.
   
   
      The
      red-ey'd
      Goddess,
      seated
      there,
      thunder'd
      th'
      Orthian
      song,
      High,
      and
      with
      horror,
      through
      the
      ears
      of
      all
      the
      Grecian
      throng.
      Her
      verse
      with
      spirits
      invincible
      did
      all
      their
      breasts
      inspire,
      Blew
      out
      all
      darkness
      from
      their
      limbs,
      and
      set
      their
      hearts
      on
      fire,
      And
      presently
      was
      bitter
      war
      more
      sweet
      a
      thousand
      times
      Than
      any
      choice
      in
      hollow
      keels
      to
      greet
      their
      native
      climes.
   
   
      But
      when
      in

      Vales
      the
      timber-feller
      takes
      A
      sharp
      set
      stomach
      to
      his
      meat,
      and
      dinner
      ready
      makes,
      so
      His
      sinews
      fainting,
      and
      his
      spirits
      become
      surcharg'd
      and
      dull,
      Time
      of
      accustom'd
      ease
      arriv'd,
      his
      hands
      with
      labour
      full,
      Then
      by
      their
      valours
      Greeks
      brake
      through
      the
      Trojan
      ranks,
      and
      cheer'd
   
   
      Where

      snatch'd
      in
      his
      solid
      jaws,
      and
      
         crusheth
         into
         mist
      
   
   
      his
      brother
      crouch'd

      flight,
      the
      batter'd
      centre
      flew
      In
      clouds
      of
      dust
      about
      their
      ears,
      rais'd
      from
      the
      horses'
      hooves,
      That
      beat
      a
      thunder
      out
      of
      earth
      as
      horrible
      as
      Jove's.
   
   
      Thick
      fell
      the
      Trojans,
      
         much
         more
         sweet
         to
         vultures
         than
         their
         wives.

      He
      fell
      and
      slept
      an
      iron
      sleep;
      wretched
      young
      man,
      he
      died,
      Far
      from
      his
      newly-married
      wife,
      in
      aid
      of
      foreign
      pride,
      And
      saw
      no
      pleasure
      of
      his
      love;
      yet
      was
      her
      jointure
      great,
      An
      hundred
      oxen
      gave
      he
      her,
      and
      vow'd
      in
      his
      retreat
   
   
      The
      king's
      brass
      javelin,
      as
      he
      drew,
      did
      strike
      him
      helpless
      dead;

      the
      worst
      it
      gives,
      With
      thought
      it
      must
      be,

      with

      Thrice
      shouted
      he
      aloud,
      As
      did
      denote
      a
      man
      engag'd.
   
   
      He
      told
      him
      of
      Ulysses'
      shouts,
      as
      if
      he

      near
      a

      cries,

      boys

      overborne
      By
      his
      insensible
      approach,

      simply
      he
      will
      eat,
      About
      whom
      many
      wands
      are
      broke,

      self-providing
      ass

      with
      their
      weakness

      father,
      our
      great
      friend

      apt
      to
      take
      offence,

      would
      not
      smother
      it
      in
      moods.
   
   
      And
      I
      had
      honour
      of
      my
      youth

      dies

      engor'd,
      In
      her
      strong
      seres,
      of
      wondrous
      size,
      and
      yet
      had
      no
      such
      check
      In
      life
      and
      spirit
      but
      still
      she
      fought,
      and
      turning
      back
      her
      neck
      So
      stung
      the
      eagle's
      gorge,
      that
      down
      she
      cast
      her
      fervent
      prey
      Amongst
      the
      multitude,
      and
      took
      upon
      the
      winds
      her
      way,
      Crying
      with
      anguish.
      When
      they
      saw
      a
      branded
      serpent

      full

      breasts
      of
      both;
      fill'd
      both
      their
      spirits,
      and
      made
      up
      every
      joint
      With
      pow'r
      responsive;
      when,
      hawk-,
      swift,
      and
      set
      sharp
      to
      fly,
      
         Hard,
         and
         gets
         ground
         still;
         Neptune
         so
         left
         these
         two,
         either's
         mind
      
   
   
      For
      he,
      in
      sight
      of
      all
      the
      host,
      Othryoneus
      slew,
      That
      from
      Cabesus,
      with
      the
      fame
      of
      those
      wars,
      thither
      drew
      His
      new-come
      forces,
      and
      requir'd,
      without
      respect
      of
      dow'r,
      Cassandra,
      fair'st
      of
      Priam's
      race;
      assuring
      with
      his
      pow'r,
      A
      mighty
      labour,
      to
      expel,
      in
      their
      despite,
      from
      Troy
      The
      sons
      of
      Greece.
      The
      king
      did
      vow,
      that
      done,
      he
      should
      enjoy
      His
      goodliest
      daughter.
      He,
      in
      trust
      of
      that
      fair
      purchase,
      fought;
      And
      at
      him
      threw
      the
      Cretan
      king
      a
      lance,
      that
      singled
      out
      
         This
         great
         assumer,
      
      whom
      it
      struck
      just
      in
      his
      navel-stead.
      His
      brazen
      curets
      helping
      nought
      resign'd
      him
      to
      the
      dead.
   
   
      "Now
      Asius
      lies
      not
      unreveng'd,
      nor
      doth
      his
      spirit
      want
      The
      joy
      I
      wish
      it,
      though
      it
      be
      now
      ent'ring
      the
      strong
      gate
      Of
      mighty
      Pluto,
      since
      this
      hand
      hath
      sent
      him
      down
      a
      mate."
   
   
      Of
      glory
      in
      Deiphobus,
      thus
      terribly
      exclaim'd:
      "Deiphobus,
      now
      may
      we
      think
      that
      we
      are
      evenly
      fam'd
      
         That
         three
         for
         one
         have
         sent
         to
         Dis.
      
      But
      come,
      change
      blows
      with
      me,
      Thy
      vaunts
      for
      him
      thou
      slew'st
      were
      vain.
      Come,
      wretch,
      that
      thou
      may'st
      see
      What
      issue
      Jove
      hath.
      Jove
      begot
      Minos,
      the
      strength
      of
      Crete;
      Minos
      begot
      Deucalion;
      Deucalion
      did
      beget
      Me
      Idomen,
      now
      Creta's
      king,
      that
      here
      my
      ships
      have
      brought
      To
      bring
      thyself,
      thy
      father,
      friends,
      all
      Ilion's
      pomp,
      to
      nought."
      Deiphobus
      at
      two
      ways
      stood,
      in
      doubt
      to
      call
      some
      one,
      With
      some
      retreat,
      to
      be
      his
      aid,
      or
      try
      the
      chance
      alone.
   
   
      
      sad
      and
      suspicious
      hearts
      Distemp'ring
      them,
   
   
      Whom
      Jove
      in
      his
      embraces
      holds."
      This
      spoken,
      she
      untied,
      And
      from
      her
      odorous
      bosom
      took,.her
      Ceston,
      in
      whose
      sphere
      Were
      all
      enticements
      to
      delight,
      all
      loves,
      all
      longings
      were,
      Kind
      conference,
      fair
      speech,
      whose
      pow'r
      the
      wisest
      doth
      inflame.
      This
      she
      resigning
      to
      her
      hands,
      thus
      urg'd
      her
      by
      her
      name:
   
   
      Death's
      brother,
      Sleep,
   
   
      Besides
      Jove,
      but
      I
      would
      becalm;
   
   
      Of
      travail
      with
      me,
      that
      must
      draw
      my
      coach
      through
      earth
      and
      seas.
      Whose
      far-intended
      reach,
      respect,
      and
      care
      not
      to
      displease
      Thy
      graces,
      made
      me
      not

      The

      God
      her
      guile
      in
      this
      sort
      did
      receive:
   
   
      And
      ran
      in
      at
      the

      a
      load
      of
      strength
      laid
      Ajax
      on
      As

      that
      head
      and
      face
      the

      possessions
      took,
      When
      all
      the
      low
      parts
      sprung
      in
      air,
      and
      thus
      did
      Ajax
      quit
      Panthuzdes'
      brave:
      "Now,

      By

      was
      the

      Greek.
      But
      him
      Jove
      look'd
      upon
      With
      eyes
      of
      pity;
      on
      his
      wife
      with
      horrible
      aspect,
      To
      whom
      he
      said:

      I

      formerly,
      so
      now,
      these

      thee
      up,
      how
      to
      thy
      feet
      I
      tied
      Two
      anvils,
      golden
      manacles
      on
      thy
      false
      wrists
      implied,

      let
      thee
      mercilessly

      seiz'd
      upon

      piece-meal
      dash'd
      the

      Nor

      my
      angry
      spirit
      calm'd
      so
      soon,
      for
      those
      foul

      On
      which,
      inducing
      northern
      flaws,
      thou
      shipwrack'dst
      Hercules,
      And
      toss'd
      him
      to
      the
      Coan
      shore,

      importance,

      freed
      my

      him
      safe
      ill

      nurse
      of
      horse.

      This
      heard,
      his
      charge
      she
      seem'd
      t'

      and
      to
      Olympus
      flew.

      now
      goes,
      still

      ways
      inclin'd;
      So
      reverend
      Juno
      headlong
      flew,
      and
      'gainst

      soon

      Immortals'
      fare,
      Though
      well
      you
      hear
      amongst

      Thus
      took
      she
      place,
      displeasedly;
      the
      feast
      in
      general
      Bewraying
      privy
      spleens
      at

      where
      death
      strikes
      I
      will

      Meantime
      I
      wish

      And
      as
      when
      arms
      enfold
      A
      city
      in
      an
      isle,
      from
      thence
      a
      fume
      at

      appears,
      Being

      men
      nigh,
      Seeing
      their
      distress,
      perhaps
      may
      set
      ships
      out
      to
      their

      So,

      such

      his
      head
      a

      rose,
      scaling
      heaven,
      And
      forth
      the
      wall
      he
      stept

      stood,
      nor

      the
      precept
      given

      his

      heard
   
   
      Twelve
      men
      of
      greatest
      strength
      in
      Troy
      left
      with
      their
      lives
      exhal'd
      I
      Their
      chariots
      and
      their
      darts,
      to
      death
      with
      his
      three
      summons
      call'd.
      And
      then
      the
      Grecians
      spritefully
      drew
      from
      the
      darts
      the
      corse,
   
   
      
         This
         counsel
         gat
         applause
         of
         all,
         so
         much
         were
         all
         unwise;
         Minerva
         robb'd
         them
         of
         their
         brains,
         to
         
         the
         ill
         advice
      
      The
      great
      man
      gave,
      and
      leave
      the
      good
      since
      by
      the
      meaner
      given.
   
   
      This
      said,
      he
      left
      her
      there,
      and
      forth
      did
      to
      his
      bellows
      go,
      Appos'd
      them
      to
      the
      fire
      again,
      commanding
      them
      to
      blow.
      Through
      twenty
      holes
      made
      to
      his
      hearth
      at
      once
      blew
      twenty
      pair,
      That
      fir'd
      his
      coals,
      sometimes
      with
      soft,
      sometimes
      with
      vehement,
      air,
      As
      he
      will'd,
      and
      his
      work
      requir'd.
      Amids
      the
      flame
      he
      cast
      Tin,
      silver,
      precious
      gold,
      and
      brass;
      and
      in
      the
      stock
      he
      plac'd
      A
      mighty
      anvil;
      his
      right
      hand
      a
      weighty
      hammer
      held,
      His
      left
      his
      tongs.
      And
      first
      he
      forg'd
      a
      strong
      and
      spacious
      shield
      Adorn'd
      with
      twenty
      several
      hues;
      about
      whose
      verge
      he
      beat
      A
      ring,
      three-fold
      and
      radiant,
      and
      on
      the
      back
      he
      set
      A
      silver
      handle;
      five-fold
      were
      the
      equal
      lines
      he
      drew
      About
      the
      whole
      circumference,
      in
      which
      his
      hand
      did
      shew
      (Directed
      with
      a
      knowing
      mind)
      a
      rare
      variety;
      For
      in
      it
      he
      presented
      Earth;
      in
      it
      the
      Sea
      and
      Sky;
      In
      it
      the
      never-wearied
      Sun,
      the
      Moon
      exactly
      round,
      And
      all
      those
      Stars
      with
      which
      the
      brows
      of
      ample
      heaven
      are
      crown'd

      the

      Hyades,

      surnam'd
      the
      That
      turns
      about
      heaven's
      axle-tree,
      holds
      ope
      a
      constant
      eye
      Upon
      Orion,
      and
      of
      all
      the
      cressets
      in
      the
      sky
      His
      golden
      forehead
      never

      Two
      cities
      in
      the
      spacious
      field
      he
      built,

      goodly
      state

      To
      these
      the
      fiery
      Artizan
      did
      add
      a
      new-ear'd
      field,
      Large
      and
      thrice
      plough'd,
      the
      soil
      being
      soft,
      and
      of
      a
      wealthy
      yield;
      And
      many
      men
      at
      plough
      he
      made,
      that
      drave
      earth
      here
      and
      there,
      And
      turn'd
      up
      stitches
      orderly,
      at
      whose
      end
      when
      they
      were,
      A
      fellow
      ever
      gave
      their
      hands
      full
      cups
      of
      luscious
      wine;
      Which
      emptied,
      for
      another
      stitch,
      the
      earth
      they
      undermine,
      And
      long
      till
      th'
      utmost
      bound
      be
      reach'd
      of
      all
      the
      ample
      close.
      The
      soil
      turn'd
      up
      behind
      the
      plough
      all
      black
      
      earth
      arose,
      Though
      forg'd
      of
      nothing
      else
      but
      gold,
      and
      lay
      in

      as
      light
      As
      if
      it
      had
      been
      plough'd
      indeed,
      miraculous
      to
      sight.
   
   
      Of
      our
      debate,
      that
      Fury
      stole
      in
      that
      act
      on
      my
      pow'r.
      And
      more;
      all
      things
      are
      done
      by
      strife;
      that
      ancient
      seed
      of
      Jove,
      Ate,
      that
      hurts
      all,
      perfects
      all,
      her
      feet
      are
      soft,
      and
      move
      Not
      on
      the
      earth,
      they
      hear
      her
      still
      aloft
      men's
      heads,
      and
      there
   
   
      The
      conflict
      wearing
      out
      our
      men
      was
      late,
      and
      held
      as
      long,
      Wherein,
      though
      most
      Jove
      stood
      for
      Troy,
      he
      yet
      made
      our
      part
      strong
      To
      bear
      that
      most.
      But
      'twas
      to
      bear,
      and
      that
      breeds
      little
      heart.
      Let
      wine
      and
      bread
      then
      add
      to
      it;
      they
      help
      the
      twofold
      part,
      The
      soul
      and
      body,
      in
      a
      man,
      both
      force
      and
      fortitude.
      All
      day
      men
      cannot
      fight
      and
      fast,
      though
      never
      so
      indued
      With
      minds
      to
      fight,
      for,
      that
      suppos'd,
      there
      lurks
      yet
      secretly
      Thirst,
      hunger,
      in
      th'
      oppressed
      joints
      which
      no
      mind
      can
      supply.
      They
      take
      away
      a
      marcher's
      knees.
      Men's
      bodies
      throughly
      fed,
      Their
      minds
      share
      with
      them
      in
      their
      strength;
      and,
      all
      day
      combated,
      One
      stirs
      not,
      till
      you
      call
      off
      all.
      Dismiss
      them
      then
      to
      meat,
      And
      let
      Atrides
      tender
      here,
      in
      sight
      of
      all
      this
      seat,
   
   
      Nor
      will
      it
      aught
      impair
      a

      "I
      joy,"
      replied
      the
      king,
   
   
      That
      one
      day's
      moan
      should
      serve
      one
      man.
      The
      dead
      must
      end
      with
      death,
   
   
      And
      thy
      unwearied
      steel
      as
      right,
      nor
      utterly
      be
      beat
      With
      
         only
         cruelty
         of
         words,
      
      not
      proof
      against
      a
      threat."
   
   
      And
      manifest
      their
      proper
      forms,
      are
      passing
      dreadful
      then."
   
   
      Fell
      anger
      lathers
      in
      his
      jaws,
   
   
      But
      Jove
      gives
      virtue;
      he
      augments,
      and
      he
      impairs
      the
      worth
      Of
      all
      men;
      and
      his
      will
      their
      rule;
      he,
      strong'st,
      all
      strength
      affords.
   
   
      Is
      better
      and
      more
      dear
      than
      thee
      ?
      Hereafter,
      lest,
      past
      fates,
      Hell
      be
      thy
      headlong
      home,
      retire,

      bold
      stand
      never
      near.
      Where
      he
      advanceth.
      But
      his
      fate
      once
      satisfied,
      then
      bear
      A
      free
      and
      full
      sail;
      no
      Greek
      else
      shall
      end
      thee."
      This
      reveal'd,
      He
      left
      him,
      and
      dispers'd
      the
      cloud
      that
      all
      this
      act
      conceal'd
   
   
      Near
      fishy
      Hyllus
      and
      the
      gulfs
      of
      Hermus,
      but
      this
      day
   
   
      Out
      at
      his
      navel.
      On
      his
      knees
      the
      poor
      prince
      crying
      fell,
      And
      gather'd
      with
      his
      tender
      hands
      his
      entrails
      that
      did
      swell
      Quite
      through
      the
      wide
      wound,
      till
      a
      cloud
      as
      black
      as
      death
      conceal'd
      Their
      sight,
      and
      all
      the
      world
      from
      him.
      When
      Hector
      had
      beheld
      His
      brother
      tumbled
      so
      to
      earth,
      his
      entrails
      still
      in
      hand,
      Dark
      sorrow
      overcast
      his
      eyes,
      nor
      far
      off
      could
      he
      stand
   
   
      and
      'tis
      this."
   
   
      In
      his
      hot
      fury,
      he
      was
      none
      of
      these
      remorseful
      men,
      Gentle
      and
      affable,
      but
      fierce
      at
      all
      times,
      and
      mad
      then.

      Come
      then,
      he
      now
      shall
      taste
      The
      head
      of
      Pelias,
      and
      try
      if
      steel
      will
      down
      as
      fast
      As
      other

      any
      surer
      seize
      On
      his
      sly
      person,
      whose
      strong
      arms
      have
      held
      down
      Hercules."
      His
      thoughts
      thus
      mov'd
      while
      he
      stood
      firm;
      to
      see
      if
      he,
      he
      spied,
   
   
      An
      arrow
      that
      must
      reach
      my
      life."
      This
      said,
      
         a
         languishing
      
      Lycaon's
      heart
      bent
      
      his
      knees,
      yet
      left
      him
      strength
      t'
      advance
      Both
      hands
      for
      mercy
      as
      he
      kneel'd.

      in

      Quickly
