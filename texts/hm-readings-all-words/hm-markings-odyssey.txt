      I
      suppose
      his
      youth
      doth
      prayers
      use,
      Since
      all
      men
      need
      the
      Gods.
      But
      you
      I
      choose

      in

      a

         the
         Goddess
         it
         did
         add
         delight,
      
   
   
      And
      therefore
      many
      felt
      so
      sharp
      a
      fate,
      Sent
      from

      Eternal

      they
      please.
   
   
      We

      either
      other's
      woe;
      When
      Jove
      besides
      made
      ready
      woes
      enow.
   
   
      But
      I
      fled
      all,
      with
      all
      that
      follow'd
      me,
      Because
      I
      knew
      God
      studied
      misery,
   
   
      He
      answer'd:
      "O
      thou
      greatest
      grace
      of
      Greece,
      Orestes
      made

      him
      the

      by
      my
      mother's
      Wooers,
      being
      so
      foul,
      I
      might
      revenge
      upon
      their
      every

      Who,
      pressing
      me

      things

      to
      suffer
      everlastingly."
   
   
      So
      blest
      an
      honour.
      Not
      by
      any
      means,
      If
      Hope
      should
      prompt
      me,

      Helen
      now
      on
      new

      did
      stand,
      Infusing
      straight

      wine,
      That,
      drowning

      angers,
      did
      decline

      of
      ill.
      Who
      drunk
      her

      It

      thee
      not
      to
      be
      So
      cunning
      in
      thine

      again
      a
      generous
      spring
      began
      Of
      fitting
      comfort,
      as
      I
      was
      a
      man;
      But,
      as
      a
      brother,
      I
      must
      ever
      mourn.
   
   
      I
      had
      the
      passport
      now
      of
      every
      God,
   
   
      'Tis
      yet
      with
      other
      kings
      another
      right,
      One
      to
      pursue
      with
      love,
      another
      spite;
      He
      still

      though
      might,
      devour,
      Nor
      to
      the
      worst
      did
      ever
      taste
      of
      power.
      But
      their
      unrul'd
      acts
      show
      their
      minds'
      estate.
   
   
      And
      put
      in
      ships
      the
      trust
      of
      his
      distress,

      Nor
      in
      her
      choice
      of
      state
      chairs
      stood
      inclined
      To
      take
      her
      seat,
      but
      th'
      abject
      threshold
      chose
      Of
      her
      fair
      chamber

      her
      loath'd

      Give
      him

      Whose
      pride
      his
      youth
      had
      made
      the
      more
      extreme,
      Said:
      "Now
      the
      many-wooer-honour'd
      queen
      Will
      surely
      satiate
      her
      delayful
      spleen,
      And
      one
      of
      us
      in
      instant
      nuptials
      take.
      Poor
      dame,
      she
      dreams
      not,
      what

      Upon
      the
      life
      and
      slaughter
      of
      her
      son."
      So
      said
      he;
      but
      so
      said
      was
      not
      so
      done;
   
   
      That
      makes
      the
      horrid
      murmur
      beat
      above
      Took
      place

      said,
      the

      set,

      Thus
      dreadful
      is
      the
      presence
      of
      our
      death.
   
   
      When

      The

      succeeded;
      for

      To

      he
      cling'd
      for
      succour,
      off

      the

      so
      sore,
      That

      he
      fell,

      could
      sustain
      no

      Spent
      to
      all
      use,

      down
      he
      sunk

      death.
      
         The
         sea
         had
         soak'd
         his

      Where

      possible

      that

      In

      And
      as
      in
      some

      a

      rakes

      on;
      So
      this
      out-place
      Ulysses
      thus

      A

      Though
      merely

      did
      press
      The

      of
      soft-hair'd
      virgins.
      Horrid
      was
      His

      to
      them;

      More
      sweet,
      more
      worthy

      began,
      By

      the

      desires,
      the
      moving
      man,

      I
      see,
      the
      Gods
      to
      all
      men
      give
      not
      all

      fall,
      
      dice,
      upon
      the
      square
      still.
      Some
      man
      takes
      form
      from
      parents,
      but
      God
      often
      makes
      That
      fault
      of
      form
      up
      with
      observ'd
      repair
      Of
      pleasing
      speech,
      that
      makes
      him
      held
      for
      fair,
      That
      makes
      him
      speak
      securely,
      makes
      him
      shine
      In
      an
      assembly
      with
      a
      grace
      divine.
      Men
      take
      delight

      in
      honey
      modesty.
      Another,
      then,
      hath
      fashion
      
      a
      God,
      But
      in
      his
      language
      he
      is
      foul
      and
      broad.
      And
      such
      art
      thou.
      A
      person
      fair
      is
      given,
      But
      nothing
      else
      is
      in
      thee
      sent
      from
      heaven;
      For
      in
      thee
      lurks
      a
      base
      and
      earthy
      soul,
      And
      t'
      hast
      compell'd
      me,
      with
      a
      speech
      most
      foul,
      To
      be
      thus
      bitter,
      I
      am
      not
      unseen
      In
      these
      fair
      strifes,
      as
      thy
      words
   
   
      But
      urge
      the
      whole
      state
      of
      you;
      only
      one,
      I
      will
      not
      challenge
      in
      my
      forced
      boast,
      And
      that's
      Laodamas,
      for
      he's
      mine
      host.
      And
      who
      will
      fight,
      or
      wrangle,
      with
      his
      friend?
   
   
      Unwise
      he
      is,
      and
      base,
      that
      will
      contend
      With
      him
      that
      feeds
      him,
      in
      a
      foreign
      place;
      And
      takes
      all
      edge
      off
      from
      his
      own
      sought
      grace.
   
   
      
         And
         shook
         a
         most
         divine
         dance
         from
         their
         feet,
      
      That
      twinkled
      star-,
      mov'd
      as
      swift,
      and
      fine,
      And
      beat
      the
      air
      so
      thin,
      they
      made
      it
      shine.
      Ulysses
      wonder'd
      at
      it,
      but
      amaz'd
      He
      stood
      in
      mind
      to
      hear
      the
      dance
      so
      phras'd.
      For,
      as
      they
      danc'd,
      Demodocus
      did
      sing,
   
   
      The
      dancers'
      feet
      kept
      as
      his
      hands
      his
      cords.
      Ulysses
      much
      was
      pleased,
      and
      all
      the
      crew.
   
   
      
      make
      him
      hold
   
   My
   memory
   always
   dear,
   
      This
      when
      Ulysses
      heard,
      all
      sure
      her
      made,
      Enclosed

      North
      Cloud-gathering
      Jove
      a

      fresh

      took
      in,
      instantly
      Fell
      to

      Where,
      the
      first
      they
      met,
      Were
      the
      Lotophagi,
      that
      made
      them
      eat
      Their
      country
      diet,
      and
      no
      ill
      intent
      Hid
      in
      their
      hearts
      to
      them;
      and
      yet
      th'
      event
      To
      ill
      converted
      it,
      for,
      having
      eat
      Their
      dainty
      viands,
      they
      did
      quite
      forget
      (As
      all
      men
      else
      that
      did
      but
      taste
      their
      feast)
      Both
      countrymen
      and
      country,
      nor
      address'd
      Any
      return
      t'
      inform
      what
      sort
      of
      men
      Made
      fix'd
      abode
      there,
      but
      would
      needs
      maintain
      Abode
      themselves
      there,
      and
      eat
      that
      food
      ever.
      I
      made
      out
      after,
      and
      was
      feign
      to
      sever
      Th'
      enchanted
      knot
      by
      forcing
      their
      retreat,
      That
      strived,
      and
      wept,
      and
      would
      not
      leave
      their
      meat
      For
      heaven
      itself.
      But,
      dragging
      them
      to
      fleet,
      I
      wrapt
      in
      sure
      bands
      both
      their
      hands
      and
      feet,
      And
      cast
      them
      under
      hatches,
      and
      away
      Commanded
      all
      the
      rest
      without
      least
      stay,
   
   
      Lest
      they
      should
      taste
      the
      lote
      too,
      and
      forget
      With
      such
      strange
      raptures
      their
      despised
      retreat.
   
   
      Of
      massy
      silver;
      but
      his
      gift
      most
      famed
      Was
      twelve
      great
      vessels,
      fill'd
      with
      such
      rich
      wine
      As
      was
      incorruptible
      and
      divine.
      He
      kept
      it
      as
      his
      jewel,
      which
      none
      knew
      But
      he
      himself,
      his
      wife,
      and
      he
      that
      drew.
      It
      was
      so
      strong,
      that
      never
      any
      fill'd
      A
      cup,
      where
      that
      was
      but
      by
      drops
      instill'd,
      And
      drunk
      it
      off,
      but
      'twas
      before
      allay'd
      With
      twenty
      parts
      in
      water;
      yet
      so
      sway'd
      The
      spirit
      of
      that
      little,
      that
      the
      whole
      A
      sacred
      odour
      breath'd
      about
      the
      bowl.
      Had
      you
      the
      odour
      smelt
      and
      scent
      it
      cast,
      It
      would
      have
      vex'd
      you
      to
      forbear
      the
      taste.
      But
      then,
      the
      taste
      gain'd
      too,
      the
      spirit
      it
      wrought
      To
      dare
      things
      high
      set
      up
      an
      end
      my
      thought.
      Of
      this
      a
      huge
      great
      flagon
      full
      I
      bore,
   
   
      That
      in
      thy
      recompense
      I
      may
      bestow
      A
      hospitable
      gift
      on
      thy
      desert,
      And
      such
      a
      one
      as
      shall
      rejoice
      thy
      heart.
      For
      to
      the
      Cyclops
      too
      the
      gentle
      earth
      Bears
      generous
      wine,
      and
      Jove
      augments
      her
      birth,
      In
      store
      of
      such,
      with
      but
      this
      rich
      wine
      Fell
      from
      the
      river,
      that
      is
      mere
      divine,
      Of
      nectar
      and
      ambrosia.'
      This
      again
      I
      gave
      him,
      and
      again;
      nor
      could
      the
      fool
      abstain,
      But
      drunk
      as
      often.
      When
      the
      noble
      juice
      Had
      wrought
      upon
      his
      spirit,
      I
      then
      gave
      use
   
   
      And
      eat
      his
      fellows.
      Thou
      mightst
      know
      there
      were
      Some
      ills
      behind,
      rude
      swain,
      for
      thee
      to
      bear,
      That
      fear'd
      not
      to
      devour
      thy
      guests,
      and
      break
      All
      laws
      of
      humans.
      Jove
      sends
      therefore
      wreak,
      And
      all
      the
      Gods,
      by
      me.'
      This
      blew
      the
      more
      His
      burning
      fury;
      when
      the
      top
      he
      tore
   
   
      When
      now
      a
      weakling
      came,
      a
      dwarfy
      thing,
      A
      thing
      of
      nothing;
      
         who
         yet
         wit
         did
         bring,
      
      That
      brought
      supply
      to
      all,
      and
      with
      his
      wine
   
   
      Then
      flew
      fierce
      vows
      to
      Neptune,
      both
      his
      hands
      To
      star-born
      heaven
      cast:
      'O
      thou
      that
      all
      lands
      Gird'st
      in
      thy
      ambient
      circle,
      and
      in

      the
      curl'd
      tresses
      of
      thy
      sapphire
      hair,
      If
      I
      be
      thine,
      or
      thou
      mayst
      justly
      vaunt
      Thou
      art
      my
      father,
      hear
      me
      now,
      and
      grant
      That
      this
      Ulysses,
      old
      Laertes'
      son,
      That
      dwells

      Ithaca,
      and
      name
      hath
      won

      may
      never
      reach
      His
      natural
      region.
      Or
      if
      to
      fetch
   
   
      As
      gift
      from
      AEolus,
      and
      said:
      'O
      heaven!
      What
      grace
      and
      grave
      price
      is
      by
      all

      given
      To
      our

      Whatsoever
      coast
      Or
      town
      he
      comes
      to,
      how
      much
      he
      engrost
      Of
      fair
      and
      precious
      prey,
      and
      brought
      from
      Troy!
      We
      the
      same
      voyage
      went,
      and
      yet
      enjoy
      In
      our
      return
      these
      empty
      hands
      for
      all.
      This
      bag,
      now,
      AEolus
      was
      so
      liberal
   
   
      Your
      powers
      command
      it.'
      Thus
      endeavour'd
      I
      With
      soft
      speech
      to
      repair
      my
      misery.
      The
      rest
      with
      ruth
      sat
      dumb.
      But
      thus
      spake
      he:
      'Avaunt,
      and
      quickly
      quit
      my
      land
      of
      thee,
      Thou
      worst
      of
      all
      that
      breathe.
      It
      fits
      not
      me
      To
      convoy,
      and
      take
      in,
      whom
      Heavens
      expose.
      Away,
      and
      with
      thee
      go
      the
      worst
      of
      woes,
      That
      seek'st
      my
      friendship,
      and
      the
      Gods
      thy
      foes.'
      Thus
      he
      dismiss'd
      me
      sighing.
      Forth
      we
      sail'd,
   
   
      And
      yet
      would
      I
      no
      entry
      make,
      but
      stay'd
      Alone
      without
      the
      haven,
      and
      thence
      survey'd
      From
      out
      a
      lofty
      watch-tower
      raised
      there,
   
   
      And
      soothe
      their
      entries
      with
      their
      fawns
      and
      bounds,
      All
      guests
      still
      bringing
      some
      scraps
      for
      their
      hounds;
      So,
      on
      these
      men,
      the
      wolves
      and
      lions
      ramp'd,
      Their
      horrid
      paws
      set
      up.
      Their
      spirits
      were
      damp'd
      To
      see
      such
      
         monstrous
         kindness,
      
      stay'd
      at
      gate,
      And

      I
      replied,

      his
      smart
      I
      wept
      to
      see,
      and
      rued
      it
      from
      my
      heart,
      Enquiring
      how

      in

      the

      I
      excerpted.

      My

      To

      then
      each

      in
      a
      strait
      Of
      so
      much
      danger,
      much
      the
      better
      might
      Be
      hit
      by
      me,
      than
      others,
      as,
      provoked,
      I
      shifted
      place
      still,
      when,
      in
      some
      I
      smoked
      Both
      privy
      tremblings,
      and
      close
      vent
      of
      tears,
   
   
      This
      made
      the
      soul
      of
      swift
      Achilles
      tread
      A
      march
      of
      glory
      through
      the
      herby

      so
      renown
      his
      son;
      And
      vanish'd
      stalking.
      But
      with
      passion
   
   
      All
      this
      no
      word
      drew
      from
      him,
      but
      less
      near
      The
      stern
      soul
      kept;
      to
      other
      souls
      he
      fled,
      And
      glid
      along
      the
      river
      of
      the
      dead.
   
   
      Into
      his
      liver
      with
      their
      crooked
      beaks;

      each

      set
      on
      either
      side.
      Nor
      doth
      he
      ever
      labour
      to
      divide
      His
      liver
      and
      their
      beaks,
      nor
      with
      his
      hand
      Offer
      them
      off,
      but
      suffers
      by
      command
   
   
      The
      sweat
      came
      gushing
      out
      from
      every
      pore,
      And
      on
      his
      head
      a
      standing
      mist
      he
      wore,
      Reeking
      from
      thence,
      as
      if
      a
      cloud
      of
      dust
      Were
      raised
      about
      it.
      Down
      with
      these
      was
      thrust
   
   
      About
      him
      flew
      the
      clamours
      of
      the
      dead
      
      fowls,
      and
      still
      stoop'd
      cufling
      at
      his
      head.
      He
      with
      his
      bow,
      
      Night,
      stalk'd
      up
      and
      down,
      His
      shaft
      still
      nock'd
      and
      hurling
      round
      his
      frown
      At
      those
      vex'd
      hoverers,
      aiming
      at
      them
      still,
      And
      still,
      as
      shooting
      out,
      desire
      to
      still.

      I

      abhorred
      labours
      on
      my

      Of
      all
      which
      one
      was,
      to
      descend
      this
      strand,
      And
      hale
      the

      from
      thence.
      He

      not

      but
      before

      In

      venting
      sounds
      so
      rude,
      That
      pale
      Fear
      took
      me,

      By
      grim

      I
      therefore
      sent
      My
      men
      before

      I
      can

      at

      took,
      Up
      to

      went,
      and
      thence
      did
      look

      rocky
      Scylla
      would
      have
      first
      appear'd,
      And
      taken
      my
      life
      with
      the

      fear'd.

      we
      saw

      out,

      so
      much

      with
      all

      That
      he
      may
      sit
      to

      and
      rest
      his

      our
      convoy
      home
      of

      Whoever
      shall
      hereafter

         Turn'd
         to
         his
         country.
         Yet
         so
         wise
         a
         hand
         He
         carried,
         even
         of
         this
         joy,
         flown
         so
         high,
         That
         other
         end
         he
         put
         to
         his
         reply
      
      Than
      straight
      to
      show
      that
      joy,
      and
      lay
      abroad
      His
      life
      to
      strangers.
      Therefore
      he
      bestow'd
   
   
      A
      veil
      on
      truth;
      for
      evermore
      did
      wind
      About
      his

      a
      most
      crafty
      mind,
      Which
      thus
      his
      words
      show'd:
      "I

      But
      where
      you
      wonder

      not

      since
      thy

      therefore,
      truly
      to
      acknowledge
      thee

      Thee

      their

      but,
      since
      thy
      seeming
      view
      Appears

      But
      this
      I
      surely
      know,
      that,
      some
      years
      past,
      I
      have
      been
      often

      ate
      meat
      o'erflown
      With
      their
      own
      bloods,
      their
      eyes
      stood
      full
      of
      tears
      For
      violent
      joys;
      their
      souls
      yet
      thought
      of
      fears,
      Which
      Theoclymenus
      express'd,
      and
      said:
      "O
      wretches!
      Why
      Sustain
      ye,
      well
      apaid,
      Your
      imminent
      ill?
      A
      night,
      with
      which
      Death
      sees,
      Your
      heads
      and
      faces
      hides
      beneath
      your
      knees;
      Shrieks
      burn
      about
      you;
      your
      eyes
      thrust
      out
      tears;
      These
      fixed
      walls,
      and
      that
      main
      beam
      that
      bears
      The
      whole
      house
      up,
      in
      bloody
      torrents
      fall;
      The
      entry
      full
      of
      ghosts
      stands;
      full
      the
      hall
      Of
      passengers
      to
      hell;
      and
      under
      all
      The
      dismal
      shades;
      the
      sun
      sinks
      from
      the
      poles;
      And
      troubled
      air
      pours
      bane
      about
      your
      souls."
      They
      sweetly
      laugh'd
      at
      this.

      that

      Ulysses
      wore
      Cast

      He
      pour'd
      before
      his

      and
      thus
      made
      known
      His
      true
      state
      to
      the
      Wooers:
      "This

      Hath
      harmless
      been
      decided;
      now
      for

      rests
      another
      mark,
      more
      hard
      to

      And
      such
      as
      never
      man

      hath
      smit;
      Whose
      full
      point
      wise

      As
      he
      was
      lifting
      up
      the
      bowl,

      Death
      touch'd
      not
      at
      his
      thoughts
      at
      feast;
      for
      who
   
   
      But
      what
      their
      great
      Antinous
      began!
      He,
      frowning,
      said:
      "Dogs,

      in
      me
      the
      man
      Ye
      all
      held
      dead
      at

      This
      last
      word
      used,

      seized
      his
      weary
      eye
      That

      to
      all

      "O
      Queen,
      now
      satiate
      with
      afflictions
      laid
      On
      both
      our
      bosoms,--
      you
      oppressed
      here
      With
      cares
      for
      my
      return,
      I
      everywhere
      By
      Jove

      till
      all
      hope
      of
      my
      return
      was
      lost,--
      Aud
      both
      arrived
      at
      
         sweet
         haven,
         our

      opinion
      Gave
      thee
      for
      Jove's
      most

      since
      most
      command
      Of
      all
      the
      Greeks
      he
      gave
      thy
      eminent
      hand
      At
      siege
      of
      Ilion,
      where
      we
      suffer'd
      so.
      And
      is
      the
      issue
      this,
      that
      first
      in
      woe
      Stern
      Fate
      did
      therefore

      down?
      None
      borne

      I

      of
      all
      Our

      Fate
      had
      sign'd
      thy
      fall,
   
   
      And
      yet
      (which
      let
      not
      move
      you)
      you
      bestow
      N
      O
      care
      upon
      yourself,
      though
      to
      this
      show
      Of
      outward
      irksomeness
      to
      what
      you
      are
      You

      an

      More
      neat

      I

      no
