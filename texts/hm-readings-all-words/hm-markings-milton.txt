      The

      likest
      heaven
   
   
      In
      various
      shapes
      old
      Proteus
      from
      the
      sea,
   
   
      Saw
      within
      ken
      a
      glorious
      angel
      stand,
      The
      same
      whom
      John
      saw
      also
      in
      the
      sun:
   
   
      on
      some
      great
      charge
      employ'd
   
   
      And
      oft,
      though
      wisdom
      wake,
      suspicion
      sleeps
      At
      wisdom's
      gate,
      and
      to
      simplicity
      Resigns
      her
      charge,
      while
      goodness
      thinks
      no
      ill
   
   
      regent
      of
      the
      sun,
   
   
      Thus
      said,
      he
      turn'd,
      and
      Satan
      bowing
      low,
      As
      to
      superior
      spirits
      is
      wont
      in
      heaven,
      Where
      honour
      due
      and
      reverence
      none
      neglects,
      Took
      leave,
      and
      toward
      the
      coast
      of
      earth
      beneath,
      Down
      from
      th'
      ecliptic,
      sped
      with
      hop'd
      success,
      Throws
      his
      steep
      flight
      in
      many
      an
      aery
      wheel,
      Nor
      stay'd,
      till
      on

      lights.
   
   
      Be
      then
      his
      love
      accurs'd,
      since
      love
      or
      hate,
   
   
      To
      me
      alike,
      it
      deals
      eternal
      woe:
   
   
      In
      misery;
      such
      joy
      ambition
      finds.
      But
      say
      I
      could
      repent,
      and
      could
      obtain
      By
      act
      of
      grace
      my
      former
      state;
      how
      soon
      Would
      highth
      recal
      high
      thoughts,
      how
      soon
      unsay
      What
      feign'd
      submission
      swore:
      ease
      would
      recant
      Vows
      made
      in
      pain,
      as
      violent
      and
      void;
      For
      never
      can
      true
      reconcilement
      grow
      Where
      wounds
      of
      deadly
      hate
      have
      pierc'd
      so
      deep;
   
   
      Whom
      hunger
      drives
      to
      seek
      new
      haunt
      for

      Watching
      where

      In

      Led

      and
      leave
      No

      which
      gives

      With

      ornament;
      the

      pair
      Girt
      like

      with
      downy
      gold

      yesterday
      so
      late
      hath
      past
      the
      lips
   
   
      Now
      ere
      dim
      night
      had
      disincumber'd
      heaven,
      
         great
         hierarchal
         standard
      
      was
      to
      move;
   
   
      Tells
      the
      suggested
      cause,
      and
      casts
      between
      Ambiguous
      words
      and
      jealousies,
      to
      sound
      Or
      taint
      integrity:
      but
      all
      obey'd
      The
      wonted
      signal,
      and
      superior
      voice
   
   
      Equally
      free;
      for
      orders
      and
      degrees
      Jar
      not
      with
      liberty,
      but
      well
      consist.
   
   
      So
      spake
      the
      fervent
      angel;
      but
      his
      zeal
      None
      seconded,
      as
      out
      of
      season
      judg'd,
      Or
      singular
      and
      rash;
      whereat
      rejoic'd
   
   
      He
      said,
      and,
      as
      the
      sound
      of
      waters
      deep,
      Hoarse
      murmur
      echo'd
      to
      his
      words
      applause
      Through
      the
      infinite
      host;
      nor
      less
      for
      that
      The
      flaming
      seraph
      fearless,
      though
      alone
      Encompass'd
      round
      with
      foes,
      thus
      answer'd
      bold.
   
   
      So
      spake
      the
      seraph
      Abdiel
      faithful
      found,
   
   
      Among
      the
      faithless
      faithful
      only
      he:
      Among
      innumerable
      false
      unmov'd,
      Unshaken,
      unseduc'd,
      unterrify'd,
      His
      loyalty
      he
      kept,
      his
      love,
      his
      zeal;
      Nor
      number,
      nor
      example
      with
      him
      wrought
      To
      swerve
      from
      truth,
      or
      change
      his
      constant
      mind
      Though
      single.
      From
      amidst
      them
      forth
      he
      pass'd,
      Long
      way
      through
      hostile
      scorn,
      which
      he
      sustain'd
      Superior,
      nor
      of
      violence
      fear'd
      aught;
      And
      with
      retorted
      scorn
      his
      back
      he
      turn'd
   
   
      On
      those
      proud
      tow'rs
      to
      swift
      destruction
      doom'd.
   
   
      With
      joy
      and
      acclamations
      loud,
      that
      one,
      That
      of
      so
      many
      myriads
      fall'n
      yet
      one
      Return'd
      not
      lost.
      On
      to
      the
      sacred
      hill
   
   
      high
      applauded
   
   
      And
      for
      the
      testimony
      of
      truth
      hast
      borne
      Universal
      reproach,
      far
      worse
      to
      bear
      Than
      violence:
      for
      this
      was
      all
      thy
      care,
   
   
      To
      stand
      approv'd
      in
      sight
      of
      God,
      though
      worlds
      Judg'd
      thee
      perverse.
      The
      easier
      conquest
      now
   
   
      
         With
         furious
         expedition;
      
      for
      they
      ween'd
   
   
      Aspirer
   
   
      Twixt
      host
      and
      host
      but
      narrow
      space
      was
      left,
      
         
            
               A
               dreadful
               interval,
            
            and
            front
            to
            front
         
         Presented
         stood
         in
         terrible
         array
         Of
         hideous
         length:
         before
         the
         cloudy
         van,
         On
         the
         rough
         edge
         of
         battle
         ere
         it
         join'd,
         Satan,
         
            
            with
            vast
            and
            haughty
            strides
            advanc'd,
            Came
            towering,
            arm'd
            in
            adamant
            and
            gold:
         
         Abdiel
         that
         sight
         endur'd
         not,
         where
         he
         stood
      
      Among
      the
      mightiest,
      bent
      on
      highest
      deeds,
      And
      thus
      his
      own
      undaunted
      heart
      explores.
      O
      heaven!
      that
      such
      resemblance
      of
      the
      Highest
   
   
      Remain
      not;
      wherefore
      should
      not
      strength
      and
      might
   
   
      Victor:
      
         though
         brutish
         that
         contest
         and
         foul,
      
      When
      reason
      hath
      to
      deal
      with
      force,
      yet
      so
      Most
      reason
      is
      that
      reason
      overcome.
   
   
      
         Proud,
         art
         thou
         met?
      
      thy
      hope
      was
      to
      have
   
   
      To
      thee
      not
      visible,
      when
      I
      alone
      Seem'd
      in
      thy
      world
      erroneous
      to
      dissent
   
   
      How
      few
      sometimes
      may
      know,
      when
      thousands
      err.
   
   
      seditious
      angel
   
   
      Vigour
      divine
      within
      them,
      can
      allow
      Omnipotence
      to
      none.
      But
      well
      thou
      com'st
   
   
      the
      minstrelsy
      of
      heaven,
   
   
      Unjustly
      thou
      deprav'st
      it
      with
      the
      name
      Of
      servitude
      to
      serve
      whom
      God
      ordains,
      Or
      Nature;
      God
      and
      Nature
      bid
      the
      same,
   
   
      When
      he
      who
      rules
      is
      worthiest,
      and
      excels
      Them
      whom
      he
      governs.
      This
      is
      servitude,
      To
      serve
      th'
      unwise,
      or
      him
      who
      hath
      rebell'd
      Against
      his
      worthier,
      as
      thine
      now
      serve
      thee,
   
   
      Thy
      self
      not
      free,
      but
      to
      thy
      self
      enthrall'd;
      Yet
      leudly
      dar'st
      our
      minist'ring
      upbraid.
      Reign
      thou
      in
      hell
      thy
      kingdom,
      let
      me
      serve
      In
      heav'n
      God
      ever
      bless'd,
      and
      his
      divine
      Behests
      obey,
      worthiest
      to
      be
      obey'd;
      Yet
      chains
      in
      hell,
      not
      realms
      expect:
      mean
      while
      
         From
         me
         return'd,
         as
         erst
         thou
         saidst,
         from
         flight,
         This
         greeting
         on
         thy
         impious
         crest
         receive.
      
      So
      saying,
      a
      noble
      stroke
      he
      lifted
      high,
   
   
      He
      back
      recoil'd;
      the
      tenth
      on
      bended
      knee
      His
      massy
      spear
      upstay'd;
      as
      if
      on
      earth
      Winds
      under
      ground
      or
      waters,
      forcing
      way
      Side-long,
      had
      push'd
      a
      mountain
      from
      his
      seat,
      Half
      sunk
      with
      all
      his
      pines.
      Amazement
      seiz'd
      The
      rebel
      thrones,
      but
      greater
      rage
      to
      see
   
   
      The
      adversary.
      Nor
      think
      thou
      with
      wind
      Of
      aery
      threats
      to
      awe
      whom
      yet
      with
      deeds
   
   
      That
      thou
      shouldst
      hope,
      imperious,
      and
      with
      threats
      To
      chase
      me
      hence?
      err
      not
      that
      so
      shall
      end
      The
      strife
      which
      thou
      call'st
      evil,
      but
      we
      style
      The
      strife
      of
      glory:
      which
      we
      mean
      to
      win,
      Or
      turn
      this
      heaven
      itself
      into
      the
      hell
      Thou
      fablest
      here
      however
      to
      dwell
      free,
      If
      not
      to
      reign:
      meanwhile
      thy
      utmost
      force,
   
   
      And
      left
      large
      field,
      unsafe
      
         
         within
         the
         wind
         Of
         such
         commotion
      
      such
      as,
      to
      set
      forth
   
   
      Cannot
      but
      by
      annihilating
      die;
   
   
      And
      with
      fierce
      ensigns
      pierc'd
      the
      deep
      array
      Of
      Moloc
      furious
      king,
      who
      him
      defy'd,
      And
      at
      his
      chariot
      wheels
      to
      drag
      him
      bound
      Threaten'd,
      nor
      from
      the
      Holy
      One
      of
      heav'n
      Refrain'd
      his
      tongue
      blasphemous;
      but
      anon,
      Down
      cloven
      to
      the
      waist,
      with
      shatter'd
      arms
      And
      uncouth
      pain
      fled
      bellowing.
      On
      each
      wing
   
   
      Uriel
      and
      Raphael
      his
      vaunting
      foe,
      Though
      huge,
      and
      in
      a
      rock
      of
      diamond
      arm'd
      Vanquish'd,
      Adramelec
      and
      Asmadai,
      Two
      potent
      thrones,
      that
      to
      be
      less
      than
      gods
      Disdain'd,
      but
      meaner
      thoughts
      learn'd
      in
      their
      flight,
      Mangled
      with
      ghastly
      wounds
      thro'
      plate
      and
      mail.
      Nor
      stood
      unmindful
      Abdiel
      to
      annoy
      The
      atheist
      crew,
      but
      with
      redoubled
      blow
      Ariel,
      and
      Arioc,
      and
      the
      violence
      Of
      Ramiel
      scorch'd
      and
      blasted,
      overthrew.
      I
      might
      relate
      of
      thousands,
      and
      their
      names
      Eternize
      here
      on
      earth;
      but
      those
      elect
      Angels,
      contented
      with
      their
      fame
      in
      heaven,
   
   
      
         Seek
         not
         the
         praise
         of
         men:
         the
         other
         sort,
      
      In
      might
      though
      wondrous
      and
      in
      acts
      of
      war,
      Nor
      of
      renown
      less
      eager,
      yet
      by
      doom
      Cancel'd
      from

      from

      Of

      taught

      live
      The
      easiest
      way,
      nor
      with
      perplexing
      thoughts
   
   
      To
      interrupt
      the
      sweet
      of

      from
      which
      God
      hath
      bid
      dwell
      far
      off
      all
      anxious
      cares,

      them
      with
      wand'ring

      and

      Till
      warn'd,
      or
      by

         That

      feel
      that
      I
      am
      happier
      than
      I
      know.
   
   
      What
      happiness,
      
         who
         can
         enjoy
         alone,
      
   
   
      And
      these
      inferior
      far
      beneath
      me
      set?
      Among
      unequals
      what
      society
      Can
      sort,
      what
      harmony,
      or
      true
      delight?
      Which
      must
      be
      mutual,
      in
      proportion
      due,
      Giv'n
      and
      receiv'd;
      but
      in
      disparity,
      The
      one
      intense,
      the
      other
      still
      remiss,
      Cannot
      well
      suit
      with
      either,
      but
      soon
      prove
      Tedious
      alike:
      of
      fellowship
      I
      speak
      Such
      as
      I
      seek,
      fit
      to
      participate
      All
      rational
      delight,
      wherein
      the
      brute
      Cannot
      be
      human
      consort:
      they
      rejoice
      Each
      with
      their
      kind,
      lion
      with
      lioness;
      So
      fitly
      them
      in
      pairs
      thou
      hast
      combin'd;
   
   
      
         A
         nice
         and
         subtile
         happiness
         I
         see
      
      Thou
      to

      taste
      No
      pleasure,
      though
      in
      pleasure,
      solitary.
   
   
      What
      think'st
      thou
      then
      of
      me,
      and
      this
      my

      Seem

      to
      thee
      sufficiently
      possest
      Of
      happiness,
      or
      not,
      who

      Let

      for
      smiles
      from
      reason
      flow,
   
   
      For
      not
      to
      irksome
      toil,
      but
      to
      delight,
      He
      made
      us,
      and
      delight
      to
      reason
      join'd.
   
   
      For
      solitude
      sometimes
      is
      best
      society,
   
   
      th'
      attempt

      intended
      by
      our
      foe:
      For
      he
      who
      tempts,
      though
      in
      vain,
      at
      least
      asperses
      The
      tempted
      with
      dishonour
      foul,
      suppos'd
      Not
      incorruptible
      of
      faith,
      not
      proof
   
   
      If
      this
      be
      our
      condition,
      thus
      to
      dwell
      In
      narrow
      circuit
      straiten'd


straiten'd
      by
      a
      foe,
      Subtle
      or
      violent,
      we
      not
      endu'd
      Single
      with
      like
      defence,
      wherever
      met,
      How
      are
      we
      happy,
      still
      in
      fear
      of
      harm?
   
   
      Wouldst
      thou
      approve
      thy
      constancy,
      approve
      First
      thy

      th'
      other

      Not

      thee
      attempted,
      who
      attest?
   
   
      So
      spake
      the
      patriarch
      of
      mankind,
      but
      Eve
      Persisted,
      yet
      submiss,
      though
      last,
      reply'd.
   
   
      Much
      he
      the
      place
      admir'd,
      the
      person
      more.
      As
      one
      who
      long
      in
      populous
      city
      pent
      Where
      houses
      thick

      Forth
      issuing
      on
      a

      farms
      Adjoin'd,
      from
      each

      met
      conceives
      delight;
      The
      smell
      of
      grain,
      or
      tedded
      grass,
      or
      kine,
      Or
      dairy,
      each
      rural
      sight,
      each
      rural
      sound;
      If
      chance
      with
      nymph-like
      step
      fair

      pass,
   
   
      
         Stupidly
         good,
      
      of
      enmity
      disarm'd,
      Of
      guile,
      of
      hate,
      of
      envy,
      of
      revenge;
      But
      the
      hot
      Hell
      that
      always
      in
      him
      burns,
      Though
      in
      mid
      Heaven,
      soon
      ended
      his
      delight,
      And
      tortures
      him
      now
      more,
      the
      more
      he
      sees
      Of
      pleasure
      not
      for

      ordain'd:
      then
      soon
      Fierce
      hate
      he
      recollects,
      and
      all
      his
      thoughts
      Of
      mischief,
      gratulating,
      thus
      excites.
      Thoughts,
      whither
      have
      ye
      led
      me!
      with
      what
   
   
      And
      life
      more
      perfect
      have
      attain'd

      Not

      Why

      Eve
      with

      her

      would
      seek
      to
      free
      These
      thus
      degenerate,
      by
      themselves
      enslav'd,
      Or
      could
      of
      inward
      slaves
      make
      outward
      free?
   
   
      Though
      sons
      of
      God
      both
      angels
      are
      and
      men,
   
   
      
      the
      childhood
      shows
      the
      man,
      As
      morning
      shows
      the
      day.
   
   
      All
      knowledge
      is
      not
      couch'd
      in
      Moses'
      law,
      The
      Pentateuch,
      or
      what
      the
      prophets
      wrote;
      The
      Gentiles
      also
      know,
      and
      write,
      and
      teach
      To
      admiration,
      led
      by
      nature's
      light;
      And
      with
      the
      Gentiles
      much
      thou
      must
      converse,
      Ruling
      them
      by
      persuasion
      as
      thou
      mean'st;
      Without
      their
      learning
      how
      wilt
      thou
      with
      them,
      Or
      they
      with
      thee,
      hold
      conversation
      meet?
      How
      wilt
      thou
      reason
      with
      them?
      how
      refute
      Their
      idolisms,
      traditions,
      paradoxes?
      Error
      by
      his

      is
      best
      evinc'd.

      warbling
      charms
      No

      their

      So
      much
      of
      adder's
      wisdom
      I
      have
      learnt
      To
      fence

      against
      thy

honour'd,

         Thy

         me
         now,

         Deceivable,
         in
         most
         things
         as
         a
         child
      
      Helpless,
      thence
      easily
      contemn'd,
      and
      scorn'd,
      And
      last
      neglected?
      how
      would'st
      thou
      insult,
      When
      I
      must
      live
      uxorious
      to
      thy
      will
      In
      perfect
      thraldom,
      how
      again
      betray
      me,
      Bearing
      my
      words
      and
      doings
      to
      the

      To

      My

      and
      ancient

      And
      if
      your
      stray-attendants
      be
      yet
      lodg'd
   
   
      And
      the

      breast,
      May

      and
      enjoy
      bright
      day:
      But
      he
      that
      hides
      a
      dark
      soul,
      and
      foul
      thoughts,
      Benighted
      walks
      under
      the
      mid-day
      sun;
      Himself
      is
      his
      own
      dungeon.
   
   
      She
      that

      Will
      dare
      to
      soil
      her
      virgin
      purity:
      Yea
      there,
      where
      very
      desolation
      dwells,
      By
      grots,
      and
      caverns
      shagg'd
      with
      horrid
      shades,
      She
      may
      pass
      on
      with
      unblench'd
      majesty,
      Be
      it
      not
      done
      in
      pride,
      or
      in
      presumption.
      Some
      say
      no
      evil
      thing
      that
      walks
      by
      night,
      In
      fog,
      or
      fire,
      by
      lake,
      or
      moorish
      fen,
      Blue
      meager
      hag,
      or
      stubborn
      unlaid
      ghost,
      That
      breaks
      his
      magic
      chains
      at
      curfew
      time,
      No
      goblin,
      or
      swart
      faery
      of
      the
      mine,
      Hath
      hurtful
      power
      o'er
      true
      virginity.
      Do
      ye
      believe
      me
      yet,
      or
      shall
      I
      call
      Antiquity
      from
      the
      old
      schools
      of
      Greece
      To
      testify
      the
      arms
      of
      chastity?
   
   
      What
      was
      that
      snaky-headed
      Gorgon
      shield,
      That
      wise
      Minerva
      wore,
      unconquer'd
      virgin,
      Wherewith
      she
      freez'd
      her
      foes
      to
      congeal'd
      stone,
   
   
      But
      rigid
      looks
      of
      chaste
      austerity,
   
   
      So
      dear
      to
      heav'n
      is
      saintly
      chastity,
      That
      when
      a
      soul
      is
      found
      sincerely
      so,
      A
      thousand
      liveried
      angels
      lacky
      her,
      Driving
      far
      off
      each
      thing
      of
      sin
      and
      guilt,
      And
      in
      clear
      dream,
      and
      solemn
      vision,
      Tell
      her
      of
      things
      that
      no
      gross
      ear
      can
      hear,
      
         Till
         oft
         converse
         with
         heav'nly
         habitants
         Begin
         to
         cast
         a
         beam
         on
         th'
         outward
         shape,
         The
         unpolluted
         temple
         of
         the
         mind,
      
      And
      turns
      it
      by
      degrees
      to
      the
      soul's
      essence,
      Till
      all
      be
      made
      immortal:
      but
      when
      lust,
      By
      unchaste
      looks,
      loose
      gestures,
      and
      foul
      talk,
      But
      most
      by
      lewd
      and
      lavish
      act
      of
      sin,
      Lets
      in
      defilement
      to
      the
      inward
      parts,
      The
      soul
      grows
      clotted
      by
      contagion,
      Imbodies,
      and
      imbrutes,
      Till
      she
      quite
      lose
      The
      divine
      property
      of
      her
      first
      being.
      Such
      are
      those
      thick
      and
      gloomy
      shadows
      damp
      Oft
      seen
      in
      charnel
      vaults,
      and
      sepulchres,
      Ling'ring
      and
      sitting
      by
      a
      new
      made
      grave,
      As
      loath
      to
      leave
      the
      body
      that
      it
      lov'd,

      How
      charming
      is
      divine
      philosophy!
      Not
      harsh,
      and
      crabbed,
      as
      dull
      fools
      suppose,
      But
      musical
      as
      is
      Apollo's
      lute,
      And
      a
      perpetual
      feast
      of
      nectar'd
      sweets,
      Where
      no
      crude
      surfeit
      reigns.
   
   
      Either
      some
      one
      like
      us
      night-founder'd
      here,
   
   
      That
      brow
      this

      whence,
      night
      by

      At
      last
      a
      soft
      and
      solemn-breathing
      sound
      Rose
      like
      a
      steam
      of
      rich
      distill'd
      perfumes,
   
   
      And
      took
      in
      strains
      that

      create
      a

      Under

      of

      Virtue
      may
      be
      assail'd,

      The

      O

      of

      that

      Wherefore
      did
      Nature

      forth,
      With
      such
      a

      Covering
      the

      all
      to
      please,
      and
      sate
      the

      The

      their

      Many
      a

      Bitter
      constraint,
      and
      sad
      occasion
      dear,
      Compels
      me
      to
      disturb
      your
      season
      due:
      For
      Lycidas
      is
      dead,
      dead
      ere
      his
      prime,
      Young
      Lycidas,
      and
      hath
      not
      left
      his
      peer:
   
   
      Who
      would
      not
      sing
      for
      Lycidas?
      He
      knew
      
         Himself
         to
         sing,
         
            and
            build
            the
            lofty
            rhime.
         
      
   
   
      strictly
      meditate
   
   
      (That
      last
      infirmity
      of
      noble

      and
      intrude,
      and
      climb
      into
      the
      fold?
      Of
      other
      care
      they
      little
      reckoning
      make,
      Than
      how
      to
      scramble
      at
      the
      shearer's
      feast,
      And
      shove
      away
      the
      worthy
      bidden
      guest;
      [hold
      Blind
      mouths!
      that
      scarce
      themselves
      know
      how
      to
      A
      sheep-hook,
      or

      learn'd
      aught
      else
      the

      That
      to
      the

      belongs!
      What
      recks
      it
      them?
      What
      need
      they?
      They
      are
      sped;
      And
      when
      they
      list,
      their
      lean
      and
      flashy
      songs
      Grate
      on
      their
      scrannel
      pipes
      of
      wretched
      straw;
      The
      hungry
      sheep
      look
      up,
      and
      are
      not
      fed,
      But
      swoln
      with
      wind,
      and
      the
      rank
      mist
      they
      draw,
      Rot
      inwardly,
      and
      foul
      contagion
      spread;
      Besides
      what
      the
      grim
      wolf
      with
      privy
      paw
      Daily
      devours
      apace,
      and
      nothing
      said;
      But
      that
      two-handed
      engine
      at
      the

      Stands
      ready
      to
      smite
      once,
      and
      smite
      no
      more.
   
   
      Mark
      the

      effect
      of

      of

      Where
      more

      And
      every

      tells
      his

      the
      nibbling
      flocks
      do
      stray,
      Mountains,
      on
      Whose

      Or
      sweetest
      Shakespeare,
      Fancy's
      child,
      Warble
      his

      wood-notes
      wild.
   
   
      While
      birds
      of
      calm

      run
      back,

      fetch
      the
      age
      of
      gold;
   
   
      The
      oracles
      are
      dumb,
      No

      lonely

      shore,
      A

      of
      weeping
      heard
      and
      loud
      lament;
      From
      haunted
      spring,

      The
      parting

      with
      sighing

      With

      tresses
      torn
      The
      Nymphs
      in
      twilight
      shade

      To

      life
   
   
      Toward
      solid
      good
      what

      the

      though
      wise
      in
      show,
      That
      with
      superfluous
      burden
      loads
      the
      day,
      And,
      when
      God
      sends
      a
      cheerful
      hour,
      refrains.
