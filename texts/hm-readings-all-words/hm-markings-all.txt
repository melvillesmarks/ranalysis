   
      Flow
      in
      thy
      nerves,
      God
      gave
      thee
      it;
      and
      so
      'tis
      not
      thine
      own,
      But
      in
      his
      hands
      still.
      What
      then
      lifts
      thy
      pride
      in
      this
      so
      high?
   
   
      Bristled
      his
      bosom,
      and
      two
      ways
      drew
      his
      discursive
      part;
      If,
      from
      his
      thigh
      his
      sharp
      sword
      drawn,
      he
      should
      make
      room
      about
      Atrides'
      person,
      slaught'ring
      him,
      or
      sit
      his
      anger
      out,
      And
      curb
      his
      spirit.
      While
      these
      thoughts
      striv'd
      in
      his
      blood
      and
      mind,
   
   
      Achilles
      by
      the
      yellow
      curls,
      and
      only
      gave
      her
      look
      To
      him;
      appearance
      not
      a
      man
      of
      all
      the
      rest
      could
      see.
   
   
      Stand
      heartily
      inclin'd
      to
      both.
      Come,
      give
      us
      both
      respects,
      And
      cease
      contention;
      
         draw
         no
         sword;
         use
         words,
      
      and
      such
      as
      may
   
   
      Be
      bitter
      to
      his
      pride,
      but
      just;
   
   
      So
      old
      as
      I.
      I
      liv'd
      long
      since,
      and
      was
      companion
      With
      men
      superior
      to
      you
      both,
      who
      yet
      would
      ever
      hear
      My
      counsels
      with
      respect.
      Mine
      eyes
      yet
      never
      witness
      were,
      Nor
      ever
      will
      be,
      of
      such
      men
      as
      then
      delighted
      them;

      Exadius,
      and
      god-
      Polypheme,
      Caneus,
      and
      Dryas
      prince
      of

      Theseus,
      A

      heaven's
      immortals
      form'd;
      all,
      all
      most
      vigorous,
   
   
      Since
      they
      mine
      honour.
      But
      your
      king,
      in
      tempting
      mischief,
      raves,
      Nor
      sees
      at
      once
      by
      present
      things
      the
      future;
      how
      
      waves
      Ills
      follow
      ills;
      injustices
      being
      never

      after-plagues
      even
      then

      seen
      as
      sure;
      Which
      yet
      he
      sees
      not,
      and
      so
      soothes
      his
      present
      lust,
      which
      check'd,
      Would
      check
      plagues
      future;

      succouring
      right,
      protect
   
   
      Made
      to
      his
      mother:
      "Mother!
      Since
      you

      me
      forth
      to
      breathe
      So
      short
      a

      Olympius

      his

      sate
      by

      said:
   
   
      Her

      she
      pour'd
      out
      in
      tears:
      "O

      my

      said
      she,
      "Why
      brought
      I
      up
      thy
      being
      at
      all,
      that

      without

      And
      tears
      perform

      But
      to

      thrall
      to
      so
      stern
      a

      As

      But
      what
      thou
      wishest
      now,
      If
      Jove
      will
      grant,
      I'll
      up
      and
      ask;
      Olympus
      crown'd
      with

      And
      hurl'd
      me
      out
      of
      heaven.
      All
      day
      I
      was
      in
      falling
      down;
      At
      length
      in
      Lemnos
      I
      struck
      earth.
      The

      And
      I,
      together,
      set;
      my
      life
      almost
      set
      too;
      yet
      there
      The
      Sintii
      cheer'd
      and
      took

      This
      did

      laughter
      cheer
   
   
      Nectar
      to
      all
      the
      other
      Gods.
      A
      laughter
      never
      left
      Shook
      all
      the
      blessed
      deities,
      to
      see
      the
      lame
      so
      deft
   
   
      the

      rapture
      is

      of

      to
      dissent,
      of

      or
      singularity)
      I
      am
      bound,
      by
      this
      brief
      comment,
      to
      show
      I
      understand
      how
      all
      other

      characters,
      which
      not
      understood,
      how
      are
      their
      speeches,
      being
      one
      by
      another
      as
      conveniently
      and
      necessarily
      known
      as
      the
      instrument
      by
      the
      sound?
      If
      a
      translator
      or
      interpreter
      of
      a
      ridiculous
      and
      cowardly-described
      person
      (being
      deceived
      in
      his
      character)
      so
   
   
      dream,
      and
      dreaming
      still,
      awake,
   
   
      Swarms
      rise
      out
      of
      a
      hollow
      rock,
      repairing
      the
      degrees
      Of
      their
      egression
      endlessly,
      with
      ever
      rising
      new
      From
      forth
      their
      sweet
      nest;
      as
      their
      store,
      still
      as
      it
      faded,
      grew,
      And
      never
      would
      cease
      sending
      forth
      her
      clusters
      to
      the
      spring,
      They
      still
      crowd
      out
      so;
      this
      flock
      here,
      that
      there,
      belabouring
      The
      loaded
      flowers;
      so
      from
      the
      ships
      and
      tents
      the
      army's
      store
      Troop'd
      to
      these
      princes,
      and
      the
      court,
      along
      th'
      unmeasur'd
      shore;
      Amongst
      whom,
      Jove's
      ambassadress,
      Fame,
      in
      her
      virtue
      shin'd,

      footsteps
      from
      so
      many
      towns;
      
         
         because
         his
         power
         is
         most,
         He
         will
         destroy
         most.
      
      But
      how
      vile
      such
      and
      so
      great
      an
      host
   
   
      But
      Jove
      hath
      
         
         order'd
         I
         should
         grieve,
         and
         to
         that
         end
         hath
         cast
         My

         past
         end.
      
      Myself,
      and
      Thetis'
      son,
   
   
      
      Jove
      heard
      him
      not,
      but
      made
      more
      plentiful
      the
      birth
      Of
      his
      sad
      toils,
      yet
      took
      his
      gifts.

      being

      laid
      by
      a
      man,
      that
      which
      he
      addeth
      is
      only
      
         the
         work
         of
         a
         woman,

         netify

      breath
      In
      strength
      of
      far-resounding
      blows,
   
   
      Then
      (seeing
      Ulysses
      next)
      he
      said:
      "Lov'd
      daughter,
      what
      is
      he
      That,
      lower
      than

      in
      his
      shoulders
      and
      big

      presents
      a
      broader
      show?
      His
      armour
      lies
      upon
      the
      earth;
      he
      up
      and
      down
      doth

      their
      arms,
      If,
      in
      this
      truce,
      they
      should
      be
      tried

      For
      when
      the
      Trojan
      council
      met,
      and
      these
      together
      
         stood

         set,
      
      Ulysses
      did
      
         exceed,

      bred

      If

      years
      now
      give
      me;
      and
      now
      years
      want
      that
      main
      strength
      of

      But
      show'd

      a

      Rude
      Mars
      had
      th'
      ordering
      of
      their
      spirits;
      of
      Greeks,
      the
      learned
      Maid.
      But
      Terror
      follow'd
      both
      the
      hosts,
      and
      Flight,
      and
      furious
      Strife
      (The
      sister,
      and
      the
      mate,
      of
      Mars)
      that
      spoil
      of
      human

      And
      never

      her
      rage
      at
      rest,
      at
      first
      she

      small,
   
   
      That,
      while
      her
      feet
      move
      here
      in
      earth,
      her
      forehead
      is
      in
      heaven;
      And
      this
      was
      she
      that
      made
      even
      then
      both
      hosts
      so
      deadly
      given.
      Through
      every
      troop
      she
      stalk'd,
      and
      stirr'd
      rough
      sighs
      up
      as
      she
      went;
      But
      when
      in
      one
      field
      both
      the
      foes
      her
      fury
      did
      content,
      And
      both
      came
      under
      reach
      of
      darts,
      then
      darts
      and
      shields
      oppos'd
      To
      darts
      and
      shields;
      strength
      answer'd
      strength;
      then
      swords
      and
      targets
      clos'd
      With
      swords
      and
      targets;
      both
      with
      pikes;
      and
      then
      did
      tumult
      rise
   
   
      Of
      silver
      Simois,
      to
      see
      her
      parents'
      flocks,
      with
      them
      She,
      feeling
      suddenly
      the
      pains
      of
      child-birth,
      by
      the
      stream
      Of
      that
      bright
      river
      brought
      him
      forth;
      and
      so
      (of
      Simois)
      They
      call'd
      him
      Simoisius.
      Sweet
      was
      that
      birth
      of
      his
      To
      his
      kind
      parents,
      and
      his
      growth
      did
      all
      their
      care
      employ;
      And
      yet
      those
      rites
      of
      piety,
      that
      should
      have
      been
      his
      joy
      To
      pay
      their
      honour'd
      years
      again
      in
      as
      affectionate
      sort,
      He
      could
      not
      graciously
      perform,
      his
      sweet
      life
      was
      so
      short,
   
   
      She
      gave
      it,
      marching
      in
      the
      midst.
      
         
         Then
         flew
         the
         fatal
         hour
      
      Back
      on
      Diores,
   
   
      It
      took
      his
      forward-turned
      back,
      and
      look'd
      out
      of
      his
      breast;
      His
      huge
      trunk
      sounded,
      and
      his
      arms
      did
      echo
      the
      resound.
   
   
      His
      body's
      ruin,
      and
      his
      arms,
      so
      sounded
      in
      his
      fall,
      That
      his
      affrighted
      horse
      flew
      off,
      and
      left
      him,
      
      his
      life.
   
   
      As
      tenderly
      as
      those
      she
      lov'd.
      Phylides
      near
      him
      stept,
      And
      in
      the
      fountain
      of
      his
      nerves
      did
      drench
      his
      fervent
      lance,
      At
      his
      head's
      back-part;
      and
      so
      far
      the
      sharp
      head
      did
      advance,
      It
      cleft
      the
      organ
      of
      his
      speech,
      and
      th'
      iron,
      cold
      as
      death,
      He
      took
      betwixt
      his
      grinning
      teeth,
      and
      gave
      the
      air
      his
      breath.
   
   
      To
      heir
      his
      goods,
      yet
      Diomed
      took
      both,
      and
      left
      him
      store
      Of
      tears
      and
      sorrows
      in
      their
      steads,
      since
      he
      could
      never
      see
      His
      sons
      leave
      those
      hot
      wars
      alive;
      so
      this
      the
      end
      must
      be
      Of
      all
      his
      labours;
      what
      he
      heap'd
      to
      make
      his
      issue
      great
      Authority
      heir'd,
      and
      with
      her
      seed
      fill'd
      his
      forgotten
      seat.
   
   
      
      Authority
      heir'd--
      The
      word
      that
      Chapman
      here
      translates
      authority
      is
      in
   
   
      Blood,
      such
      as
      flows
      in
      blessed
      Gods,
      that
      eat
      no
      human
      food,
      Nor
      drink
      of
      our
      inflaming
      wine,
      and
      therefore
      bloodless
      are,
      And
      call'd
      Immortals;
      out
      she
      cried,
      and
      could
      no
      longer
      bear
   
   
      I

      from
      his
      bloody
      hand.
      Now
      battle
      is
      not
      given
      To
      any
      Trojans
      by
      the
      Greeks,
      but
      by
      the
      Greeks
      to
      heaven."
      She
      answer'd:
      "Daughter,
      think
      not
      much,
      though
      much
      it
      grieve
   
   
      And
      he
      by
      stealth
      enfranchis'd
      him;
      though
      he
      could
      scarce
      enjoy
      The
      benefit
      of
      franchisement,
      the
      chains
      did
      so
      destroy
      His
      vital
      forces
      with
      their
      weight.
      So
      Juno
      suffer'd
      more
   
   
      Not
      knowing
      he
      that
      fights
      with
      Heaven
      hath
      never
      long
      to
      live,
   
   
      Strength-trusting
      man,
      though
      thou
      be
      strong,
      and
      art
      in
      strength
      a
      tower,
      Take
      heed
      a
      stronger
      meet
      thee
      not,
      and
      that
      a
      woman's
      power
      Contains
      not
      that
      superior
      strength,
      and
      lest
      that
      woman
      be
   
   
      And
      ask'd
      him:
      "What!
      Not
      yield
      to
      gods?
      Thy
      equals
      learn
      to
      know.
      The
      race
      of
      Gods
      is
      far
      above
      men
      creeping
      here
      below."
   
   
      This
      stung
      great
      Hector's
      heart;
      and
      yet,
      as
      every
      generous
      mind
      Should
      silent
      bear
      a
      just
      reproof,
      and
      show
      what
      good
      they
      find
      In
      worthy
      counsels,
      by
      their
      ends
      put
      into
      present
      deeds,
      Not
      stomach
      nor
      be
      vainly
      sham'd,
      so
      Hector's
      spirit
      proceeds,
   
   
      Then
      with
      the
      feet
      of
      horse
      and
      foot
      the
      dust
      in
      clouds
      did
      rise;
      And
      as,
      in
      sacred
      floors
      of
      barns,
      upon
      corn-winnowers
      flies
      The
      chaff,
      driven
      with
      an
      opposite
      wind,
      when
      yellow
      Ceres
      dites,
      Which
      all
      the
      diters'
      feet,
      legs,
      arms,
      their
      heads
      and
      shoulders
      whites,
      So
      look'd
      the
      Grecians
      grey
      with
      dust,
      that
      struck
      the
      solid
      heaven,
      Rais'd
      from
      returning
      chariots,
      and
      troops
      together
      driven.
      Each
      side
      stood
      to
      their
      labours
      firm.
      Fierce
      Mars
      flew
      through
      the
      air,
   
   
      "O
      friends,"
      said
      he,
      "hold
      up
      your
      minds;
      
         
         strength
         is
         but
         strength
         of
         will;
      
   
   
      Began
      as
      if
      he
      had
      her
      pow'r,
      and
      show'd
      
         
         the
         mortal
         state
         Of
         too
         much
         confidence
         in
         man,
      
      with
      this
      superfluous
      brave:
   
   
      And
      what
      he
      threaten'd,
      th'
      other
      gave,
      that
      darkness,
      and
      that
      hell.
   
   
      Tydeus
      exampled
      not
      himself
      in
      thee
      his
      son;
      not
      great,
      But
      yet
      he
      was
      a
      soldier;
      a
      man
      of
      so
      much
      heat,
      That
      in
      his
      embassy
      for
      Thebes,
      when
      I
      forbad
      his
      mind
      To
      be
      too
      vent'rous,
      and
      when
      feasts
      his
      heart
      might
      have
      declin'd,
      With
      which
      they
      welcom'd
      him,
      he
      made
      a
      challenge
      to
      the
      best,
      And
      foil'd
      the
      best;
      I
      gave
      him
      aid,
      because
      the
      rust
      of
      rest,
      That
      would
      have
      seiz'd
      another
      mind,
      he
      suffer'd
      not,
      but
      us'd
      The
      trial
      I
      made
      
      a
      man,
      and
      their
      soft
      feasts
      refus'd.
      Yet,
      when
      I
      set
      thee
      on,
      thou
      faint'st;
      I
      guard
      thee,
      charge,
      exhort
      That,
      I
      abetting
      thee,
      thou
      shouldst
      be
      
         
         to
         the
         Greeks
         a
         fort,
         And
         a
         dismay
         to
         Ilion,
      
      yet
      thou
      obey'st
      in
      nought,
      Afraid,
      or
      slothful,
      or
      else
      both;
      henceforth
      renounce
      all
      thought
      That
      ever
      thou
      wert
      Tydeus'
      son."
      He
      answer'd
      her:
      "I
      know
      Thou
      art
      Jove's
      daughter,
      and,
      for
      that,
      in
      all
      just
      duty
      owe
      Thy
      speeches
      reverence,
      yet
      affirm
      ingenuously
      that
      fear
   
   
      With
      note
      and
      reverence
      of
      your
      charge."
      "My
      dearest
      mind,"
      said
      she,
      "What
      then
      was
      fit
      is
      chang'd.
      'Tis
      true,

      But
      just

      otherwise
      he
      raves,
      not
      fights.
      He's
      alter'd
      far.
   
   
      In

      He
      had
      of
      wealth
      a
      well,
      And
      yet
      was
      kind
      and
      bountiful,

      would
      a
      traveller

      To
      be
      his
      guest,
      his

      in
      the
      broad

      In
      which
      he
      all
      sorts
      nobly
      us'd,
      yet
      none
      of
      them
      would
      stand
      'Twixt
      him
      and
      death,

      Nourish

      Come

      The
      race
      of
      man
      is,
      that
      deserves
      no
      question;
      nor
      receives
      My
      being
      any
      other
      breath?
      The
      wind
      in
      autumn
      strows
      The
      earth
      with
      old
      leaves,
      then
      the
      spring
      the
      woods

      And
      so
      death
      scatters
      men
      on
      earth,
      so
      life
      puts
      out
      again

      particular

      this,
      to
      many
      known:
      In
      midst
      of
      Argos,
      nurse
      of
      horse,
      there
      stands
      a
      walled
      town,
      Ephyre,
      where
      the
      mansion-house
      of
      Sisyphus
      did
      stand,
   
   
      The

      plac'd

      the

      She
      herself
      descended,

      search'd
      out,
      Within
      a
      place
      that
      breath'd
      perfumes,
      the
      richest
      robe
      she
      had;
      Which
      lay
      with
      many
      rich
      ones
      more,
      most
      curiously
      made
      By
      women
      of
      Sidonia,
      which
      Paris
      brought
      from
      thence,
      Sailing
      the
      broad
      sea,
      when
      he
      made
      that
      voyage
      of
      offence
      In
      which
      he
      brought
      home
      Helena.
      That
      robe
      transferr'd
      so
      far
      (That
      was
      the
      undermost)
      she
      took;
      it
      glitter'd
      
      a
      star;
   
   
      the
      brazen
      head
      went
      shining
      in
      before,
   
   
      But
      he
      is
      senseless,
      
         nor
         conceives
         what
         any
         manhood
         is,
      
   
   
      Her
      son,
      borne
      in
      his
      nurse's
      arms;
      when,
      
      a
      heavenly
      sign,
      Compact
      of
      many
      golden
      stars,
      the
      princely
      child
      did
      shine,

      survives
   
   
      Thou
      amply

      joy,
   
   
      Into
      their
      wits,
      or
      courages."
      To
      this,
      great
      Hector
      said:
      
         "Be
         well
         assured,
         wife,
         all
         these
         things
         in
         my
         kind
         cares
         are
         weighed.
      
      But
      what
      a
      shame,
      and
      fear,
      it
      is
      to
      think
      how
      Troy
      would
      scorn
      (Both
      in
      her
      husbands
      and
      her
      wives,
      whom
      long-train'd
      gowns
      adorn)
      That
      I
      should
      cowardly
      fly
      off!
      The
      spirit!
      first
      did
      breath
      Did
      never
      teach
      me
      that;
      much
      less,
      
         
         since
         the
         contempt
         of
         death
         Was
         settled
         in
         me,
      
      and
      my
      mind
      knew
      what
      a
      worthy
      was
      Whose
      office
      is
      to
      lead
      in
      fight,
      and
      give
      no
      danger
      pass
      Without
      improvement.
      In
      this
      fire
      must
      Hector's
      trial
      shine;
      Here
      must
      his
      country,
      father,
      friends,
      be,
      in
      him,
      made
      divine.
      And
      such
      a
      stormy
      day
      shall
      come
      (in
      mind
      and
      soul
      I
      know)
      When
      sacred
      Troy
      shall
      shed
      her
      tow'rs
      for
      tears
      of
      overthrow,
      When
      Priam,
      all
      his
      birth
      and
      pow'r,
      shall
      in
      those
      tears
      be
      drown'd.
      But
      neither
      Troy's
      posterity
      so
      much
      my
      soul
      doth
      wound,
      Priam,
      nor
      Hecuba
      herself,
      nor
      all
      my
      brothers'
      woes,
      (Who
      though
      so
      many,
      and
      so
      good,
      must
      all
      be
      food
      for
      foes)
      As
      thy
      sad
      state,
      when
      some
      rude
      Greek
      shall
      lead
      thee
      weeping
      hence,
      These
      free
      days
      clouded,
      and
      a
      night
      of
      captive
      violence
      Loading
      thy
      temples,
      out
      of
      which
      thine
      eyes
      must
      never
      see,
      But
      spin
      the
      Greek
      wives'
      webs
      of
      task,
      and
      their
      fetch-water
      be
      To
      Argos,
      from
      Messeides,
      or
      clear
      Hyperia's
      spring;
      Which
      howsoever
      thou
      abhorr'st,
      
         
         Fate's
         such
         a
         shrewish
         thing
         She
         will
         be
         mistress;
      
      whose
      curs'd
      hands,
      when
      they
      shall
      crush
      out
      cries
      From
      thy
      oppressions
      (being
      beheld
      by
      other
      enemies)
   
   
      Thus
      they
      will
      nourish
      thy
      extremes:
      'This
      dame
      was
      Hector's
      wife,
      A
      man
      that,
      at
      the
      wars
      of
      Troy,
      did
      breathe
      the
      worthiest
      life
      Of
      all
      their
      army.'
      This
      again
      will
      rub
      thy
      fruitful
      wounds,
      To
      miss
      the
      man
      that
      to
      thy
      bands
      could
      give
      such
      narrow
      bounds.
      
         But
         that
         day
         shall
         not
         wound
         mine
         eyes;
         the
         solid
         heap
         of
         night
      
      Shall
      interpose,
      and
      stop
      mine
      ears
      against
      thy
      plaints,
      and
      plight."
      This
      said,
      he
      reach'd
      to
      take
      his
      son,
      who,
      of
      his
      arms
      afraid,
   
   
      bench
      of
      Gods:
   
   
      With
      these
      vain
      griefs.
      He
      doth
      not
      live
      that
      can
      disjoin
      my
      life
      And
      this
      firm
      bosom,
      but
      my
      fate;
      and
      fate,
      whose
      wings
      can
      fly?
      Noble,
      ignoble,
      fate
      controls.
      
         Once
         born,
         the
         best
         must
         die.

         their
         lower
         ebb.
      
   
   
      And
      as
      a
      fair
      steed
      proud
      With
      full-given
      mangers,
      long
      tied
      up,
      and
      now,
      his
      head-stall
      broke,
      He
      breaks
      from
      stable,
      runs
      the
      field,
      and
      with
      an
      ample
      stroke
      Measures
      the
      centre,
      neighs,
      and
      lifts
      aloft
      his
      wanton
      head,
      About
      his
      shoulders
      shakes
      his
      crest,
      and
      where
      he
      hath
      been
      fed,

      some
      calm
      flood
      wash'd,
      or,
      
         stung
         with
         his
         high
         plight,
      
      he
      flies
      Amongst
      his
      females,
      strength
      put
      forth,
      his
      beauty
      beautifies,
      And,
      
      life's
      mirror,
      bears
      his
      gait;
      so
      Paris
      from
      the
      tow'r
      Of
      lofty
      Pergamus
      came

      In
      carriage
      of
      his
      goodly
      parts,
      address'd
      now
      to
      the
      strife;

      will

      thy
      ability.
   
   
      On
      Jove's
      beech
      
      two

      think

      whose
      strength
      wild
      nourishment
      doth
      make
      so
      wondrous
      great.
   
   
      thee
      skill
      to
      use
      thy
      strength,
   
   
      Heaven
      yields

      best

      age,
   
   
      Then
      cherish'd
      he
      his
      famous
      horse:
      "O
      Xanthus,

      said
      he,

      solemn
      harp,

      was

      With
      works
      conceited
      through
      the

      embrac'd
      His

      was

      laid
      waste
   
   
      Aetion's
      city,
      he
      did
      choose

      loving
      sacred
      music
      well,
      made
      it

      Quite--
      requite,

      Speak,
      
         come
         not

      thou
      here?"
   
   
      And
      both
      took
      course
      to
      Diomed.
      They
      found
      him
      laid
      in

      Far
      from
      his
      tent;
      his

      by;
      about

      His
      spear
      fix'd
      by

      his
      royal

      had
      stay
      On
      arras
      hangings,
      rolled
      up;
      whereon
      he
      slept
      so
      fast,
   
   
      But,
      you
      must
      see,

      Ulysses,
      loth
      to
      be
      esteem'd
      a
      lover
      of
      his
      praise,
      With
      such
      exceptions
      humbled
      him
      as
      did
      him
      higher
      raise,
   
   
      With
      snowy
      tusks
      of
      white-mouth'd
      boars
      'twas
      armed
      round
      about
   
   
      Then
      spake
      he,
      threat'ning
      with
      his
      lance:
      "Or

      death
      outgone."
      This
      said,
      he
      threw
      his
      javelin
      forth;
      which
      miss'd
      as
      Diomed
      Would,
      Above
      his
      right
      arm
      making
      way,
      the
      pile
      stuck
      in
      the
      mould.
      He
      stay'd
      and
      trembled,
      and
      his
      teeth
      did
      chatter
      in
      his
      head.
      They
      came
      in
      blowing,
      seiz'd
      him
      fast;
      he,
      weeping,
      offered
   
   
      
         Tydides
         dreadfully
         replied:
      
      "Think

         sunder
         wound,
         And
         suddenly
         his
         head,
         deceiv'd,
         
            fell
            speaking
         
         on
         the
         ground.
         His
         weasel's
         helm
         they
         took,
         his
         bow,
         his
         wolf's
         skin,
         and
         his
         lance,
      
      Which
      to
      Minerva
      Ithacus
      did
      zealously
      advance,
      With
      lifted
      arm
      into
      the
      air;
      and
      to
      her
      thus
      he
      spake:
   
   
      
         An
         ill
         dream
      
      by
      Minerva
      sent
      that
      night
      stood
      by
      his
      head,
      Which
      was
      Oenides'
      royal
      son,
      unconquer'd
      Diomed.
   
   
      The
      red-ey'd
      Goddess,
      seated
      there,
      thunder'd
      th'
      Orthian
      song,
      High,
      and
      with
      horror,
      through
      the
      ears
      of
      all
      the
      Grecian
      throng.
      Her
      verse
      with
      spirits
      invincible
      did
      all
      their
      breasts
      inspire,
      Blew
      out
      all
      darkness
      from
      their
      limbs,
      and
      set
      their
      hearts
      on
      fire,
      And
      presently
      was
      bitter
      war
      more
      sweet
      a
      thousand
      times
      Than
      any
      choice
      in
      hollow
      keels
      to
      greet
      their
      native
      climes.
   
   
      But
      when
      in

      Vales
      the
      timber-feller
      takes
      A
      sharp
      set
      stomach
      to
      his
      meat,
      and
      dinner
      ready
      makes,
      so
      His
      sinews
      fainting,
      and
      his
      spirits
      become
      surcharg'd
      and
      dull,
      Time
      of
      accustom'd
      ease
      arriv'd,
      his
      hands
      with
      labour
      full,
      Then
      by
      their
      valours
      Greeks
      brake
      through
      the
      Trojan
      ranks,
      and
      cheer'd
   
   
      Where

      snatch'd
      in
      his
      solid
      jaws,
      and
      
         crusheth
         into
         mist
      
   
   
      his
      brother
      crouch'd

      flight,
      the
      batter'd
      centre
      flew
      In
      clouds
      of
      dust
      about
      their
      ears,
      rais'd
      from
      the
      horses'
      hooves,
      That
      beat
      a
      thunder
      out
      of
      earth
      as
      horrible
      as
      Jove's.
   
   
      Thick
      fell
      the
      Trojans,
      
         much
         more
         sweet
         to
         vultures
         than
         their
         wives.

      He
      fell
      and
      slept
      an
      iron
      sleep;
      wretched
      young
      man,
      he
      died,
      Far
      from
      his
      newly-married
      wife,
      in
      aid
      of
      foreign
      pride,
      And
      saw
      no
      pleasure
      of
      his
      love;
      yet
      was
      her
      jointure
      great,
      An
      hundred
      oxen
      gave
      he
      her,
      and
      vow'd
      in
      his
      retreat
   
   
      The
      king's
      brass
      javelin,
      as
      he
      drew,
      did
      strike
      him
      helpless
      dead;

      the
      worst
      it
      gives,
      With
      thought
      it
      must
      be,

      with

      Thrice
      shouted
      he
      aloud,
      As
      did
      denote
      a
      man
      engag'd.
   
   
      He
      told
      him
      of
      Ulysses'
      shouts,
      as
      if
      he

      near
      a

      cries,

      boys

      overborne
      By
      his
      insensible
      approach,

      simply
      he
      will
      eat,
      About
      whom
      many
      wands
      are
      broke,

      self-providing
      ass

      with
      their
      weakness

      father,
      our
      great
      friend

      apt
      to
      take
      offence,

      would
      not
      smother
      it
      in
      moods.
   
   
      And
      I
      had
      honour
      of
      my
      youth

      dies

      engor'd,
      In
      her
      strong
      seres,
      of
      wondrous
      size,
      and
      yet
      had
      no
      such
      check
      In
      life
      and
      spirit
      but
      still
      she
      fought,
      and
      turning
      back
      her
      neck
      So
      stung
      the
      eagle's
      gorge,
      that
      down
      she
      cast
      her
      fervent
      prey
      Amongst
      the
      multitude,
      and
      took
      upon
      the
      winds
      her
      way,
      Crying
      with
      anguish.
      When
      they
      saw
      a
      branded
      serpent

      full

      breasts
      of
      both;
      fill'd
      both
      their
      spirits,
      and
      made
      up
      every
      joint
      With
      pow'r
      responsive;
      when,
      hawk-,
      swift,
      and
      set
      sharp
      to
      fly,
      
         Hard,
         and
         gets
         ground
         still;
         Neptune
         so
         left
         these
         two,
         either's
         mind
      
   
   
      For
      he,
      in
      sight
      of
      all
      the
      host,
      Othryoneus
      slew,
      That
      from
      Cabesus,
      with
      the
      fame
      of
      those
      wars,
      thither
      drew
      His
      new-come
      forces,
      and
      requir'd,
      without
      respect
      of
      dow'r,
      Cassandra,
      fair'st
      of
      Priam's
      race;
      assuring
      with
      his
      pow'r,
      A
      mighty
      labour,
      to
      expel,
      in
      their
      despite,
      from
      Troy
      The
      sons
      of
      Greece.
      The
      king
      did
      vow,
      that
      done,
      he
      should
      enjoy
      His
      goodliest
      daughter.
      He,
      in
      trust
      of
      that
      fair
      purchase,
      fought;
      And
      at
      him
      threw
      the
      Cretan
      king
      a
      lance,
      that
      singled
      out
      
         This
         great
         assumer,
      
      whom
      it
      struck
      just
      in
      his
      navel-stead.
      His
      brazen
      curets
      helping
      nought
      resign'd
      him
      to
      the
      dead.
   
   
      "Now
      Asius
      lies
      not
      unreveng'd,
      nor
      doth
      his
      spirit
      want
      The
      joy
      I
      wish
      it,
      though
      it
      be
      now
      ent'ring
      the
      strong
      gate
      Of
      mighty
      Pluto,
      since
      this
      hand
      hath
      sent
      him
      down
      a
      mate."
   
   
      Of
      glory
      in
      Deiphobus,
      thus
      terribly
      exclaim'd:
      "Deiphobus,
      now
      may
      we
      think
      that
      we
      are
      evenly
      fam'd
      
         That
         three
         for
         one
         have
         sent
         to
         Dis.
      
      But
      come,
      change
      blows
      with
      me,
      Thy
      vaunts
      for
      him
      thou
      slew'st
      were
      vain.
      Come,
      wretch,
      that
      thou
      may'st
      see
      What
      issue
      Jove
      hath.
      Jove
      begot
      Minos,
      the
      strength
      of
      Crete;
      Minos
      begot
      Deucalion;
      Deucalion
      did
      beget
      Me
      Idomen,
      now
      Creta's
      king,
      that
      here
      my
      ships
      have
      brought
      To
      bring
      thyself,
      thy
      father,
      friends,
      all
      Ilion's
      pomp,
      to
      nought."
      Deiphobus
      at
      two
      ways
      stood,
      in
      doubt
      to
      call
      some
      one,
      With
      some
      retreat,
      to
      be
      his
      aid,
      or
      try
      the
      chance
      alone.
   
   
      
      sad
      and
      suspicious
      hearts
      Distemp'ring
      them,
   
   
      Whom
      Jove
      in
      his
      embraces
      holds."
      This
      spoken,
      she
      untied,
      And
      from
      her
      odorous
      bosom
      took,.her
      Ceston,
      in
      whose
      sphere
      Were
      all
      enticements
      to
      delight,
      all
      loves,
      all
      longings
      were,
      Kind
      conference,
      fair
      speech,
      whose
      pow'r
      the
      wisest
      doth
      inflame.
      This
      she
      resigning
      to
      her
      hands,
      thus
      urg'd
      her
      by
      her
      name:
   
   
      Death's
      brother,
      Sleep,
   
   
      Besides
      Jove,
      but
      I
      would
      becalm;
   
   
      Of
      travail
      with
      me,
      that
      must
      draw
      my
      coach
      through
      earth
      and
      seas.
      Whose
      far-intended
      reach,
      respect,
      and
      care
      not
      to
      displease
      Thy
      graces,
      made
      me
      not

      The

      God
      her
      guile
      in
      this
      sort
      did
      receive:
   
   
      And
      ran
      in
      at
      the

      a
      load
      of
      strength
      laid
      Ajax
      on
      As

      that
      head
      and
      face
      the

      possessions
      took,
      When
      all
      the
      low
      parts
      sprung
      in
      air,
      and
      thus
      did
      Ajax
      quit
      Panthuzdes'
      brave:
      "Now,

      By

      was
      the

      Greek.
      But
      him
      Jove
      look'd
      upon
      With
      eyes
      of
      pity;
      on
      his
      wife
      with
      horrible
      aspect,
      To
      whom
      he
      said:

      I

      formerly,
      so
      now,
      these

      thee
      up,
      how
      to
      thy
      feet
      I
      tied
      Two
      anvils,
      golden
      manacles
      on
      thy
      false
      wrists
      implied,

      let
      thee
      mercilessly

      seiz'd
      upon

      piece-meal
      dash'd
      the

      Nor

      my
      angry
      spirit
      calm'd
      so
      soon,
      for
      those
      foul

      On
      which,
      inducing
      northern
      flaws,
      thou
      shipwrack'dst
      Hercules,
      And
      toss'd
      him
      to
      the
      Coan
      shore,

      importance,

      freed
      my

      him
      safe
      ill

      nurse
      of
      horse.

      This
      heard,
      his
      charge
      she
      seem'd
      t'

      and
      to
      Olympus
      flew.

      now
      goes,
      still

      ways
      inclin'd;
      So
      reverend
      Juno
      headlong
      flew,
      and
      'gainst

      soon

      Immortals'
      fare,
      Though
      well
      you
      hear
      amongst

      Thus
      took
      she
      place,
      displeasedly;
      the
      feast
      in
      general
      Bewraying
      privy
      spleens
      at

      where
      death
      strikes
      I
      will

      Meantime
      I
      wish

      And
      as
      when
      arms
      enfold
      A
      city
      in
      an
      isle,
      from
      thence
      a
      fume
      at

      appears,
      Being

      men
      nigh,
      Seeing
      their
      distress,
      perhaps
      may
      set
      ships
      out
      to
      their

      So,

      such

      his
      head
      a

      rose,
      scaling
      heaven,
      And
      forth
      the
      wall
      he
      stept

      stood,
      nor

      the
      precept
      given

      his

      heard
   
   
      Twelve
      men
      of
      greatest
      strength
      in
      Troy
      left
      with
      their
      lives
      exhal'd
      I
      Their
      chariots
      and
      their
      darts,
      to
      death
      with
      his
      three
      summons
      call'd.
      And
      then
      the
      Grecians
      spritefully
      drew
      from
      the
      darts
      the
      corse,
   
   
      
         This
         counsel
         gat
         applause
         of
         all,
         so
         much
         were
         all
         unwise;
         Minerva
         robb'd
         them
         of
         their
         brains,
         to
         
         the
         ill
         advice
      
      The
      great
      man
      gave,
      and
      leave
      the
      good
      since
      by
      the
      meaner
      given.
   
   
      This
      said,
      he
      left
      her
      there,
      and
      forth
      did
      to
      his
      bellows
      go,
      Appos'd
      them
      to
      the
      fire
      again,
      commanding
      them
      to
      blow.
      Through
      twenty
      holes
      made
      to
      his
      hearth
      at
      once
      blew
      twenty
      pair,
      That
      fir'd
      his
      coals,
      sometimes
      with
      soft,
      sometimes
      with
      vehement,
      air,
      As
      he
      will'd,
      and
      his
      work
      requir'd.
      Amids
      the
      flame
      he
      cast
      Tin,
      silver,
      precious
      gold,
      and
      brass;
      and
      in
      the
      stock
      he
      plac'd
      A
      mighty
      anvil;
      his
      right
      hand
      a
      weighty
      hammer
      held,
      His
      left
      his
      tongs.
      And
      first
      he
      forg'd
      a
      strong
      and
      spacious
      shield
      Adorn'd
      with
      twenty
      several
      hues;
      about
      whose
      verge
      he
      beat
      A
      ring,
      three-fold
      and
      radiant,
      and
      on
      the
      back
      he
      set
      A
      silver
      handle;
      five-fold
      were
      the
      equal
      lines
      he
      drew
      About
      the
      whole
      circumference,
      in
      which
      his
      hand
      did
      shew
      (Directed
      with
      a
      knowing
      mind)
      a
      rare
      variety;
      For
      in
      it
      he
      presented
      Earth;
      in
      it
      the
      Sea
      and
      Sky;
      In
      it
      the
      never-wearied
      Sun,
      the
      Moon
      exactly
      round,
      And
      all
      those
      Stars
      with
      which
      the
      brows
      of
      ample
      heaven
      are
      crown'd

      the

      Hyades,

      surnam'd
      the
      That
      turns
      about
      heaven's
      axle-tree,
      holds
      ope
      a
      constant
      eye
      Upon
      Orion,
      and
      of
      all
      the
      cressets
      in
      the
      sky
      His
      golden
      forehead
      never

      Two
      cities
      in
      the
      spacious
      field
      he
      built,

      goodly
      state

      To
      these
      the
      fiery
      Artizan
      did
      add
      a
      new-ear'd
      field,
      Large
      and
      thrice
      plough'd,
      the
      soil
      being
      soft,
      and
      of
      a
      wealthy
      yield;
      And
      many
      men
      at
      plough
      he
      made,
      that
      drave
      earth
      here
      and
      there,
      And
      turn'd
      up
      stitches
      orderly,
      at
      whose
      end
      when
      they
      were,
      A
      fellow
      ever
      gave
      their
      hands
      full
      cups
      of
      luscious
      wine;
      Which
      emptied,
      for
      another
      stitch,
      the
      earth
      they
      undermine,
      And
      long
      till
      th'
      utmost
      bound
      be
      reach'd
      of
      all
      the
      ample
      close.
      The
      soil
      turn'd
      up
      behind
      the
      plough
      all
      black
      
      earth
      arose,
      Though
      forg'd
      of
      nothing
      else
      but
      gold,
      and
      lay
      in

      as
      light
      As
      if
      it
      had
      been
      plough'd
      indeed,
      miraculous
      to
      sight.
   
   
      Of
      our
      debate,
      that
      Fury
      stole
      in
      that
      act
      on
      my
      pow'r.
      And
      more;
      all
      things
      are
      done
      by
      strife;
      that
      ancient
      seed
      of
      Jove,
      Ate,
      that
      hurts
      all,
      perfects
      all,
      her
      feet
      are
      soft,
      and
      move
      Not
      on
      the
      earth,
      they
      hear
      her
      still
      aloft
      men's
      heads,
      and
      there
   
   
      The
      conflict
      wearing
      out
      our
      men
      was
      late,
      and
      held
      as
      long,
      Wherein,
      though
      most
      Jove
      stood
      for
      Troy,
      he
      yet
      made
      our
      part
      strong
      To
      bear
      that
      most.
      But
      'twas
      to
      bear,
      and
      that
      breeds
      little
      heart.
      Let
      wine
      and
      bread
      then
      add
      to
      it;
      they
      help
      the
      twofold
      part,
      The
      soul
      and
      body,
      in
      a
      man,
      both
      force
      and
      fortitude.
      All
      day
      men
      cannot
      fight
      and
      fast,
      though
      never
      so
      indued
      With
      minds
      to
      fight,
      for,
      that
      suppos'd,
      there
      lurks
      yet
      secretly
      Thirst,
      hunger,
      in
      th'
      oppressed
      joints
      which
      no
      mind
      can
      supply.
      They
      take
      away
      a
      marcher's
      knees.
      Men's
      bodies
      throughly
      fed,
      Their
      minds
      share
      with
      them
      in
      their
      strength;
      and,
      all
      day
      combated,
      One
      stirs
      not,
      till
      you
      call
      off
      all.
      Dismiss
      them
      then
      to
      meat,
      And
      let
      Atrides
      tender
      here,
      in
      sight
      of
      all
      this
      seat,
   
   
      Nor
      will
      it
      aught
      impair
      a

      "I
      joy,"
      replied
      the
      king,
   
   
      That
      one
      day's
      moan
      should
      serve
      one
      man.
      The
      dead
      must
      end
      with
      death,
   
   
      And
      thy
      unwearied
      steel
      as
      right,
      nor
      utterly
      be
      beat
      With
      
         only
         cruelty
         of
         words,
      
      not
      proof
      against
      a
      threat."
   
   
      And
      manifest
      their
      proper
      forms,
      are
      passing
      dreadful
      then."
   
   
      Fell
      anger
      lathers
      in
      his
      jaws,
   
   
      But
      Jove
      gives
      virtue;
      he
      augments,
      and
      he
      impairs
      the
      worth
      Of
      all
      men;
      and
      his
      will
      their
      rule;
      he,
      strong'st,
      all
      strength
      affords.
   
   
      Is
      better
      and
      more
      dear
      than
      thee
      ?
      Hereafter,
      lest,
      past
      fates,
      Hell
      be
      thy
      headlong
      home,
      retire,

      bold
      stand
      never
      near.
      Where
      he
      advanceth.
      But
      his
      fate
      once
      satisfied,
      then
      bear
      A
      free
      and
      full
      sail;
      no
      Greek
      else
      shall
      end
      thee."
      This
      reveal'd,
      He
      left
      him,
      and
      dispers'd
      the
      cloud
      that
      all
      this
      act
      conceal'd
   
   
      Near
      fishy
      Hyllus
      and
      the
      gulfs
      of
      Hermus,
      but
      this
      day
   
   
      Out
      at
      his
      navel.
      On
      his
      knees
      the
      poor
      prince
      crying
      fell,
      And
      gather'd
      with
      his
      tender
      hands
      his
      entrails
      that
      did
      swell
      Quite
      through
      the
      wide
      wound,
      till
      a
      cloud
      as
      black
      as
      death
      conceal'd
      Their
      sight,
      and
      all
      the
      world
      from
      him.
      When
      Hector
      had
      beheld
      His
      brother
      tumbled
      so
      to
      earth,
      his
      entrails
      still
      in
      hand,
      Dark
      sorrow
      overcast
      his
      eyes,
      nor
      far
      off
      could
      he
      stand
   
   
      and
      'tis
      this."
   
   
      In
      his
      hot
      fury,
      he
      was
      none
      of
      these
      remorseful
      men,
      Gentle
      and
      affable,
      but
      fierce
      at
      all
      times,
      and
      mad
      then.

      Come
      then,
      he
      now
      shall
      taste
      The
      head
      of
      Pelias,
      and
      try
      if
      steel
      will
      down
      as
      fast
      As
      other

      any
      surer
      seize
      On
      his
      sly
      person,
      whose
      strong
      arms
      have
      held
      down
      Hercules."
      His
      thoughts
      thus
      mov'd
      while
      he
      stood
      firm;
      to
      see
      if
      he,
      he
      spied,
   
   
      An
      arrow
      that
      must
      reach
      my
      life."
      This
      said,
      
         a
         languishing
      
      Lycaon's
      heart
      bent
      
      his
      knees,
      yet
      left
      him
      strength
      t'
      advance
      Both
      hands
      for
      mercy
      as
      he
      kneel'd.

      in

      Quickly

      answer'd:

      how,
      alas!

      She
      said:
      "Thy

      use
      these
      rites
      of
      piety;
      For
      I
      suppose
      his
      youth
      doth
      prayers
      use,
      Since
      all
      men
      need
      the
      Gods.
      But
      you
      I
      choose
      First
      in
      this
      cup's

      his

      And
      since
      a
      wise
      and
      just
      man

      her
      free
      receit,
      
         Even
         to
         the
         Goddess
         it
         did
         add
         delight,
      
   
   
      And
      therefore
      many
      felt
      so
      sharp
      a
      fate,
      Sent
      from
      Minerva's
      most
      pernicious
      hate;
      Whose
      mighty
      Father
      can
      do
      fearful
      things".
   
   
      She
      would
      not
      so
      be
      won;
      for
      not
      with
      ease
      Th'
      Eternal
      Gods
      are
      turn'd
      from
      what
      they
      please.
   
   
      We
      turn'd
      to
      studying
      either
      other's
      woe;
      When
      Jove
      besides
      made
      ready
      woes
      enow.
   
   
      But
      I
      fled
      all,
      with
      all
      that
      follow'd
      me,
      Because
      I
      knew
      God
      studied
      misery,
   
   
      He
      answer'd:
      "O
      thou
      greatest
      grace
      of
      Greece,
      Orestes
      made
      that
      wreak
      his
      master-piece,
      And
      him
      the
      Greeks
      will
      give
      a
      master-praise,
      Verse
      finding
      him

      And
      would
      to
      God
      the
      Gods
      would
      favour
      me

      that
      my
      injury,
      Done
      by
      my
      mother's
      Wooers,
      being
      so
      foul,
      I
      might
      revenge
      upon
      their
      every
      soul;
      Who,
      pressing
      me
      with
      contumelies,
      dare
      Such
      things
      as
      past
      the
      power
      of
      utt'rance
      are.
      But
      Heaven's
      great
      Powers
      have
      graced
      my
      destiny
      With
      no
      such
      honour.
      Both
      my
      sire
      and
      I
      Are
      born
      to
      suffer
      everlastingly."
   
   
      So
      blest
      an
      honour.
      Not
      by
      any
      means,
      If
      Hope
      should
      prompt
      me,
      or
   
   
      
         
         blind
         Confidence,
      
      (The
      God

      Fools)
   
   
      Might
      see
      no
      worse
      of
      her,
      when
      both
      were
      blown
      To
      sacred
      Sunium,
      of
      Minerva's
      town
      The
      goodly
      promontory,

      his
      shafts
      severe

      slew
      him

      said,

      the

      But
      Helen
      now
      on
      new
      device
      did
      stand,
      Infusing
      straight
      a
      medicine
      to
      their
      wine,
      That,
      drowning
      cares
      and
      angers,
      did
      decline
      All
      thought
      of
      ill.
      Who
      drunk
      her
      cup
      could
      shed
      All
      that

      not
      a

      no
      not

      That
      day
      his
      father
      or
      his

      Were,
      Not
      if
      his
      brother,
      child,
      or
      chiefest
      dear,
      He
      should
      see
      murder'd
      then
      before
      his
      face.
      Such
      useful
      medicines,
      only
      borne
      in
      grace
      Of
      what
      was
      good,

      Helen
      ever
      have.

      bent;

      To
      ask
      so
      far.
      It
      fits
      thee
      not
      to
      be
      So
      cunning
      in
      thine
      own
      calamity.
      Nor
      seek
      to
      learn
      what
      learn'd
      thou
      shouldst
      forget.
      Men's
      knowledges
      have
      proper
      limits

      not

      But
      'twill

      A
      common
      word.
   
   
      Swum
      on
      the
      rough
      waves
      of
      the
      world's
      vast
      mote,

      having
      drunk
      a
      salt
      cup
      for
      his
      sin,
   
   
      In
      which
      again
      a
      generous
      spring
      began
      Of
      fitting
      comfort,
      as
      I
      was
      a
      man;
      But,
      as
      a
      brother,
      I
      must
      ever
      mourn.
   
   
      I
      had
      the
      passport
      now
      of
      every
      God,
   
   
      'Tis
      yet
      with
      other
      kings
      another
      right,
      One
      to
      pursue
      with
      love,
      another
      spite;
      He
      still
      yet
      just,
      nor
      would,
      though
      might,
      devour,
      Nor
      to
      the
      worst
      did
      ever
      taste
      of
      power.
      But
      their
      unrul'd
      acts
      show
      their
      minds'
      estate.
   
   
      And
      put
      in
      ships
      the
      trust
      of
      his
      distress,
      That
      are

      unbridled
      horse,
   
   
      Nor
      in
      her
      choice
      of
      state
      chairs
      stood
      inclined
      To
      take
      her
      seat,
      but
      th'
      abject
      threshold
      chose
      Of
      her
      fair
      chamber
      for
      her
      loath'd
      repose,
      And
      mourn'd
      most
      wretch-.
      Round
      about
      her
      fell
   
   
      The
      seed
      of
      righteous
      Arcesiades,
      To
      end
      it
      utterly,
      but
      still

      please
      In

      place
      evermore
      some
      one
      of
      them

      and
      deck
      him
      with
      a
      diadem,
      Give
      him
      possession
      of
      erected
      tow'rs,
      And
      far-stretch'd
      fields,
      crown'd
      all
      of
      fruits
      and
      flow'rs."
   
   
      Whose
      pride
      his
      youth
      had
      made
      the
      more
      extreme,
      Said:
      "Now
      the
      many-wooer-honour'd
      queen
      Will
      surely
      satiate
      her
      delayful
      spleen,
      And
      one
      of
      us
      in
      instant
      nuptials
      take.
      Poor
      dame,
      she
      dreams
      not,
      what
      design
      we
      make
      Upon
      the
      life
      and
      slaughter
      of
      her
      son."
      So
      said
      he;
      but
      so
      said
      was

      said,

      Thus
      dreadful
      is
      the
      presence

      our

      The

      he
      cling'd

      That

      he
      fell,

      no

      Spent
      to

      down

         The
         sea
         had
         soak'd

      And
      as

      on;
      So
      this

      A

      did
      press

      of

      Horrid
      was
      His

      to
      them;

      sweet,

      when
      his

      the

      But
      when
      again
      began,
      By
      all
      the
      kings'
      desires,
      the
      moving
      man,
      Again
      Ulysses
      could
      not
      choose
      but
      yield
      To
      that
      soft
      passion,
      which
      again,
      withheld,
      He
      kept
      so
      cunningly
      from
      sight,
      that
      none,

      I
      see,
      the
      Gods
      to
      all
      men
      give
      not
      all
      Manly
      addiction,
      wisdom,
      words
      that
      fall,
      
      dice,
      upon
      the
      square
      still.
      Some
      man
      takes
      form
      from
      parents,
      but
      God
      often
      makes
      That
      fault
      of
      form
      up
      with
      observ'd
      repair
      Of
      pleasing
      speech,
      that
      makes
      him
      held
      for
      fair,
      That
      makes
      him
      speak
      securely,
      makes
      him
      shine
      In
      an
      assembly
      with
      a
      grace
      divine.
      Men
      take
      delight
      to
      see
      how
      evenly
      lie
      His
      words
      asteep
      in
      honey
      modesty.
      Another,
      then,
      hath
      fashion
      
      a
      God,
      But
      in
      his
      language
      he
      is
      foul
      and
      broad.
      And
      such
      art
      thou.
      A
      person
      fair
      is
      given,
      But
      nothing
      else
      is
      in
      thee
      sent
      from
      heaven;
      For
      in
      thee
      lurks
      a
      base
      and
      earthy
      soul,
      And
      t'
      hast
      compell'd
      me,
      with
      a
      speech
      most
      foul,
      To
      be
      thus
      bitter,
      I
      am
      not
      unseen
      In
      these
      fair
      strifes,
      as
      thy
      words
   
   
      But
      urge
      the
      whole
      state
      of
      you;
      only
      one,
      I
      will
      not
      challenge
      in
      my
      forced
      boast,
      And
      that's
      Laodamas,
      for
      he's
      mine
      host.
      And
      who
      will
      fight,
      or
      wrangle,
      with
      his
      friend?
   
   
      Unwise
      he
      is,
      and
      base,
      that
      will
      contend
      With
      him
      that
      feeds
      him,
      in
      a
      foreign
      place;
      And
      takes
      all
      edge
      off
      from
      his
      own
      sought
      grace.
   
   
      
         And
         shook
         a
         most
         divine
         dance
         from
         their
         feet,
      
      That
      twinkled
      star-,
      mov'd
      as
      swift,
      and
      fine,
      And
      beat
      the
      air
      so
      thin,
      they
      made
      it
      shine.
      Ulysses
      wonder'd
      at
      it,
      but
      amaz'd
      He
      stood
      in
      mind
      to
      hear
      the
      dance
      so
      phras'd.
      For,
      as
      they
      danc'd,
      Demodocus
      did
      sing,
   
   
      The
      dancers'
      feet
      kept
      as
      his
      hands
      his
      cords.
      Ulysses
      much
      was
      pleased,
      and
      all
      the
      crew.
   
   
      
      make
      him
      hold
   
   My
   memory
   always
   dear,
   
      This
      when
      Ulysses
      heard,
      all
      sure
      her
      made,
      Enclosed
      and
      bound

      then

      North
      Cloud-gathering
      Jove
      a

      took
      in,
      instantly
      Fell
      to

      Where,
      the
      first
      they
      met,
      Were
      the
      Lotophagi,
      that
      made
      them
      eat
      Their
      country
      diet,
      and
      no
      ill
      intent
      Hid
      in
      their
      hearts
      to
      them;
      and
      yet
      th'
      event
      To
      ill
      converted
      it,
      for,
      having
      eat
      Their
      dainty
      viands,
      they
      did
      quite
      forget
      (As
      all
      men
      else
      that
      did
      but
      taste
      their
      feast)
      Both
      countrymen
      and
      country,
      nor
      address'd
      Any
      return
      t'
      inform
      what
      sort
      of
      men
      Made
      fix'd
      abode
      there,
      but
      would
      needs
      maintain
      Abode
      themselves
      there,
      and
      eat
      that
      food
      ever.
      I
      made
      out
      after,
      and
      was
      feign
      to
      sever
      Th'
      enchanted
      knot
      by
      forcing
      their
      retreat,
      That
      strived,
      and
      wept,
      and
      would
      not
      leave
      their
      meat
      For
      heaven
      itself.
      But,
      dragging
      them
      to
      fleet,
      I
      wrapt
      in
      sure
      bands
      both
      their
      hands
      and
      feet,
      And
      cast
      them
      under
      hatches,
      and
      away
      Commanded
      all
      the
      rest
      without
      least
      stay,
   
   
      Lest
      they
      should
      taste
      the
      lote
      too,
      and
      forget
      With
      such
      strange
      raptures
      their
      despised
      retreat.
   
   
      Of
      massy
      silver;
      but
      his
      gift
      most
      famed
      Was
      twelve
      great
      vessels,
      fill'd
      with
      such
      rich
      wine
      As
      was
      incorruptible
      and
      divine.
      He
      kept
      it
      as
      his
      jewel,
      which
      none
      knew
      But
      he
      himself,
      his
      wife,
      and
      he
      that
      drew.
      It
      was
      so
      strong,
      that
      never
      any
      fill'd
      A
      cup,
      where
      that
      was
      but
      by
      drops
      instill'd,
      And
      drunk
      it
      off,
      but
      'twas
      before
      allay'd
      With
      twenty
      parts
      in
      water;
      yet
      so
      sway'd
      The
      spirit
      of
      that
      little,
      that
      the
      whole
      A
      sacred
      odour
      breath'd
      about
      the
      bowl.
      Had
      you
      the
      odour
      smelt
      and
      scent
      it
      cast,
      It
      would
      have
      vex'd
      you
      to
      forbear
      the
      taste.
      But
      then,
      the
      taste
      gain'd
      too,
      the
      spirit
      it
      wrought
      To
      dare
      things
      high
      set
      up
      an
      end
      my
      thought.
      Of
      this
      a
      huge
      great
      flagon
      full
      I
      bore,
   
   
      That
      in
      thy
      recompense
      I
      may
      bestow
      A
      hospitable
      gift
      on
      thy
      desert,
      And
      such
      a
      one
      as
      shall
      rejoice
      thy
      heart.
      For
      to
      the
      Cyclops
      too
      the
      gentle
      earth
      Bears
      generous
      wine,
      and
      Jove
      augments
      her
      birth,
      In
      store
      of
      such,
      with
      but
      this
      rich
      wine
      Fell
      from
      the
      river,
      that
      is
      mere
      divine,
      Of
      nectar
      and
      ambrosia.'
      This
      again
      I
      gave
      him,
      and
      again;
      nor
      could
      the
      fool
      abstain,
      But
      drunk
      as
      often.
      When
      the
      noble
      juice
      Had
      wrought
      upon
      his
      spirit,
      I
      then
      gave
      use
   
   
      And
      eat
      his
      fellows.
      Thou
      mightst
      know
      there
      were
      Some
      ills
      behind,
      rude
      swain,
      for
      thee
      to
      bear,
      That
      fear'd
      not
      to
      devour
      thy
      guests,
      and
      break
      All
      laws
      of
      humans.
      Jove
      sends
      therefore
      wreak,
      And
      all
      the
      Gods,
      by
      me.'
      This
      blew
      the
      more
      His
      burning
      fury;
      when
      the
      top
      he
      tore
   
   
      When
      now
      a
      weakling
      came,
      a
      dwarfy
      thing,
      A
      thing
      of
      nothing;
      
         who
         yet
         wit
         did
         bring,
      
      That
      brought
      supply
      to
      all,
      and
      with
      his
      wine
   
   
      Then
      flew
      fierce
      vows
      to
      Neptune,
      both
      his
      hands
      To
      star-born
      heaven
      cast:
      'O
      thou
      that
      all
      lands
      Gird'st
      in
      thy
      ambient
      circle,
      and
      in
      air
      Shak'st
      the
      curl'd
      tresses
      of
      thy
      sapphire
      hair,
      If
      I
      be
      thine,
      or
      thou
      mayst
      justly
      vaunt
      Thou
      art
      my
      father,
      hear
      me
      now,
      and
      grant
      That
      this
      Ulysses,
      old
      Laertes'
      son,
      That
      dwells
      in
      Ithaca,
      and
      name
      hath
      won
      Of
      city-ruiner,
      may
      never
      reach
      His
      natural
      region.
      Or
      if
      to
      fetch
   
   
      As
      gift
      from
      AEolus,
      and
      said:
      'O
      heaven!
      What
      grace
      and
      grave
      price
      is
      by
      all
      men
      given
      To
      our
      commander!
      Whatsoever
      coast
      Or
      town
      he
      comes
      to,
      how
      much
      he
      engrost
      Of
      fair
      and
      precious
      prey,
      and
      brought
      from
      Troy!
      We
      the
      same
      voyage
      went,
      and
      yet
      enjoy
      In
      our
      return
      these
      empty
      hands
      for
      all.
      This
      bag,
      now,
      AEolus
      was
      so
      liberal
   
   
      Your
      powers
      command
      it.'
      Thus
      endeavour'd
      I
      With
      soft
      speech
      to
      repair
      my
      misery.
      The
      rest
      with
      ruth
      sat
      dumb.
      But
      thus
      spake
      he:
      'Avaunt,
      and
      quickly
      quit
      my
      land
      of
      thee,
      Thou
      worst
      of
      all
      that
      breathe.
      It
      fits
      not
      me
      To
      convoy,
      and
      take
      in,
      whom
      Heavens
      expose.
      Away,
      and
      with
      thee
      go
      the
      worst
      of
      woes,
      That
      seek'st
      my
      friendship,
      and
      the
      Gods
      thy
      foes.'
      Thus
      he
      dismiss'd
      me
      sighing.
      Forth
      we
      sail'd,
   
   
      And
      yet
      would
      I
      no
      entry
      make,
      but
      stay'd
      Alone
      without
      the
      haven,
      and
      thence
      survey'd
      From
      out
      a
      lofty
      watch-tower
      raised
      there,
   
   
      And
      soothe
      their
      entries
      with
      their
      fawns
      and
      bounds,
      All
      guests
      still
      bringing
      some
      scraps
      for
      their
      hounds;
      So,
      on
      these
      men,
      the
      wolves
      and
      lions
      ramp'd,
      Their
      horrid
      paws
      set
      up.
      Their
      spirits
      were
      damp'd
      To
      see
      such
      
         monstrous
         kindness,
      
      stay'd
      at
      gate,
      And
      heard
      within
      it;

      'O

      I
      replied,
      'what

      urgent
      labours.
      Yet
      his
      smart
      I
      wept
      to
      see,
      and
      rued
      it
      from
      my
      heart,
      Enquiring
      how
      he
      could

      came

      He,
      mourning,
      answer'd
      me:
   
   
      With
      which
      alive

      (Though
      in

      ruth
      she
      held
      the

      I
      admit

      I
      excerpted.

      My

      To

      then
      each

      in
      a
      strait
      Of
      so
      much
      danger,
      much
      the
      better
      might
      Be
      hit
      by
      me,
      than
      others,
      as,
      provoked,
      I
      shifted
      place
      still,
      when,
      in
      some
      I
      smoked
      Both
      privy
      tremblings,
      and
      close
      vent
      of
      tears,
   
   
      This
      made
      the
      soul
      of
      swift
      Achilles
      tread
      A
      march
      of
      glory
      through
      the
      herby

      so
      renown
      his
      son;
      And
      vanish'd
      stalking.
      But
      with
      passion
   
   
      All
      this
      no
      word
      drew
      from
      him,
      but
      less
      near
      The
      stern
      soul
      kept;
      to
      other
      souls
      he
      fled,
      And
      glid
      along
      the
      river
      of
      the
      dead.
   
   
      Into
      his
      liver
      with
      their
      crooked
      beaks;

      set
      on
      either
      side.
      Nor
      doth
      he
      ever
      labour
      to
      divide
      His
      liver
      and
      their
      beaks,
      nor
      with
      his
      hand
      Offer
      them
      off,
      but
      suffers
      by
      command
   
   
      The
      sweat
      came
      gushing
      out
      from
      every
      pore,
      And
      on
      his
      head
      a
      standing
      mist
      he
      wore,
      Reeking
      from
      thence,
      as
      if
      a
      cloud
      of
      dust
      Were
      raised
      about
      it.
      Down
      with
      these
      was
      thrust
   
   
      About
      him
      flew
      the
      clamours
      of
      the
      dead
      
      fowls,
      and
      still
      stoop'd
      cufling
      at
      his
      head.
      He
      with
      his
      bow,
      
      Night,
      stalk'd
      up
      and
      down,
      His
      shaft
      still
      nock'd
      and
      hurling
      round
      his
      frown
      At
      those
      vex'd
      hoverers,
      aiming
      at
      them
      still,
      And
      still,
      as
      shooting
      out,
      desire
      to
      still.

      I
      was

      on
      my

      Of

      which
      one
      was,
      to
      descend
      this
      strand,
      And
      hale
      the

      from
      thence.
      He

      not

      but
      before

      In

      venting
      sounds
      so
      rude,
      That
      pale
      Fear
      took
      me,

      I
      therefore
      sent
      My
      men
      before

      at

      took,
      Up
      to

      went,
      and
      thence
      did

      rocky
      Scylla
      would
      have
      first
      appear'd,
      And
      taken
      my
      life
      with
      the

      fear'd.

      we
      saw

      so
      much

      all

         Yet
         so
         wise
         a
         hand
         He
         carried,
         even
         of
         this
         joy,
         flown
         so
         high,
         That
         other
         end
         he
         put
         to

         reply
      
      Than
      straight

      and
      lay
      abroad
      His

      Therefore
      he
      bestow'd
   
   
      A
      veil
      on
      truth;
      for
      evermore
      did
      wind

      thus
      his

      show'd:

      But
      where
      you
      wonder

      not

      thy

      therefore,
      truly
      to

      thee

      Thee

      their

      but,
      since
      thy
      seeming
      view
      Appears

      But
      this
      I
      surely
      know,
      that,
      some
      years
      past,
      I
      have

      Friendliest
      to
      sleep
      and
      silence,
      he
      resolv'd
      With
      all
      his
      legions
      to
      dislodge,
      and

      Unworship'd,

      Awak'ning,
      thus
      to
      him
      in
      secret
      spake.
      Sleep'st
      thou,
      companion
      dear,
      what
      sleep
      can
      close
      Thy
      eyelids?
      and
      remember'st
      what
      decree
      Of
      yesterday
      so
      late
      hath
      past
      the
      lips
   
   
      Now
      ere
      dim
      night
      had
      disincumber'd
      heaven,
      
         great
         hierarchal
         standard
      
      was
      to
      move;
   
   
      Tells
      the
      suggested
      cause,
      and
      casts
      between
      Ambiguous
      words
      and
      jealousies,
      to
      sound
      Or
      taint
      integrity:
      but
      all
      obey'd
      The
      wonted
      signal,
      and
      superior
      voice
   
   
      Equally
      free;
      for
      orders
      and
      degrees
      Jar
      not
      with
      liberty,
      but
      well
      consist.
   
   
      So
      spake
      the
      fervent
      angel;
      but
      his
      zeal
      None
      seconded,
      as
      out
      of
      season
      judg'd,
      Or
      singular
      and
      rash;
      whereat
      rejoic'd
   
   
      He
      said,
      and,
      as
      the
      sound
      of
      waters
      deep,
      Hoarse
      murmur
      echo'd
      to
      his
      words
      applause
      Through
      the
      infinite
      host;
      nor
      less
      for
      that
      The
      flaming
      seraph
      fearless,
      though
      alone
      Encompass'd
      round
      with
      foes,
      thus
      answer'd
      bold.
   
   
      So
      spake
      the
      seraph
      Abdiel
      faithful
      found,
   
   
      Among
      the
      faithless
      faithful
      only
      he:
      Among
      innumerable
      false
      unmov'd,
      Unshaken,
      unseduc'd,
      unterrify'd,
      His
      loyalty
      he
      kept,
      his
      love,
      his
      zeal;
      Nor
      number,
      nor
      example
      with
      him
      wrought
      To
      swerve
      from
      truth,
      or
      change
      his
      constant
      mind
      Though
      single.
      From
      amidst
      them
      forth
      he
      pass'd,
      Long
      way
      through
      hostile
      scorn,
      which
      he
      sustain'd
      Superior,
      nor
      of
      violence
      fear'd
      aught;
      And
      with
      retorted
      scorn
      his
      back
      he
      turn'd
   
   
      On
      those
      proud
      tow'rs
      to
      swift
      destruction
      doom'd.
   
   
      With
      joy
      and
      acclamations
      loud,
      that
      one,
      That
      of
      so
      many
      myriads
      fall'n
      yet
      one
      Return'd
      not
      lost.
      On
      to
      the
      sacred
      hill
   
   
      high
      applauded
   
   
      And
      for
      the
      testimony
      of
      truth
      hast
      borne
      Universal
      reproach,
      far
      worse
      to
      bear
      Than
      violence:
      for
      this
      was
      all
      thy
      care,
   
   
      To
      stand
      approv'd
      in
      sight
      of
      God,
      though
      worlds
      Judg'd
      thee
      perverse.
      The
      easier
      conquest
      now
   
   
      
         With

      Aspirer
   
   
      Twixt

      was
      left,
      
         
            
               A
               dreadful

         Of

         length:
         before
         the
         cloudy
         van,
         On
         the

         edge
         of
         battle

      When

      To

      erroneous

      How
      few

      Vigour

      within

      can
      allow
      Omnipotence

      But
      well
      thou
      com'st
   
   
      the
      minstrelsy
      of
      heaven,
   
   
      Unjustly
      thou
      deprav'st
      it
      with
      the
      name
      Of
      servitude
      to
      serve
      whom
      God
      ordains,
      Or
      Nature;
      God
      and
      Nature
      bid
      the
      same,
   
   
      When
      he
      who
      rules
      is
      worthiest,
      and
      excels
      Them
      whom
      he
      governs.
      This
      is
      servitude,
      To
      serve
      th'
      unwise,
      or
      him
      who
      hath
      rebell'd
      Against
      his
      worthier,
      as
      thine
      now
      serve
      thee,
   
   
      Thy
      self
      not
      free,
      but
      to
      thy
      self
      enthrall'd;
      Yet
      leudly
      dar'st
      our
      minist'ring
      upbraid.
      Reign
      thou
      in
      hell
      thy
      kingdom,
      let
      me
      serve
      In
      heav'n
      God
      ever
      bless'd,
      and
      his
      divine
      Behests
      obey,
      worthiest
      to
      be
      obey'd;
      Yet
      chains
      in
      hell,
      not
      realms
      expect:
      mean
      while
      
         From
         me
         return'd,
         as
         erst
         thou
         saidst,
         from
         flight,
         This
         greeting
         on
         thy
         impious
         crest
         receive.
      
      So
      saying,
      a
      noble
      stroke
      he
      lifted
      high,
   
   
      He
      back
      recoil'd;
      the
      tenth
      on
      bended
      knee
      His
      massy
      spear
      upstay'd;
      as
      if
      on
      earth
      Winds
      under
      ground
      or
      waters,
      forcing
      way
      Side-long,
      had
      push'd
      a
      mountain
      from
      his
      seat,
      Half
      sunk
      with
      all
      his
      pines.
      Amazement
      seiz'd
      The
      rebel
      thrones,
      but
      greater
      rage
      to

      The

      Nor

      Of

      threats
      to

      whom

      imperious,
      and
      with
      threats
      To
      chase
      me
      hence?
      err
      not
      that
      so
      shall
      end
      The
      strife
      which
      thou
      call'st
      evil,
      but
      we
      style
      The
      strife
      of
      glory:
      which
      we
      mean
      to
      win,
      Or
      turn
      this
      heaven
      itself
      into
      the

      Thou

      however
      to
      dwell
      free,
      If
      not
      to

      meanwhile
      thy

         Of

      And
      with
      fierce
      ensigns
      pierc'd
      the
      deep
      array
      Of
      Moloc
      furious
      king,
      who
      him

      Refrain'd
      his

      anon,
      Down
      cloven
      to
      the

      with
      shatter'd
      arms
      And
      uncouth
      pain
      fled
      bellowing.
      On

      Raphael
      his

      less

      Disdain'd,

      The

      Of

         Illaudable,
         naught

            through

            Therefore

         out
         of

      he
      put
      not

      His

      But

      And,
      manifold
      in

      The

      on
      him
      brought
      by

      The

      of

         undissembled
         hate,)
         with
         what

         She
         sought

      to
      let
      in
      the
      foe,
      Effeminately

      enchanted
      cup
      and
      warbling
      charms
      No

      power;
      their

      Private
      reward,
   
   
      Made
      older
      than
      thy

      through
      eyesight
      lost.
   
   
      Not

      idle
      with
      so
      great
      a
      gift
      Useless,
      and
      thence
      ridiculous,
      about
      him.
      And
      since
      his
      strength
      with

      was
      not

      Despis'd

      So
      virtue
      given
      for
      lost,
      Depress'd,
      and

      bird
      In

      That
      no

      lay
      ere

      From
      out
      her

      now

      I

      Dingle

      My

      May

      and
      enjoy
      bright
      day:
      But
      he
      that
      hides
      a
      dark
      soul,
      and
      foul
      thoughts,
      Benighted
      walks
      under
      the
      mid-day
      sun;
      Himself
      is
      his
      own
      dungeon.
   
   
      She
      that
      has
      that,

      purity:
      Yea
      there,
      where
      very
      desolation
      dwells,
      By
      grots,
      and
      caverns
      shagg'd
      with
      horrid
      shades,
      She
      may
      pass
      on
      with

      majesty,
      Be
      it
      not
      done
      in

      or
      in
      presumption.
      Some
      say
      no
      evil
      thing
      that
      walks
      by
      night,
      In

      fire,
      by
      lake,
      or
      moorish
      fen,
      Blue
      meager
      hag,
      or
      stubborn
      unlaid
      ghost,
      That
      breaks
      his
      magic
      chains
      at
      curfew
      time,
      No
      goblin,
      or
      swart
      faery
      of

      mine,
      Hath
      hurtful
      power
      o'er
      true
      virginity.
      Do
      ye
      believe
      me
      yet,
      or
      shall
      I
      call
      Antiquity
      from
      the
      old
      schools
      of
      Greece
      To
      testify
      the
      arms
      of
      chastity?
   
   
      What
      was
      that
      snaky-headed
      Gorgon
      shield,
      That
      wise
      Minerva
      wore,
      unconquer'd
      virgin,
      Wherewith
      she
      freez'd
      her
      foes
      to
      congeal'd
      stone,
   
   
      But
      rigid
      looks
      of
      chaste
      austerity,
   
   
      So
      dear
      to
      heav'n
      is
      saintly
      chastity,
      That
      when
      a
      soul
      is
      found
      sincerely
      so,
      A
      thousand
      liveried
      angels
      lacky
      her,
      Driving
      far
      off
      each
      thing
      of
      sin
      and
      guilt,
      And
      in
      clear
      dream,
      and
      solemn
      vision,
      Tell
      her
      of
      things
      that
      no
      gross
      ear
      can
      hear,
      
         Till
         oft
         converse
         with
         heav'nly
         habitants
         Begin
         to
         cast
         a
         beam
         on
         th'
         outward
         shape,
         The
         unpolluted
         temple
         of
         the
         mind,
      
      And
      turns
      it
      by
      degrees
      to
      the
      soul's
      essence,
      Till
      all
      be
      made
      immortal:
      but
      when
      lust,
      By
      unchaste
      looks,
      loose
      gestures,
      and
      foul
      talk,
      But
      most
      by
      lewd
      and
      lavish
      act
      of
      sin,
      Lets
      in
      defilement
      to
      the
      inward
      parts,
      The
      soul
      grows
      clotted
      by
      contagion,
      Imbodies,
      and
      imbrutes,
      Till
      she
      quite
      lose
      The
      divine
      property
      of
      her
      first
      being.
      Such
      are
      those
      thick
      and
      gloomy
      shadows
      damp
      Oft
      seen
      in
      charnel
      vaults,
      and
      sepulchres,
      Ling'ring
      and
      sitting
      by
      a
      new
      made
      grave,
      As
      loath
      to
      leave
      the
      body
      that
      it
      lov'd,

      How
      charming
      is
      divine
      philosophy!
      Not
      harsh,
      and
      crabbed,
      as
      dull
      fools
      suppose,
      But
      musical
      as
      is
      Apollo's

      And
      a

      no

      Surpris'd

      Yea
      even

      Shall
      in

      But

      The

      that

      Covering

      Bitter
      constraint,
      and
      sad
      occasion
      dear,
      Compels
      me
      to
      disturb
      your
      season
      due:
      For
      Lycidas
      is
      dead,
      dead
      ere
      his
      prime,
      Young
      Lycidas,
      and
      hath
      not
      left
      his
      peer:
   
   
      Who
      would
      not
      sing
      for
      Lycidas?
      He
      knew
      
         Himself
         to
         sing,
         
            and
            build
            the
            lofty
            rhime.
         
      
   
   
      strictly
      meditate
   
   
      (That
      last
      infirmity

      and
      intrude,

      into

      Of
      other
      care
      they
      little

      scramble
      at
      the

      [hold
      Blind
      mouths!

      recks
      it
      them?
      What
      need
      they?
      They

      when
      they
      list,
      their

      on
      their
      scrannel
      pipes
      of
      wretched
      straw;
      The
      hungry
      sheep
      look
      up,
      and
      are
      not
      fed,
      But
      swoln
      with
      wind,
      and
      the
      rank
      mist
      they
      draw,
      Rot
      inwardly,
      and
      foul
      contagion
      spread;
      Besides
      what
      the
      grim
      wolf
      with
      privy
      paw
      Daily
      devours
      apace,
      and
      nothing
      said;
      But
      that
      two-handed
      engine
      at
      the
      door
      Stands
      ready
      to
      smite
      once,
      and
      smite
      no
      more.

      the

      the

      Where
      more
      is
      meant
      than
      meets
      the

      All
      three
      of

      are
      desperate;
      their
      great
      guilt,
   
   
      
      poison
      given
      to

      a
      great
      time
      after,
   
   
      Now
      'gins

      bite
      the

      Pro.
      A
      devil,
      a
      born
      devil,
      on
      whose
      nature
      Nurture
      can
      never
      stick;
      on
      whom
      my
      pains,
      Humanely
      taken,
      all,
      all
      lost,
      quite
      lost;
      And
      as,
      with
      age,
      his
      body
      uglier
      grows,
      So
      his
      mind
      cankers:
      I
      will
      plague
      them
      all,
   
   
      
         
            In
            virtue

               they
               being
               penitent,
            
         
         The
         sole
         drift
         of

      O!
      wonder!
      How
      many
      goodly
      creatures
      are
      there
      here!
      How
      beauteous
      mankind
      is!
      O
      brave
      new
      world,
      That
      has
      such
      people
      in't!
   
   
      Pro.
      
      
         'Tis
         new
         to
         thee.
      
   
   
      How
      young
      Leander
      crossed
      the
      Hellespont.
   
   
      
      a
      male-content;
  
  
      to
      relish
      a
      love-song,
  
  
      
      a
      robin-
      red-breast;
  
  
      
         to
         walk
         alone,
         
         one
         that
         had
         the
         pestilence
  
  
      
   
   
      not
      welcome.
      I
      reckon
      this
      always—
      that
      a
      man
      is
      never
      undone,
      till
      he
      be
      hanged;
      nor
      never
      welcome
      to
      a
      place,
      till
      some
      certain
      shot
      be
      paid,
      and
      the
   
   
      I
      to
      myself
      am
      dearer
      than
      a
      friend;
   
   
      Lest
      it
      should
      burn
      above
      the
      bounds
      of
      reason.
      Jul.
      The
      more
      thou
      dam'st
      it
      up,
      the
      more
      it
      burns;
      The
      current,
      that
      with
      gentle
      murmur
      glides,
      Thou
      know'st,
      being
      stopped,
      impatiently
      doth
      rage;
      But,
      when
      his
      fair
      course
      is
      not
      hindered,
      He
      makes
      sweet
      music
      with
      th'
      enameled
      stones,
      Giving
      a
      gentle
      kiss
      to
      every
      sedge
      He
      overtaketh
      in
      his
      pilgrimage;
      And
      so
      by
      many
      winding
      nooks
      he
      strays,
      With
      willing
      sport
      to
      the
      wild
      ocean.
      Then
      let
      me
      go,
      and
      hinder
      not
      my
      course:
      I'll
      be
      as
      patient
      as
      a
      gentle
      stream,
      And
      make
      a
      pastime
      of
      each
      weary
      step,
      Till
      the
      last
      step
      have
      brought
      me
      to
      my
      love;
      
         And
         there
         I'll
         rest,
         as,
         after
         much
         turmoil,
         A
         blessed
         soul
         doth
         in
         Elysium.
      
   
   
      To

      a
      virtue
      of
      necessity,
   
   
      Pro.
      
      In
      love,
      Who
      respects
      friend?
   
   
      'Mongst
      all
      foes,
      that
      a
      friend
      should
      be
      the
      worst!
   
   
      
         Who
         by
         repentance
         is
         not
         satisfied,
      
      Is
      nor
      of
      heaven,
      nor
      earth;
      for
      these
      are
      pleased;
   
   
      mind,
      and
      the
      boy
      never
      need
      to
      understand
      any
      thing;
      for
      'tis
      not
      good
      that
      children
      should
      know
      any
      wickedness;
      old
      folks,
      you
      know,
      have
      discretion,
      as
      they
   
   
      peer
      out!
      that
      any
      madness,
      I
      ever
      yet
      beheld,
   
   
      Be
      not
      as
      extreme
      in
      submission
      As
      in
      offence;
   
   
      And
      though
      that
      nature
      with
      a
      beauteous
      wall
      Doth
      oft
      close
      in
      pollution,
      yet
      of
      thee
      I
      will
      believe,
      thou
      hast
      a
      mind
      that
      suits
      With
      this
      thy
      fair
      and
      outward
      character.
      I
      pray
      thee
      and
      I'll
      pay
      thee
      bounteously,
      Conceal
      me
      what
      I
      am;
      and
      be
      my
      aid
      For
      such
      disguise
      as,
      haply,
      shall
      become
      The
      form
      of
      my
      intent.
      I'll
      serve
      this
      duke;
      Thou
      shalt
      present
      me
      as
      an
      eunuch
      to
      him;
      It
      may
      be
      worth
      thy
      pains;
      for
      I
      can
      sing,

      The
      more
      fool
      you,
      madonna,
      to
      mourn
      for
      your
      brother's
      soul

      O,
      you
      are
      sick
      of
      self-love,
      Malvolio,
      and
      taste
      with
      a
      distempered
      appetite.
      To
      be
      generous,
      guiltless
      and
      of
      free
      disposition,
      is
      to
      take
      those
      things
      for
      bird-bolts,
      that
      you
      deem
      cannon-bullets:
      There
      is
      no
      slander
      in
      an
      allowed
      fool,
      though
      he
      do
      nothing
      but
      rail;
      nor
      no
      railing
      in
      a
      known
      discreet
      man,
      though
      he
      do
      nothing
      but
      reprove.
   
   
      Unless
      the
      master
      were
      the
      man.
      —How
      now?
      Even
      so
      quickly
      may
      one
      catch
      the
      plague?
   
   
      Fate,
      show
      thy
      force:
      ourselves
      we
      do
      not
      owe;
      What
      is
      decreed,
      must
      be;
      and
      be
      this
      so!

      How
      easy
      is
      it
      for
      the
      proper-false
      In
      women's
      waxen
      hearts
      to
      set

      Alas,
      our
      frailty
      is
      the

      and
      low:
      Trip
      no
      farther,
      pretty

      Journeys
      end

      What's

      still
      unsure:
      In
      delay
      there
      lies
      no

      Then
      come

      sweet-and-twenty,

      Dost
      thou
      think,
      because
      thou
      art
      virtuous,
      there
      shall

      since
      the

      to

      An
      elder
      than
      herself;
      so

      For,
      boy,
      however
      we
      do
      praise
      ourselves,
      Our

      Having
      been
      three
      months
      married
      to
      her,
      sitting
      in
      my

      Sir

      O,
      for
      a
      stone
      bow,
      to
      hit
      him
      in

      Calling
      my
      officers
      about
      me,
      in
      my
      branched
      velvet

      having
      come
      from
      a

      I
      left

      peace!

      And
      then
      to
      have
      the
      humor
      of
      state:

      after
      a

      my

      as
      I
      would
      they
      should
      do

         up
         my
         watch,
         or
         play

         my
         some
         rich
         jewel.

      Shall
      this

         extend
         my
         hand
         to
         him
         thus,
         quenching
         my
         familiar
         smile
         with
         an
         austere

      Mr.
      R.P.
      Knight
      conjectures
      that
      this
      is

      corruption
      of
      Stratici,
      a
      title
      anciently
      given
      to
      the
      Governors
      of

      not

      If
      so,
      it

      of
      Verona,

      that
      well,
      craves
      a

      I
      know
      of

      I
      hate
      ingratitude

      lying,

      the
      unkind:

      were

      me
      in
      darkness,
      send
      ministers
      to
      me,
      asses,

      all

      can

      me

      An
      you
      smile
      not,
      he's
      gagged:
      And
      thus
      the

      for
      themselves:
      for
      if
      our
      virtues
      Did
      not
      go
      forth

      us,

      The

      loved
      
         the

      strength;

      and
      tender

      hast,
      forget'st.
      Thou

      a

      age;
      But,
      as
      it
      were,
      an
      after-dinner's
      sleep,
      Dreaming
      on

      for
      all
      thy
      blessed
      youth
      Becomes

      alms
      Of
      palsied

      and
      when
      thou
      art
      old,
      and
      rich,
      Thou
      hast
      neither
      heat,

      Duke.
      O,
      death's
      a
      great
      disguiser:
      and
      you
      may
   
   
      Abhor.
      Sirrah,
      bring
      Barnardine
      hither.
      Clo.
      Master
      Barnardine!
      You
      must
      rise
      and
      be
      hanged,
      master
      Barnardine!
      Abhor.
      What,
      ho,
      Barnardine!
      Barnar.
      [Within.]
      A
      pox
      o'
      your
      throats!
      Who
      makes
      that
      noise
      there?
      What
      are
      you?
      Clo.
      Your
      friends,
      sir;
      the
      hangman:
      you
      must
      be
      so
      good,
      sir,
      to
      rise
      and
      be
      put
      to
      death.
      Barnar.
      [Within.]
      Away,
      you
      rogue,
      away;
      I
      am
      sleepy.
      Abhor.
      Tell
      him,
      he
      must
      awake,
      and
      that
      quickly
      too.
      Clo.
      Pray,
      master
      Barnardine,
      awake
      till
      you
      are
      executed,
      and
      sleep
      afterwards.
      Abhor.
      Go
      in
      to
      him,
      and
      fetch
      him
      out.
      Clo.
      He
      is
      coming,
      sir,
      he
      is
      coming;
      I
      hear
      his
      straw
      rustle.
   
   
      Clo.
      O,
      the
      better,
      sir;
      for
      he
      that
      drinks
      all
      night,
      and
      is
      hanged
      betimes
      in
      the
      morning,
      may
      sleep
      the
      sounder
      all
      the
      next
      day.
   
   
      Duke.
      This
      nor
      hurts
      him,
      nor
      profits
      you
      a
      jot:
   
   
      For
      my
      authority
      bears
      a
      credent
      bulk,
      That
      no
      particular
      scandal
      once
      can
      touch,
      But
      it
      confounds
      the
      breather.
      He
      should
      have
      lived,
      Save
      that
      his
      riotous
      youth,
      with
      dangerous
      sense,
   
   
      Duke.
      Away
      with
      her:
      —poor
      soul.
      She
      speaks
      this
      in
      the
      infirmity
      of
      sense.
      Isab.
      O
      prince,
      I
      conjure
      thee,
      as
      thou
      believest
      There
      is
      another
      comfort
      than
      this
      world,
      That
      thou
      neglect
      me
      not,
      with
      that
      opinion
      
         That
         I
         am
         touched
         with
         madness:
      
      make
      not
      impossible
      That
      which
      but
      seems
      un:
      'tis
      not
      impossible
   
   
      But
      one,
      the
      wicked'st
      caitiff
      on
      the
      ground,
      May
      seem
      as
      shy,
      as
      grave,
      as
      just,
      as
      absolute,
      As
      Angelo;
      even
      so
      may
      Angelo,
   
   
      To
      speak
      before
      your
      time.
      —Proceed.
      Isab.
      I
      went
      To
      this
      pernicious
      caitiff
      deputy.
   
   
      That's
      somewhat
      madly
      spoken.
   
   
      Isab.
      O,
      that
      it
      were
      as
      
      as
      it
      is
      true!
   
   
      Where
      I
      have
      seen
      corruption
      boil
      and
      bubble,
      Till
      it
      o'errun
      the
      stew;
      laws,
      for
      all
      faults;
      But
      faults
      so
      countenanced,
      that
      the
      strong
      statutes
      Stand
      
      the
      forfeits
      in
      a
      barber's
      shop,
      As
      much
      in
      mock
      as
      mark.
   
   
      Which
      I
      did
      think
      with
      slower
      foot
      came
      on,
      That
      brained
      my
      purpose:
      but
      peace
      be
      with
      him!
      That
      life
      is
      better
      life,
      past
      fearing
      death,
      Than
      that
      which
      lives
      to
      fear:
      make
      it
      your
      comfort,
      So
      happy
      is
      your
      brother.
   
   
      Sweet
      Isabel,
      do
      yet
      but
      kneel
      by
      me;
      Hold
      up
      your
      hands;
      say
      nothing;
      I'll
      speak
      all.
      They
      say,
      best
      men
      are
      moulded
      out
      of
      faults;
      And,
      for
      the
      most,
      become
      much
      more
      the
      better
      For
      being
      a
      little
      bad:
      so
      may
      my
      husband.
   
   
      Let
      him
      not
      die:
      My
      brother
      had
      but
      justice,
      In
      that
      he
      did
      the
      thing
      for
      which
      he
      died:
      For
      Angelo,
      His
      act
      did
      not
      o'ertake
      his
      bad
      intent;
      And
      must
      be
      buried
      but
      as
      an
      intent
      That
      perished
      by
      the
      way:
      thoughts
      are
      no
      subjects;
      Intents
      but
      merely
      thoughts.

      A
      kind
      overflow
      of
      kindness:
      there
      are
      no
      faces
      truer

      those
      that
      are
      so

      How
      much
      better
      it
      is
      to
      weep
      at
      joy,
      than
      to
      joy
      at
      weeping!
   
   
      hath
      he
      killed
      and
      eaten
      in
      these
      wars?
      But
      how
      many
      hath
      he
      killed?
      For,
      indeed,
      I
      promised
      to
      eat
      all
      of
      his
      killing.

      Faith,
      niece,
      you
      tax
      seignior
      Benedick
      too
   
   
      Bene.
      What,
      
         my
         dear
         lady
         Disdain!
      
      —Are
      you
      yet
      living?
   
   
      as
      the
      first
      of
      May
      doth
      the
      last
      of
      December.
      But
      I
      hope
      you
      have
      no
      intent
      to
      turn
      husband;
      have
      you?

      one

      but
      he
      will
      wear
      his
      cap
      with
      suspicion?
      Shall
      I
      never
      see
      a

      of
      threescore

      Go
      to,
      i'faith;

      wilt
      needs
      thrust
      thy
      neck
      into
      a
      yoke,
      wear

      print
      of
      it,
      and

      away
   
   
      Sundays.
      Look,

      Bene.
      That
      a
      woman
      conceived
      me,
      I
      thank
      her;
      that
      she
      brought
      me
      up,
      I
      wise
      give
      her
      most
      humble
      thanks;
      but
      that
      I
      will
      have
      a
      recheat
      winded
      in
      my
      forehead,
      or
      hang
      my
      bugle
      in
      an
      invisible
      baldrick,
      all
      women
      shall
      pardon
      me:
      because
      I
      will
      not
      do
      them
      the
      wrong
      to
      mistrust
      any,
      I
      will
      do
      myself
      the
      right
      to
      trust
      none;
      and
      the
      fine
      is,
      (for
      the
      which
      I
      may
   
   
      D.
      John.
      I
      wonder,
      that
      thou,
      being
      (as
      thou
      say'st
      thou
      art)
      born
      under
      Saturn,
      goest
      about
      to
      apply
      a
      moral
      medicine
      to
      a
      mortifying
      mischief.
      I
      cannot
      hide
      what
      I
      am:
      I
      must
      be
      sad
      when
      I
      have
      cause,
      and
      smile
      at
      no
      man's
      jests;
      eat
      when
      I
      have
      stomach,
      and
      wait
      for
      no
      man's
      leisure;
      sleep
      when
      I
      am
      drowsy,
   
   
      and
      say,
      Get
      you
      to
      heaven,
      Beatrice,
      get
      you
      to
      heaven;
      here's
      no
      place
      for
      you
      maids:
      so
      deliver
      I
      up
      my
      apes,
      and
      away
      to
      Saint
      Peter
      for
      the
      heavens;
      he
      shows
      me
      where
      the
      bachelors
      sit,
      and
      there
      live
      we
      as
      merry
      as
      the
      day
      is
      long.
   
   
      wooing,
      wedding,
      and
      repenting,
      is
      as
      a
      Scotch
      jig,
      a
      measure,
      and
      a
      cinque-pace;
      the
      first
      suit
      is
      hot
      and
      hasty,
      
      a
      Scotch
      jig,
      and
      full
      as
      fantastical;
      the
      wedding,
      mannerly-modest,
      as
      a
      measure
      full
      of
      state
      and
      ancientry;
      and
      then
      comes
      repentance,
      and,
      with
      his
      bad
      legs,
      falls
      into
      the
      cinque-pace
      faster
      and
      faster,
      till
      he
      sink
      into
      his
      grave.
   
   
      Claud.
      Thus
      answer
      I
      in
      name
      of
      Benedick,
      But
      hear
      these
      ill
      news
      with
      the
      ears
      of
      Claudio.—
      'Tis
      certain
      so;
      —the
      prince
      wooes
      for
      himself.
      Friendship
      is
      constant
      in
      all
      other
      things,
      Save
      in
      the
      office
      and
      affairs
      of
      love:
      Therefore,
      all
      hearts
      in
      love
      use
      their
      own
      tongues;
      Let
      every
      eye
      negotiate
      for
      itself,
      And
      trust
      no
      agent;
      for
      beauty
      is
      a
      witch,
      Against
      whose
      charms
      faith
      melteth
      into
      blood.
      This
      is

      It
      is
      the
      witness
      still
      of
      excellency,
      To
      put
      a
      strange
      face
      on
      his
      own

      Hero.
      O
      God
      of
      love!
      I
      know,
      he
      doth
      deserve
      As
      much
      as
      may
      be
      yielded
      to
      a
      man;
      But
      nature
      never
      framed
      a
      woman's
      heart
      Of
      prouder
      stuff
      than
      that
      of
      Beatrice.
      Disdain
      and
      scorn
      ride
      sparkling
      in
      her
      eyes,
      Misprising
      what
      they
      look
      on;
      and
      her
      wit
      Values
      itself
      so
      highly,
      that
      to
      her
      All
      matter
      else
      seems
      weak.
      She
      cannot
      love,
      Nor
      take
      no
      shape
      nor
      project
      of
      affection,
   
   
      To
      stain
      my
      cousin
      with;
      one
      doth
      not
      know,
      How
      much
      an
      ill
      word
      may
      empoison
      liking.
   
   
      And,
      Benedick,
      love
      on;
      I
      will
      requite
      thee;
      Taming
      my
      wild
      heart
      to
      thy
      loving
      hand;
   
   
      any
      villany
      should
      be
      so
      rich;
      for
      when
      rich
      villains
      have
      need
      of
      poor
      ones,
      poor

      they
      will.

      There,
      Leonato,
      take
      her
      back
      again.
      Give
      not
      this
      rotten
      orange
      to
      your
      friend:
      She's
      but
      the
      sign
      and
      semblance
      of
      her
      honor.
      Behold,
      how
      
      a
      maid
      she
      blushes
      here.
      O,
      what
      authority
      and
      show
      of
      truth
      Can
      cunning
      sin
      cover
      itself
      withal!
      Comes
      not
      that
      blood,
      as
      modest
      evidence,
      To
      witness
      simple
      virtue?
      Would
      you
      not
      swear,
      All
      you
      that
      see
      her,
      that
      she
      were
      a
      maid,
      By
      these
      exterior
      shows?—
      But
      she
      is
      none.
      She
      knows
      the
      heat
      of
      a
      luxurious
      bed;
      Her
      blush
      is
      guiltiness,
      not
      modesty.
   
   
      Shall
      be
      lamented,
      pitied,
      and
      excused,
      Of
      every
      hearer;
      for
      it
      so
      falls
      out,
      That
      what
      we
      have,
      we
      prize
      not
      to
      the
      worth,
      Whiles
      we
      enjoy
      it;
      but
      being
      lacked
      and
      lost,
      Why,
      then
      we
      rack
      the
      value;
      then
      we
      find
      The
      virtue,
      that
      possession
      would
      not
      show
      us
   
   
      Nor
      let
      no
      comforter
      delight
      mine
      ear,
      But
      such
      a
      one
      whose
      wrongs
      do
      suit
      with
      mine.
      Bring
      me
      a
      father,
      that
      so
      loved
      his
      child,
      Whose
      joy
      of
      her
      is
      overwhelmed
      
      mine,
      And
      bid
      him
      speak
      of
      patience;
      Measure
      his
      woe
      the
      length
      and
      breadth
      of
      mine,
      And
      let
      it
      answer
      every
      strain
      for
      strain;
      As
      thus
      for
      thus,
      and
      such
      a
      grief
      for
      such,
      In
      every
      lineament,
      branch,
      shape,
      and
      form.
      If
      such
      a
      one
      will
      smile,
      and
      stroke
      his
      beard;
      
         Cry—
         sorrow,
         wag!
         and
         hem,
         when
         he
         should
         groan;
         
            Patch
            grief
            with
            proverbs;
         
         make
         misfortune
         drunk
      
      With
      
         candle-wasters;
      
      bring
      him
      yet
      to
      me,
      And
      I
      of
      him
      will
      gather
      patience.
      But
      there
      is
      no
      such
      man;
      for,
      brother,
      men
      Can
      counsel,
      and
      speak
      comfort
      to
      that
      grief
      Which
      they
      themselves
      not
      feel;
      but,
      tasting
      it,
      Their
      counsel
      turns
      to
      passion,
      which
      before
      Would
      give
      preceptial
      medicine.

      No,
      no;
      'tis
      all
      men's
      office
      to
      speak

      To
      those
      that
      wring
      under
      the
      load
      of

      no

      shall
      endure

      Therefore
      give
      me
      no

      cry

      peace.
      I
      will
      be
      flesh

      blood;
      For
      there
      was

      That
      could
      endure
      the
      tooth-ache

      However
      they
      have
      writ
      the
      style
      of
      gods,
      And
      made
      a
      push
      at

      Her
      height,
      forsooth,
      she
      hath

         so

      I?
      I

      not
      yet
      so
      low,
      But

      reach
      unto
      thine

      Hel.
      I
      pray
      you,
      though
      you
      mock
      me,
      gentlemen,
      Let
      her
      not
      hurt
      me.
      I
      was
      never
      curst;
      
         I
         have
         no
         gift
         at
         all
         in
         shrewishness;
      
      I
      am
      a
      right
      maid
      for
      my
      cowardice;
      
         Let
         her
         not
         strike
         me.
         
            You,
            perhaps,
            may
            think,
            Because
            she's
            something
            lower
            than
            myself,
            That
            I
            can
            match
            her.

         Lower!
         Hark,

         Good
         Hermia,
         do
         not
         be
         so
         bitter
         with
         me.
         I
         evermore
         did
         love
         you,
         Hermia,
         Did
         ever
         keep
         your
         counsels,
         never
         wronged
         you;
         Save
         that,
         in
         love
         unto
         Demetrius,
         I
         told
         him
         of
         your
         stealth
         unto
         this
         wood.
         He
         followed
         you;
         for
         love,
         I
         followed
         him.
         But
         he
         hath
         chid
         me
         hence,
         and
         threatened
         me
         To
         strike
         me,
         spurn
         me,
         nay,
         to
         kill
         me
         too:
         And
         now,
         so
         you
         will
         let
         me
         quiet
         go,
         To
         Athens
         will
         I
         bear
         my
         folly
         back,
         And
         follow
         you
         no
         farther.
         Let
         me
         go:
         You
         see
         how
         simple
         and
         how

      and
      nay,
      sir,
      then
      I
      swore
      in
      jest.
      What
      is
      the
      end
      of
      study?
      Let
      me
      know.
      King.
      Why,
      that
      to
      know,
      which
      else
      we
      should
      not
      know.
      Biron.
      Things
      hid
      and
      barred,
      you
      mean,
      from
      common
      sense?
      King.
      Ay,
      that
      is
      study's
      god
      recompense.
      Biron.
      Come
      on
      then;
      I
      will
      swear
      to
      study
      so,
      To
      know
      the
      thing
      I
      am
      forbid
      to
      know.
      As
      thus—
      To
      study
      where
      I
      well
      may
      dine,
      When
      I
      to
      feast
      expressly
      am
      forbid;
   
   
      And
      train
      our
      intellects
      to
      vain
      delight.
      Biron.
      Why,
      all
      delights
      are
      vain;
      but
      that
      most
      vain,
      Which,
      with
      pain
      purchased,
      doth
      inherit
      pain.

         but
         fame;
      
      And
      every
      godfather
      can
      give
      a

      Most
      mischievous,
      foul

      Truly,
      shepherd,
      in
      respect
      of
      itself,
      it
      is
      a
      good
      life;
      but
      in
      respect
      that
      it
      is
      a
      shepherd's
      life,
      it
      is
      naught.
      In
      respect
      that
      it
      is
      solitary,
      I
      
      it
      very
      well;
      but
      in
      respect
      that
      it
      is
      private,
      it
      is
      a
      very
      vile
      life.
      Now,
      in
      respect
      it
      is
      in
      the
      fields,
      it
      pleaseth
      me
      well;
      but
      in
      respect
      it
      is
      not
      in
      the
      court,
      it
      is
      tedious.
      As
      it
      is
      a
      spare
      life,
      look
      you,
      it
      fits
      my
      humor
      well;
      but
      as
      there
      is
      no
      more
      plenty
      in
      it,
      it
      goes
      much
      against
      my
      stomach.

      any
      philosophy

      thee,

      full

      and
      for
      no
      passion

      any
      thing,
      as

      the

      humorous
      sadness.

      By
      my
      faith,
      you
      have
      great
      reason
      to
      be

      have
      sold
      your
      own
      lands,
      to
      see
      other

      then,
      to
      have
      seen
      much,

      to
      have
      nothing,
      is"
      to

      the
      duke
      to
      the
      nuptial.
      But,
      O,
      how
      bitter
      a
      thing
      it
      is
      to

      Did
      you
      not
      of

      hear
      A

      spice
      of
      your
      hypocrisy.
      
         You,

         Which,
         to

      it.

      it

      of
      your

      I

      had
      to
      him
      derived
      your

      I
      Continue
      in
      my

      nay,

      Sir,
      call
      to
      mind
   
   
      To
      oppose
      your
      cunning.
      You
      are
      meek
      and
      humble
      mouthed;
      You
      sign
      your
      place
      and
      calling,
      in
      full
      seeming,
      With
      meekness
      and
      humility;
      but
      your
      heart
      Is
      crammed
      with
      arrogancy,
      spleen,
      and
      pride.
      You
      have,
      by
      fortune,
      and
      his
      highness'
      favors,
   
   
      I
      have
      more
      charity.
      But
      say,
      I
      warned
      ye;
      
         Take
         heed,
         for
         Heaven's
         sake,
         take
         heed,
         lest
         at
         once
         The
         burden
         of
         my
         sorrows
         fall
         upon
         ye.
      
   
   
      Make

         A

      an
      archbishop.
   
   
      
         A
         
            spleeny
         
         Lutheran;
      
      and
      not
      wholesome
      to
   
   
      What
      sudden
      anger's
      this?
      how
      have
      I
      reaped
      it?
      He
      parted
      frowning
      from
      me,
      as
      if
      ruin
      Leaped
      from
      his
      eyes.
      So
      looks
      the
      chafed
      lion
      Upon
      the
      daring
      huntsman
      that
      has
      galled
      him;
      Then
      makes
      him
      nothing.
      I
      must
      read
      this
      paper;
      I
      fear,
      the
      story
      of
      his
      anger.
      'Tis
      so;
      This
      paper
      has
      undone
      me:—
      'Tis
      the
      account
      Of
      all
      that
      world
      of

      have
      drawn
      together

      indeed,
      to
      gain

      And
      fee
      my
      friends

      O
      negligence,
      Fit
      for
      a
      fool
      to
      fall
      by!
      What
      cross
      devil
      Made

      secret

      I
      sent
      the
      king?
      Is
      there
      no
      way
      to
      cure
      this?
      No
      new
      device
      to
      beat
      this
      from
      his
      brains?
      I
      know
      'twill
      stir
      him

      Yet
      I
      know
      A

      it

      right,
      in

      What's
      this?

      glory,
      I
      haste
      now
      to

      I

      a
      bright
      exhalation
      in

      My
      name
      is
      Caius
      Marcius,
      who
      hath
      done
      To
      thee
      particularly,
      and
      to
      all
      the
      Volces,
      Great
      hurt
      and
      mischief;
      thereto
      witness
      may
      My
      surname,
      Coriolanus.
      The
      painful
      service,
      The
      extreme
      dangers,
      and
      the
      drops
      of
      blood
      Shed
      for
      my
      thankless
      country,
      are
      requited
      But
      with
      that
      surname;
      a
      good
      memory,
      And
      witness
      of
      the
      malice
      and
      displeasure
      Which
      thou
      shouldst
      hear
      me.
      Only
      that
      name
      remains;
      The
      cruelty
      and
      envy
      of
      the
      people,
      Permitted
      by
      our
      dastard
      nobles,
      who
      Have
      all
      forsook
      me,
      hath
      devoured
      the
      rest;
      And
      suffered
      me
      by
      the
      voice
      of
      slaves
      to
      be
      Whooped
      out
      of
      Rome.
      Now,
      this
      extremity
      Hath
      brought
      me
      to
      thy
      hearth;
      not
      out
      of
      hope—
      Mistake
      me
      not
      to
      save
      my
      life;
      for
      if
      I
      had
      feared
      death,
      of
      all
      the
      men
      i'
      the
      world
      I
      would
      have
      'voided
      thee;
      but
      in
      mere
      spite,
   
   
      Stand
      I
      before
      thee
      here.
      Then
      if
      thou
      hast
      A
      heart
      of
      wreak
      in
      thee,
      that
      will
      revenge
      Thine
      own
      particular
      wrongs,
      and
      stop
      those
      maims
      Of
      shame
      seen
      through
      thy
      country,
      speed
      thee
      straight,
      And
      make
      my
      misery
      serve
      thy
      turn;
      so
      use
      it,
      That
      my
      revengeful
      services
      may
      prove
      As
      benefits
      to
      thee;
      for
      I
      will
      fight
      Against
      my
      cankered
      country
      with
      the
      spleen
      Of
      all
      the
      under-fiends.
      But
      if
      so
      be
      Thou
      dar'st
      not
      this,
      and
      that
      to
      prove
      more
      fortunes
      Thou
      art
      tired,
      then,
      in
      a
      word,
      I
      also
      am
      Longer
      to
      live
      most
      weary,
      and
      present
      My
      throat
      to
      thee,
      and
      to
      thy
      ancient
      malice;
      Which
      not
      to
      cut,
      would
      show
      thee
      but
      a
      fool;
      Since
      I
      have
      ever
      followed
      thee
      with
      hate,
      Drawn
      tuns
      of
      blood
      out
      of
      thy
      country's
      breast,
      And
      cannot
      live
      but
      to
      thy
      shame,
      unless
      It
      be
      to
      do
      thee
      service.
      Auf.
      O
      Marcius,
      Marcius,
      Each
      word
      thou
      hast
      spoke
      hath
      weeded
      from
      my
      heart
      A
      root
      of
      ancient
      envy.
      If
      Jupiter
      Should
      from
      yon
      cloud
      speak
      divine
      things,
      and
      say,
      'Tis
      true;
      I'd
      not
      believe
      them
      more
      than
      thee,
      All
      noble
      Marcius.—
      O,
      let
      me
      twine
      Mine
      arms
      about
      that
      body,
      where
      against
      My
      grained
      ash
      an
      hundred
      times
      hath
      broke,
      And
      scarred
      the
      moon
      with
      splinters!
      Here
      I
      clip
      The
      anvil
      of
      my
      sword;
      and
      do
      contest
      As
      hotly
      and
      as
      nobly
      with
      thy
      love,
      As
      ever
      in
      ambitious
      strength
      I
      did
      Contend
      against
      thy
      valor.
      Know
      thou
      first,
      I
      love
      the
      maid
      I
      married;
      never
      man
      Sighed
      truer
      breath;
      but
      that
      I
      see
      thee
      here,
      Thou
      noble
      thing!
      more
      dances
      my
      rapt
      heart,
      Than
      when
      I
      first
      my
      wedded
      mistress
      saw
      Bestride
      my
      threshold.
      Why,
      thou
      Mars!
      I
      tell
      thee,
   
   
      Caes.
      What
      say'st
      thou
      to
      me
      now?
      Speak
      once
      again.
      Sooth.
      Beware
      the
      ides
      of
      March.
   
   
      Merely
      upon
      myself.
      Vexed
      I
      am,
      Of
      late,
      with
      passions
      of
      some
      difference,
      
         Conceptions
         only
         proper
         to
         myself,
      
      Which
      give
      some
      soil,
      perhaps,
      to
      my
      behaviors;
      But
      let
      not
      therefore
      my
      good
      friends
      be
      grieved,
   
   
      Cas.
      Ay,
      do
      you
      fear
      it?
      Then
      must
      I
      think
      you
      would
      not
      have
      it
      so.
   
   
      I
      cannot
      tell
      what
      you
      and
      other
      men
      Think
      of
      this
      life;
      but,
      for
      my
      single
      self,
   
   
      he
      offered
      it
      the
      third
      time;
      he
      put
      it
      the
      third
      time
      by;
      .and
      still,
      as
      he
      refused
      it,
      the
      rabblement
      hooted,
      and
      clapped
      their
      chapped
      hands,
      and
      threw
      up
      their
      sweaty
      night-caps,
      and
      uttered

      then;
      Cassius
      from
      bondage
      will
      deliver
      Cassius:
      Therein,
      ye
      gods,
      you
      make
      the
      weak
      most

      Therein,

      you
      tyrants

      defeat:
      Nor

      links
      of
      iron,
      Can
      be
      retentive
      to
      the
      strength
      of

      But
      life,
      being
      weary
      of
      these
      worldly
      bars,
      Never

      not

      But,
      alas,

      .Ay,
      sir;

      and
      Antony,
      Enthroned
      in
      the
      market-place,
      did
      sit
      alone,
      Whistling
      to
      the
      air;
      which,
      but
      for
      vacancy,
      Had
      gone
      to
      gaze
      on
      Cleopatra
      too,
      And
      made
      a
      gap
      in
      nature.
   
   
      Therefore,
      O
      Antony,
      stay
      not
      by
      his
      side.
      Thy
      demon,

      thy
      spirit

      keeps
      thee,

      courageous,

      unmatchable,
      Where
      Caesar's
      is
      not;
      but
      near
      him,
      thy
      angel
      Becomes
      a
      Fear,
      as
      being
      overpowered:

      I

      you,
      look
      not
      sad,
      Nor
      make
      replies
      of
      loathness.

      Which
      my

      A

      there

            bad,
            but
            thinking

      O
      God!
      I
      could
      be
      bounded
      in
      a
      nutshell,
      and
      count
      myself

      were
      it
      not
      that
      I
      have
      bad
      dreams.
      Guil.
      Which
      dreams,
      indeed,
      are
      ambition;
      for
      the
      very
      substance
      of
      the
      ambitious
      is
      merely
      the
      shadow
      of
      a
      dream.

      A
      dream
      itself
      is

      a

      Truly;
      and
      I
      hold
      ambition
      of
      so
      airy
      and
      light
      a
      quality,
      that
      it
      is

      But,
      what
      we
      do
      determine
      oft
      we
      break.
      Purpose
      is
      but
      the

      Of
      violent

      fruit
      unripe,

      But
      fall,
      unshaken,
      when
      they
      mellow
      be.
      Most
      necessary
      'tis,
      that
      we
      forget
      To
      pay
      ourselves
      what
      to
      ourselves
      is
      debt.
      What
      to
      ourselves
      in
      passion
      we
      propose,
   
   
      The
      poor

      enemies.
   
   
      For
      who
      not
      needs,
      shall
      never
      lack
      a
      friend;
   
   
      And
      who
      in
      want
      a
      hollow
      friend
      doth
      try,
      Directly

      him
      his
      enemy.
