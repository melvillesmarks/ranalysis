         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	The king of Navarre's park.
         
         
         	[Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE
         	and DUMAIN]
         
         FERDINAND	Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
         	Live registered upon our brazen tombs
         	And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
         	When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
         	The endeavor of this present breath may buy
         	That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
         	And make us heirs of all eternity.
         	Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
         	That war against your own affections
         	And the huge army of the world's desires,--
         	Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
         	Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
         	Our court shall be a little Academe,
         	Still and contemplative in living art.
         	You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
         	Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
         	My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
         	That are recorded in this schedule here:
         	Your oaths are passed; and now subscribe your names,
         	That his own hand may strike his honour down
         	That violates the smallest branch herein:
         	If you are armed to do as sworn to do,
         	Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
         
         LONGAVILLE	I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
         	The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
         	Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
         	Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
         
         DUMAIN	My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
         	The grosser manner of these world's delights
         	He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
         	To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
         	With all these living in philosophy.
         
         BIRON	I can but say their protestation over;
         	So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
         	That is, to live and study here three years.
         	But there are other strict observances;
         	As, not to see a woman in that term,
         	Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
         	And one day in a week to touch no food
         	And but one meal on every day beside,
         	The which I hope is not enrolled there;
         	And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
         	And not be seen to wink of all the day--
         	When I was wont to think no harm all night
         	And make a dark night too of half the day--
         	Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
         	O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
         	Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
         
         FERDINAND	Your oath is passed to pass away from these.
         
         BIRON	Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
         	I only swore to study with your grace
         	And stay here in your court for three years' space.
         
         LONGAVILLE	You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
         
         BIRON	By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
         	What is the end of study? let me know.
         
         FERDINAND	Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
         
         BIRON	Things hid and barred, you mean, from common sense?
         
         FERDINAND	Ay, that is study's god recompense.
         
         BIRON	Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
         	To know the thing I am forbid to know:
         	As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
         	When I to feast expressly am forbid;
         	Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
         	When mistresses from common sense are hid;
         	Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
         	Study to break it and not break my troth.
         	If study's gain be thus and this be so,
         	Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
         	Swear me to this, and I will never say no.
         
         FERDINAND	These be the stops that hinder study quite
         	And train our intellects to vain delight.
         
         BIRON	Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
         	Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
         	As, painfully to pore upon a book
         	To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
         	Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
         	Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
         	So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
         	Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
         	Study me how to please the eye indeed
         	By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
         	Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
         	And give him light that it was blinded by.
         	Study is  the heaven's glorious sun
         	That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks:
         	Small have continual plodders ever won
         	Save base authority from others' books
         	These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
         	That give a name to every fixed star
         	Have no more profit of their shining nights
         	Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
         	Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
         	And every godfather can give a name.
         
         FERDINAND	How well he's read, to reason against reading!
         
         DUMAIN	Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
         
         LONGAVILLE	He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
         
         BIRON	The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
         
         DUMAIN	How follows that?
         
         BIRON	                  Fit in his place and time.
         
         DUMAIN	In reason nothing.
         
         BIRON	                  Something then in rhyme.
         
         FERDINAND	Biron is  an envious sneaping frost,
         	That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
         
         BIRON	Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
         	Before the birds have any cause to sing?
         	Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
         	At Christmas I no more desire a rose
         	Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
         	But  of each thing that in season grows.
         	So you, to study now it is too late,
         	Climb over the house to unlock the little gate.
         
         FERDINAND	Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.
         
         BIRON	No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
         	And though I have for barbarism spoke more
         	Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
         	Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
         	And bide the penance of each three years' day.
         	Give me the paper; let me read the same;
         	And to the strictest decrees I'll write my name.
         
         FERDINAND	How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
         
         BIRON	[Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within a
         	mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
         
         LONGAVILLE	Four days ago.
         
         BIRON	Let's see the penalty.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
         
         LONGAVILLE	Marry, that did I.
         
         BIRON	Sweet lord, and why?
         
         LONGAVILLE	To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
         
         BIRON	A dangerous law against gentility!
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
         	within the term of three years, he shall endure such
         	public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
         	This article, my liege, yourself must break;
         	For well you know here comes in embassy
         	The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
         	A maid of grace and complete majesty--
         	About surrender up of Aquitaine
         	To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
         	Therefore this article is made in vain,
         	Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.
         
         FERDINAND	What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
         
         BIRON	So study evermore is overshot:
         	While it doth study to have what it would
         	It doth forget to do the thing it should,
         	And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
         	'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.
         
         FERDINAND	We must of force dispense with this decree;
         	She must lie here on mere necessity.
         
         BIRON	Necessity will make us all forsworn
         	Three thousand times within this three years' space;
         	For every man with his affects is born,
         	Not by might mastered but by special grace:
         	If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
         	I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
         	So to the laws at large I write my name:
         
         	[Subscribes]
         
         	And he that breaks them in the least degree
         	Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
         	Suggestions are to other as to me;
         	But I believe, although I seem so loath,
         	I am the last that will last keep his oath.
         	But is there no quick recreation granted?
         
         FERDINAND	Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
         	With a refined traveller of Spain;
         	A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
         	That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
         	One whom the music of his own vain tongue
         	Doth ravish  enchanting harmony;
         	A man of complements, whom right and wrong
         	Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
         	This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
         	For interim to our studies shall relate
         	In high-born words the worth of many a knight
         	From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
         	How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
         	But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
         	And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
         
         BIRON	Armado is a most illustrious wight,
         	A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
         
         LONGAVILLE	Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
         	And so to study, three years is but short.
         
         	[Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD]
         
         DULL	Which is the duke's own person?
         
         BIRON	This, fellow: what wouldst?
         
         DULL	I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
         	grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
         	in flesh and blood.
         
         BIRON	This is he.
         
         DULL	Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
         	abroad: this letter will tell you more.
         
         COSTARD	Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
         
         FERDINAND	A letter from the magnificent Armado.
         
         BIRON	How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
         
         LONGAVILLE	A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
         
         BIRON	To hear? or forbear laughing?
         
         LONGAVILLE	To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
         	forbear both.
         
         BIRON	Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
         	climb in the merriness.
         
         COSTARD	The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
         	The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
         
         BIRON	In what manner?
         
         COSTARD	In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
         	I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
         	her upon the form, and taken following her into the
         	park; which, put together, is in manner and form
         	following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
         	manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
         	in some form.
         
         BIRON	For the following, sir?
         
         COSTARD	As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
         	the right!
         
         FERDINAND	Will you hear this letter with attention?
         
         BIRON	As we would hear an oracle.
         
         COSTARD	Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
         
         FERDINAND	[Reads]  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
         	sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
         	and body's fostering patron.'
         
         COSTARD	Not a word of Costard yet.
         
         FERDINAND	[Reads]  'So it is,'--
         
         COSTARD	It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
         	telling true, but so.
         
         FERDINAND	Peace!
         
         COSTARD	Be to me and every man that dares not fight!
         
         FERDINAND	No words!
         
         COSTARD	Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
         
         FERDINAND	[Reads]  'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
         	melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
         	to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
         	air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
         	walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
         	beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
         	to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
         	for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
         	I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
         	for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
         	that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
         	from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
         	here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
         	but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
         	and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
         	knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited

         FERDINAND	[Reads]  'that shallow vassal,'--
         
         COSTARD	Still me?
         
         FERDINAND	[Reads]  'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--
         
         COSTARD	O, me!
         
         FERDINAND	[Reads]  'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy

         BIRON	This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
         	that ever I heard.
         
         FERDINAND	Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
         	you to this?
         
         COSTARD	Sir, I confess the wench.
         
         FERDINAND	Did you hear the proclamation?
         
         COSTARD	I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
         	the marking of it.
         
         FERDINAND	It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
         	with a wench.
         
         COSTARD	I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
         
         FERDINAND	Well, it was proclaimed edamsel.'
         
         COSTARD	This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.
         
         FERDINAND	It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
         
         COSTARD	If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
         
         FERDINAND	This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
         
         COSTARD	This maid will serve my turn, sir.
         
         FERDINAND	Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
         	a week with bran and water.
         
         COSTARD	I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
         
         FERDINAND	And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
         	My Lord Biron, see him delivered over:
         	And go we, lords, to put in practise that
         	Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
         
         	[Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN]
         
         BIRON	I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
         	These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
         	Sirrah, come on.
         
         COSTARD	I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
         	taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
         	girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
         	prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
         	till then, sit thee down, sorrow!

         SCENE 	The same.
         
         
         	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH]
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
         	grows melancholy?
         
         MOTH	A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
         
         MOTH	No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
         	tender juvenal?
         
         MOTH	By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Why tough senior? why tough senior?
         
         MOTH	Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
         	appertaining to thy young days, which we may
         	nominate tender.
         
         MOTH	And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
         	old time, which we may name tough.
         
         DON ADRIANO DE
         ARMADO	Pretty and apt.
         
         MOTH	How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
         	I apt, and my saying pretty?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Thou pretty, because little.
         
         MOTH	Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	And therefore apt, because quick.
         
         MOTH	Speak you this in my praise, master?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	In thy condign praise.
         
         MOTH	I will praise an eel with the same praise.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	What, that an eel is ingenious?
         
         MOTH	That an eel is quick.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
         
         MOTH	I am answered, sir.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I love not to be crossed.
         
         MOTH	[Aside]  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I have promised to study three years with the duke.
         
         MOTH	You may do it in an hour, sir.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Impossible.
         
         MOTH	How many is one thrice told?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
         
         MOTH	You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
         	complete man.
         
         MOTH	Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
         	deuce-ace amounts to.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	It doth amount to one more than two.
         
         MOTH	Which the base vulgar do call three.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	True.
         
         MOTH	Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
         	is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
         	easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
         	study three years in two words, the dancing horse
         	will tell you.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	A most fine figure!
         
         MOTH	To prove you a cipher.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
         	base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
         	base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
         	of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
         	thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
         	ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
         	courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
         	outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
         	have been in love?
         
         MOTH	Hercules, master.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
         	more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
         	repute and carriage.
         
         MOTH	Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
         	carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
         	 a porter: and he was in love.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
         	excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
         	carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
         	love, my dear Moth?
         
         MOTH	A woman, master.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Of what complexion?
         
         MOTH	Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Tell me precisely of what complexion.
         
         MOTH	Of the sea-water green, sir.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Is that one of the four complexions?
         
         MOTH	As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
         	love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
         	for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
         
         MOTH	It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	My love is most immaculate white and red.
         
         MOTH	Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
         	such colours.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Define, define, well-educated infant.
         
         MOTH	My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
         	pathetical!
         
         MOTH	     If she be made of white and red,
         	Her faults will never be known,
         	For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
         	And fears by pale white shown:
         	Then if she fear, or be to blame,
         	By this you shall not know,
         	For still her cheeks possess the same
         	Which native she doth owe.
         	A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
         	white and red.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
         
         MOTH	The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
         	three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
         	found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
         	the writing nor the tune.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will have that subject newly writ over, that I may
         	example my digression by some mighty precedent.
         	Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
         	park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
         
         MOTH	[Aside]  To be whipped; and yet a better love than
         	my master.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
         
         MOTH	And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I say, sing.
         
         MOTH	Forbear till this company be past.
         
         	[Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA]
         
         DULL	Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
         	safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
         	nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
         	For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
         	is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
         
         JAQUENETTA	Man?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will visit thee at the lodge.
         
         JAQUENETTA	That's hereby.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I know where it is situate.
         
         JAQUENETTA	Lord, how wise you are!
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will tell thee wonders.
         
         JAQUENETTA	With that face?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I love thee.
         
         JAQUENETTA	So I heard you say.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	And so, farewell.
         
         JAQUENETTA	Fair weather after you!
         
         DULL	Come, Jaquenetta, away!
         
         	[Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA]
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
         	be pardoned.
         
         COSTARD	Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
         	full stomach.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Thou shalt be heavily punished.
         
         COSTARD	I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
         	are but lightly rewarded.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Take away this villain; shut him up.
         
         MOTH	Come, you transgressing slave; away!
         
         COSTARD	Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
         
         MOTH	No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
         
         COSTARD	Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
         	that I have seen, some shall see.
         
         MOTH	What shall some see?
         
         COSTARD	Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
         	It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
         	words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
         	God I have as little patience as another man; and
         	therefore I can be quiet.
         
         	[Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD]
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
         	her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
         	is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
         	is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
         	how can that be true love which is falsely
         	attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
         	there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
         	tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
         	Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
         	Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
         	and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
         	The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
         	the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
         	not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
         	glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
         	be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
         	he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
         	for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
         	write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

         SCENE I	The same.
         
         
         	[Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA,
         	KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants]
         
         BOYET	Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
         	Consider who the king your father sends,
         	To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
         	Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
         	To parley with the sole inheritor
         	Of all perfections that a man may owe,
         	Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
         	Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
         	Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
         	As Nature was in making graces dear
         	When she did starve the general world beside
         	And prodigally gave them all to you.
         
         PRINCESS	Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
         	Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
         	Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
         	Not uttered by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
         	I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
         	Than you much willing to be counted wise
         	In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
         	But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
         	You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
         	Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
         	Till painful study shall outwear three years,
         	No woman may approach his silent court:
         	Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
         	Before we enter his forbidden gates,
         	To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
         	Bold of your worthiness, we single you
         	As our best-moving fair solicitor.
         	Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
         	On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
         	Importunes personal conference with his grace:
         	Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
         	 humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
         
         BOYET	Proud of employment, willingly I go.
         
         PRINCESS	All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
         
         	[Exit BOYET]
         
         	Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
         	That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?
         
         First Lord	Lord Longaville is one.
         
         PRINCESS	Know you the man?
         
         MARIA	I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
         	Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
         	Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
         	In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
         	A man of sovereign parts he is esteemed;
         	Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
         	Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
         	The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
         	If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
         	Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
         	Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
         	It should none spare that come within his power.
         
         PRINCESS	Some merry mocking lord, be; is't so?
         
         MARIA	They say so most that most his humours know.
         
         PRINCESS	Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
         	Who are the rest?
         
         KATHARINE	The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
         	Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
         	Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
         	For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
         	And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
         	I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
         	And much too little of that good I saw
         	Is my report to his great worthiness.
         
         ROSALINE	Another of these students at that time
         	Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
         	Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
         	Within the limit of becoming mirth,
         	I never spent an hour's talk withal:
         	His eye begets occasion for his wit;
         	For every object that the one doth catch
         	The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
         	Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
         	Delivers in such apt and gracious words
         	That aged ears play truant at his tales
         	And younger hearings are quite ravished;
         	So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
         
         PRINCESS	God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
         	That every one her own hath garnished
         	With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
         
         First Lord	Here comes Boyet.
         
         	[Re-enter BOYET]
         
         PRINCESS	Now, what admittance, lord?
         
         BOYET	Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
         	And he and his competitors in oath
         	Were all addressed to meet you, gentle lady,
         	Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
         	He rather means to lodge you in the field,
         	 one that comes here to besiege his court,
         	Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
         	To let you enter his unpeopled house.
         	Here comes Navarre.
         
         	[Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and
         	Attendants]
         
         FERDINAND	Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
         
         PRINCESS	'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
         	not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
         	yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
         
         FERDINAND	You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
         
         PRINCESS	I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.
         
         FERDINAND	Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
         
         PRINCESS	Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.
         
         FERDINAND	Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
         
         PRINCESS	Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.
         
         FERDINAND	Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
         
         PRINCESS	Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
         	Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
         	I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
         	Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
         	And sin to break it.
         	But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
         	To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
         	Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
         	And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
         
         FERDINAND	Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
         
         PRINCESS	You will the sooner, that I were away;
         	For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
         
         BIRON	Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
         
         ROSALINE	Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
         
         BIRON	I know you did.
         
         ROSALINE	How needless was it then to ask the question!
         
         BIRON	You must not be so quick.
         
         ROSALINE	'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
         
         BIRON	Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
         
         ROSALINE	Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
         
         BIRON	What time o' day?
         
         ROSALINE	The hour that fools should ask.
         
         BIRON	Now fair befall your mask!
         
         ROSALINE	Fair fall the face it covers!
         
         BIRON	And send you many lovers!
         
         ROSALINE	Amen, so you be none.
         
         BIRON	Nay, then will I be gone.
         
         FERDINAND	Madam, your father here doth intimate
         	The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
         	Being but the one half of an entire sum
         	Disbursed by my father in his wars.
         	But say that he or we, as neither have,
         	Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
         	A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
         	One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
         	Although not valued to the money's worth.
         	If then the king your father will restore
         	But that one half which is unsatisfied,
         	We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
         	And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
         	But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
         	For here he doth demand to have repaid
         	A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
         	On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
         	To have his title live in Aquitaine;
         	Which we much rather had depart withal
         	And have the money by our father lent
         	Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
         	Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
         	From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
         	A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
         	And go well satisfied to France again.
         
         PRINCESS	You do the king my father too much wrong
         	And wrong the reputation of your name,
         	In so unseeming to confess receipt
         	Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
         
         FERDINAND	I do protest I never heard of it;
         	And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
         	Or yield up Aquitaine.
         
         PRINCESS	We arrest your word.
         	Boyet, you can produce acquittances
         	For such a sum from special officers
         	Of Charles his father.
         
         FERDINAND	Satisfy me so.
         
         BOYET	So please your grace, the packet is not come
         	Where that and other specialties are bound:
         	To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
         
         FERDINAND	It shall suffice me: at which interview
         	All liberal reason I will yield unto.
         	Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
         	As honour without breach of honour may
         	Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
         	You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
         	But here without you shall be so received
         	As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
         	Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
         	Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
         	To-morrow shall we visit you again.
         
         PRINCESS	Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!
         
         FERDINAND	Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BIRON	Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
         
         ROSALINE	Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.
         
         BIRON	I would you heard it groan.
         
         ROSALINE	Is the fool sick?
         
         BIRON	Sick at the heart.
         
         ROSALINE	Alack, let it blood.
         
         BIRON	Would that do it good?
         
         ROSALINE	My physic says 'ay.'
         
         BIRON	Will you prick't with your eye?
         
         ROSALINE	No point, with my knife.
         
         BIRON	Now, God save thy life!
         
         ROSALINE	And yours from long living!
         
         BIRON	I cannot stay thanksgiving.
         
         	[Retiring]
         
         DUMAIN	Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
         
         BOYET	The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
         
         DUMAIN	A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         LONGAVILLE	I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
         
         BOYET	A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
         
         LONGAVILLE	Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
         
         BOYET	She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
         
         LONGAVILLE	Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
         
         BOYET	Her mother's, I have heard.
         
         LONGAVILLE	God's blessing on your beard!
         
         BOYET	Good sir, be not offended.
         	She is an heir of Falconbridge.
         
         LONGAVILLE	Nay, my choler is ended.
         	She is a most sweet lady.
         
         BOYET	Not un, sir, that may be.
         
         	[Exit LONGAVILLE]
         
         BIRON	What's her name in the cap?
         
         BOYET	Rosaline, by good hap.
         
         BIRON	Is she wedded or no?
         
         BOYET	To her will, sir, or so.
         
         BIRON	You are welcome, sir: adieu.
         
         BOYET	Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
         
         	[Exit BIRON]
         
         MARIA	That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
         	Not a word with him but a jest.
         
         BOYET	And every jest but a word.
         
         PRINCESS	It was well done of you to take him at his word.
         
         BOYET	I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
         
         MARIA	Two hot sheeps, marry.
         
         BOYET	And wherefore not ships?
         	No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
         
         MARIA	You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
         
         BOYET	So you grant pasture for me.
         
         	[Offering to kiss her]
         
         MARIA	Not so, gentle beast:
         	My lips are no common, though several they be.
         
         BOYET	Belonging to whom?
         
         MARIA	                  To my fortunes and me.
         
         PRINCESS	Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
         	This civil war of wits were much better used
         	On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.
         
         BOYET	If my observation, which very seldom lies,
         	By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
         	Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
         
         PRINCESS	With what?
         
         BOYET	With that which we lovers entitle affected.
         
         PRINCESS	Your reason?
         
         BOYET	Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
         	To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
         	His heart,  an agate, with your print impressed,
         	Proud with his form, in his eye pride expressed:
         	His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
         	Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
         	All senses to that sense did make their repair,
         	To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
         	Methought all his senses were locked in his eye,
         	As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
         	Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glassed,
         	Did point you to buy them, along as you passed:
         	His face's own margent did quote such amazes
         	That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
         	I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
         	An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
         
         PRINCESS	Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
         
         BOYET	But to speak that in words which his eye hath
         	disclosed.
         	I only have made a mouth of his eye,
         	By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
         
         ROSALINE	Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.
         
         MARIA	He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
         
         ROSALINE	Then was Venus  her mother, for her father is but grim.
         
         BOYET	Do you hear, my mad wenches?
         
         MARIA	No.
         
         BOYET	What then, do you see?
         
         ROSALINE	Ay, our way to be gone.
         
         BOYET	You are too hard for me.

         	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH]

         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
         
         MOTH	Concolinel.
         
         	[Singing]

         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
         	give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
         	hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.
         
         MOTH	Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	How meanest thou? brawling in French?
         
         MOTH	No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
         	the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
         	it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
         	sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
         	swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
         	the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
         	love; with your hat penthouse- over the shop of
         	your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
         	doublet  a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
         	your pocket  a man after the old painting; and
         	keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
         	These are complements, these are humours; these
         	betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
         	these; and make them men of note--do you note
         	me?--that most are affected to these.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	How hast thou purchased this experience?
         
         MOTH	By my penny of observation.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	But O,--but O,--
         
         MOTH	'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
         
         MOTH	No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
         	love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Almost I had.
         
         MOTH	Negligent student! learn her by heart.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By heart and in heart, boy.
         
         MOTH	And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	What wilt thou prove?
         
         MOTH	A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
         	the instant: by heart you love her, because your
         	heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
         	because your heart is in love with her; and out of
         	heart you love her, being out of heart that you
         	cannot enjoy her.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I am all these three.
         
         MOTH	And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
         	all.

         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
         
         MOTH	A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
         	for an ass.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
         
         MOTH	Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
         	for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The way is but short: away!
         
         MOTH	As swift as lead, sir.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The meaning, pretty ingenious?
         	Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
         
         MOTH	Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I say lead is slow.
         
         MOTH	You are too swift, sir, to say so:
         	Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
         	He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
         	I shoot thee at the swain.
         
         MOTH	Thump then and I flee.

         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!

         	Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.

         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.
         
         COSTARD	No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
         	mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
         	l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
         	thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
         	me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
         	Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
         	the word l'envoy for a salve?
         
         MOTH	Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
         	Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
         	I will example it:
         	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
         	Were still at odds, being but three.
         	There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.
         
         MOTH	I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	          The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
         	Were still at odds, being but three.
         
         MOTH	          Until the goose came out of door,
         	And stayed the odds by adding four.
         	Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
         	my l'envoy.
         	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
         	Were still at odds, being but three.
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	          Until the goose came out of door,
         	Staying the odds by adding four.
         
         MOTH	A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
         	desire more?
         
         COSTARD	The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
         	Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
         	To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
         	Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
         
         MOTH	By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
         	Then called you for the l'envoy.
         
         COSTARD	True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
         	argument in;
         	Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
         	And he ended the market.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
         
         MOTH	I will tell you sensibly.
         
         COSTARD	Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
         	I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
         	Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	We will talk no more of this matter.
         
         COSTARD	Till there be more matter in the shin.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.
         
         COSTARD	O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
         	some goose, in this.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
         	enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
         	restrained, captivated, bound.
         
         COSTARD	True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
         	in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:

         	[Exit MOTH]
         
         	Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
         	O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
         	farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
         	inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
         	remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
         	why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
         	never buy and sell out of this word.
         
         	[Enter BIRON]
         
         BIRON	O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.
         
         COSTARD	Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
         	buy for a remuneration?
         
         BIRON	What is a remuneration?
         
         COSTARD	Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
         
         BIRON	Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
         
         COSTARD	I thank your worship: God be wi' you!
         
         BIRON	Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
         	As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
         	Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
         
         COSTARD	When would you have it done, sir?
         
         BIRON	This afternoon.
         
         COSTARD	Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.
         
         BIRON	Thou knowest not what it is.
         
         COSTARD	I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
         
         BIRON	Why, villain, thou must know first.
         
         COSTARD	I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
         
         BIRON	It must be done this afternoon.
         	Hark, slave, it is but this:
         	The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
         	And in her train there is a gentle lady;
         	When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
         	And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
         	And to her white hand see thou do commend
         	This sealed-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
         
         	[Giving him a shilling]
         
         COSTARD	Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
         	a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
         	will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!

         	A domineering pedant over the boy;

         	Sole imperator and great general
         	Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
         	And I to be a corporal of his field,
         	And wear his colours  a tumbler's hoop!
         	What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
         	A woman, that is  a German clock,
         	Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
         	And never going aright, being a watch,
         	But being watched that it may still go right!
         	Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
         	And, among three, to love the worst of all;
         	A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
         	With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
         	Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
         	Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:

         SCENE I	The same.
         
         
         	[Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester,
         	BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE]
         
         PRINCESS	Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
         	Against the steep uprising of the hill?
         
         BOYET	I know not; but I think it was not he.
         
         PRINCESS	Whoever a' was, a' showed a mounting mind.
         	Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
         	On Saturday we will return to France.
         	Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
         	That we must stand and play the murderer in?
         
         Forester	Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
         	A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
         
         PRINCESS	I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
         	And thereupon thou speakest the fairest shoot.
         
         Forester	Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.
         
         PRINCESS	What, what? first praise me and again say no?
         	O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!
         
         Forester	Yes, madam, fair.
         
         PRINCESS	                  Nay, never paint me now:
         	Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
         	Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
         	Fair payment for foul words is more than due.
         
         Forester	Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
         
         PRINCESS	See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
         	O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
         	A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
         	But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
         	And shooting well is then accounted ill.
         	Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
         	Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
         	If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
         	That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
         	And out of question so it is sometimes,
         	Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
         	When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
         	We bend to that the working of the heart;
         	As I for praise alone now seek to spill
         	The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.
         
         BOYET	Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
         	Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
         	Lords over their lords?
         
         PRINCESS	Only for praise: and praise we may afford
         	To any lady that subdues a lord.
         
         BOYET	Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
         
         	[Enter COSTARD]
         
         COSTARD	God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
         
         PRINCESS	Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.
         
         COSTARD	Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
         
         PRINCESS	The thickest and the tallest.
         
         COSTARD	The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
         	An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
         	One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
         	Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.
         
         PRINCESS	What's your will, sir? what's your will?
         
         COSTARD	I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.
         
         PRINCESS	O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
         	Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
         	Break up this capon.
         
         BOYET	I am bound to serve.
         	This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
         	It is writ to Jaquenetta.
         
         PRINCESS	We will read it, I swear.
         	Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         BOYET	'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
         	true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
         	thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
         	than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
         	commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
         	magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
         	eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
         	Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
         	Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
         	vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
         	came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
         	overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
         	come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
         	whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
         	beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
         	conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
         	The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
         	beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
         	side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
         	both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
         	thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
         	Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
         	thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
         	will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
         	for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
         	expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
         	my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
         	part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
         		    DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
         
         	Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
         	'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
         	Submissive fall his princely feet before,
         	And he from forage will incline to play:
         	But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
         	Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
         
         PRINCESS	What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
         	What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?
         
         BOYET	I am much deceived but I remember the style.
         
         PRINCESS	Else your memory is bad, going over it erewhile.
         
         BOYET	This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
         	A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
         	To the prince and his bookmates.
         
         PRINCESS	Thou fellow, a word:
         	Who gave thee this letter?
         
         COSTARD	I told you; my lord.
         
         PRINCESS	To whom shouldst thou give it?
         
         COSTARD	From my lord to my lady.
         
         PRINCESS	From which lord to which lady?
         
         COSTARD	From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
         	To a lady of France that he called Rosaline.
         
         PRINCESS	Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
         
         	[To ROSALINE]
         
         	Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.

         BOYET	Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?
         
         ROSALINE	Shall I teach you to know?
         
         BOYET	Ay, my continent of beauty.
         
         ROSALINE	Why, she that bears the bow.
         	Finely put off!
         
         BOYET	My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
         	Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
         	Finely put on!
         
         ROSALINE	Well, then, I am the shooter.
         
         BOYET	And who is your deer?
         
         ROSALINE	If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
         	Finely put on, indeed!
         
         MARIA	You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
         	at the brow.

         	wench, as touching the hit it.
         
         ROSALINE	          Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
         	Thou canst not hit it, my good man.

         BOYET	A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
         	Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.
         
         MARIA	Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.

         COSTARD	She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.

         	vulgar wit!
         	When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
         	were, so fit.
         	Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
         	To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
         	To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'

         SCENE 	The same.
         
         
         	[Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL]
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
         	of a good conscience.
         
         HOLOFERNES	The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
         	as the pomewater, who now hangeth  a jewel in
         	the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
         	and anon falleth  a crab on the face of terra,
         	the soil, the land, the earth.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
         	varied,  a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
         	assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
         
         DULL	'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
         	insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
         	explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
         	rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
         	inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
         	uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
         	unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
         	insert again my haud credo for a deer.
         
         DULL	I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
         	O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
         	in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
         	hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
         	replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
         	the duller parts:
         	And such barren plants are set before us, that we
         	thankful should be,
         	Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
         	do fructify in us more than he.
         	For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
         	So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
         	But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,
         	Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.
         
         DULL	You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
         	What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
         	weeks old as yet?
         
         HOLOFERNES	Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
         
         DULL	What is Dictynna?
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
         
         HOLOFERNES	The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
         	And raught not to five weeks when he came to
         	five-score.
         	The allusion holds in the exchange.
         
         DULL	'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
         
         HOLOFERNES	God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
         	in the exchange.
         
         DULL	And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
         	the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
         	that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
         	on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
         	ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall
         	please you to abrogate scurrility.
         
         HOLOFERNES	I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
         	The preyful princess pierced and pricked a pretty
         	pleasing pricket;
         	Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
         	sore with shooting.
         	The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
         	from thicket;
         	Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
         	If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
         	one sorel.
         	Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	A rare talent!
         
         DULL	[Aside]  If a talent be a claw, look how he claws
         	him with a talent.
         
         HOLOFERNES	This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a
         	foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
         	shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
         	revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
         	memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
         	delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
         	gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
         	thankful for it.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my
         	parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by
         	you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
         	you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
         	want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,
         	I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
         	loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.
         
         	[Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD]
         
         JAQUENETTA	God give you good morrow, master Parson.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
         	pierced, which is the one?
         
         COSTARD	Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is  to a hogshead.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
         	tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
         	for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.
         
         JAQUENETTA	Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
         	letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
         	from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
         	Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
         	may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;
         	Venetia, Venetia,
         	Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
         	Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
         	not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
         	Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
         	as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	Ay, sir, and very learned.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	[Reads]
         
         	If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
         	Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed!
         	Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:
         	Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee 
         	osiers bowed.
         	Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
         	Where all those pleasures live that art would
         	comprehend:
         	If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
         	Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
         	All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
         	Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
         	Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
         	Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
         	Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
         	That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.
         
         HOLOFERNES	You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
         	accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
         	only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,
         	facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
         	Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
         	but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
         	fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:
         	so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
         	the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
         	was this directed to you?
         
         JAQUENETTA	Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
         	queen's lords.
         
         HOLOFERNES	I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
         	snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
         	Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
         	the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
         	to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
         	desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
         	Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here
         	he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
         	queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
         	progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
         	sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
         	king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
         	compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.
         
         JAQUENETTA	Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
         
         COSTARD	Have with thee, my girl.

         	religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--
         
         HOLOFERNES	Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable
         	colours. But to return to the verses: did they
         	please you, Sir Nathaniel?
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	Marvellous well for the pen.
         
         HOLOFERNES	I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
         	of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please

         	beseech your society.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is
         	the happiness of life.

         	love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
         	in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
         	heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
         	and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,

         	sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent

         	So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.

         BIRON	An amber-coloured raven was well noted.
         
         DUMAIN	As upright as the cedar.
         
         BIRON	Stoop, I say;
         	Her shoulder is with child.
         
         DUMAIN	As fair as day.
         
         BIRON	Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.
         
         DUMAIN	O that I had my wish!
         
         LONGAVILLE	And I had mine!
         
         FERDINAND	And I mine too, good Lord!
         
         BIRON	Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?
         
         DUMAIN	I would forget her; but a fever she
         	Reigns in my blood and will remembered be.
         
         BIRON	A fever in your blood! why, then incision
         	Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!
         
         DUMAIN	Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
         
         BIRON	Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.
         
         DUMAIN	[Reads]
         
         	On a day--alack the day!--
         	Love, whose month is ever May,
         	Spied a blossom passing fair
         	Playing in the wanton air:
         	Through the velvet leaves the wind,
         	All unseen, can passage find;
         	That the lover, sick to death,
         	Wish himself the heaven's breath.
         	Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
         	Air, would I might triumph so!
         	But, alack, my hand is sworn
         	never to pluck thee from thy thorn;
         	Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
         	Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
         	Do not call it sin in me,
         	That I am forsworn for thee;
         	Thou for whom Jove would swear
         	Juno but an Ethiope were;
         	And deny himself for Jove,
         	Turning mortal for thy love.
         	This will I send, and something else more plain,
         	That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
         	O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
         	Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
         	Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
         	For none offend where all a do dote.
         
         LONGAVILLE	[Advancing]  Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
         	You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
         	To be overheard and taken napping so.
         
         FERDINAND	[Advancing]  Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
         	You chide at him, offending twice as much;
         	You do not love Maria; Longaville
         	Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
         	Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
         	His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
         	I have been closely shrouded in this bush
         	And marked you both and for you both did blush:
         	I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
         	Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
         	Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
         	One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:
         
         	[To LONGAVILLE]
         
         	You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
         
         	[To DUMAIN]
         
         	And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
         	What will Biron say when that he shall hear
         	Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
         	How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
         	How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
         	For all the wealth that ever I did see,
         	I would not have him know so much by me.
         
         BIRON	Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
         
         	[Advancing]
         
         	Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
         	Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
         	These worms for loving, that art most in love?
         	Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
         	There is no certain princess that appears;
         	You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
         	Tush, none but minstrels  of sonneting!
         	But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
         	All three of you, to be thus much overshot?
         	You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
         	But I a beam do find in each of three.
         	O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
         	Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
         	O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
         	To see a king transformed to a gnat!
         	To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
         	And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
         	And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
         	And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
         	Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
         	And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
         	And where my liege's? all about the breast:
         	A caudle, ho!
         
         FERDINAND	                  Too bitter is thy jest.
         	Are we betrayed thus to thy over-view?
         
         BIRON	Not you to me, but I betrayed by you:
         	I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
         	To break the vow I am engaged in;
         	I am betrayed, by keeping company
         	With men  men of inconstancy.
         	When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
         	Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
         	In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
         	Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
         	A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
         	A leg, a limb?
         
         FERDINAND	                  Soft! whither away so fast?
         	A true man or a thief that gallops so?
         
         BIRON	I post from love: good lover, let me go.
         
         	[Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD]
         
         JAQUENETTA	God bless the king!
         
         FERDINAND	What present hast thou there?
         
         COSTARD	Some certain treason.
         
         FERDINAND	What makes treason here?
         
         COSTARD	Nay, it makes nothing, sir.
         
         FERDINAND	If it mar nothing neither,
         	The treason and you go in peace away together.
         
         JAQUENETTA	I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
         	Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.
         
         FERDINAND	Biron, read it over.
         
         	[Giving him the paper]
         
         	Where hadst thou it?
         
         JAQUENETTA	Of Costard.
         
         FERDINAND	Where hadst thou it?
         
         COSTARD	Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
         
         	[BIRON tears the letter]
         
         FERDINAND	How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?
         
         BIRON	A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.
         
         LONGAVILLE	It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.
         
         DUMAIN	It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
         
         	[Gathering up the pieces]
         
         BIRON	[To COSTARD]  Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
         	born to do me shame.
         	Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.
         
         FERDINAND	What?
         
         BIRON	That you three fools lacked me fool to make up the mess:
         	He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
         	Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
         	O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.
         
         DUMAIN	Now the number is even.
         
         BIRON	True, true; we are four.
         	Will these turtles be gone?
         
         FERDINAND	Hence, sirs; away!
         
         COSTARD	Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.
         
         	[Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA]
         
         BIRON	Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
         	As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
         	The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
         	Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
         	We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
         	Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.
         
         FERDINAND	What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
         
         BIRON	Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
         	That,  a rude and savage man of Inde,
         	At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
         	Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
         	Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
         	What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
         	Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
         	That is not blinded by her majesty?
         
         FERDINAND	   What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
         	My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
         	She an attending star, scarce seen a light.
         
         BIRON	My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
         	O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
         	Of all complexions the culled sovereignty
         	Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
         	Where several worthies make one dignity,
         	Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
         	Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
         	Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
         	To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
         	She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
         	A withered hermit, five-score winters worn,
         	Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
         	Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
         	And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
         	O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.
         
         FERDINAND	   By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
         
         BIRON	Is ebony  her? O wood divine!
         	A wife of such wood were felicity.
         	O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
         	That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
         	If that she learn not of her eye to look:
         	No face is fair that is not full so black.
         
         FERDINAND	O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
         	The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
         	And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
         
         BIRON	   Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
         	O, if in black my lady's brows be decked,
         	It mourns that painting and usurping hair
         	Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
         	And therefore is she born to make black fair.
         	Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
         	For native blood is counted painting now;
         	And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
         	Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
         
         DUMAIN	To look  her are chimney-sweepers black.
         
         LONGAVILLE	   And since her time are colliers counted bright.
         
         FERDINAND	And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
         
         DUMAIN	   Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
         
         BIRON	Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
         	For fear their colours should be washed away.
         
         FERDINAND	'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
         	I'll find a fairer face not washed to-day.
         
         BIRON	I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.
         
         FERDINAND	   No devil will fright thee then so much as she.
         
         DUMAIN	I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
         
         LONGAVILLE	   Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
         
         BIRON	O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
         	Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
         
         DUMAIN	O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
         	The street should see as she walked overhead.
         
         FERDINAND	But what of this? are we not all in love?
         
         BIRON	   Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
         
         FERDINAND	Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
         	Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.
         
         DUMAIN	Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.
         
         LONGAVILLE	   O, some authority how to proceed;
         	Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.
         
         DUMAIN	Some salve for perjury.
         
         BIRON	'Tis more than need.
         	Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
         	Consider what you first did swear unto,
         	To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
         	Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
         	Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
         	And abstinence engenders maladies.
         	And where that you have vowed to study, lords,
         	In that each of you have forsworn his book,
         	Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
         	For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
         	Have found the ground of study's excellence
         	Without the beauty of a woman's face?
         	[From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;
         	They are the ground, the books, the academes
         	From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire]
         	Why, universal plodding poisons up
         	The nimble spirits in the arteries,
         	As motion and long-during action tires
         	The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
         	Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
         	You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
         	And study too, the causer of your vow;
         	For where is any author in the world
         	Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
         	Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
         	And where we are our learning wise is:
         	Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
         	Do we not wise see our learning there?
         	O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
         	And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
         	For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
         	In leaden contemplation have found out
         	Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
         	Of beauty's tutors have enriched you with?
         	Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
         	And therefore, finding barren practisers,
         	Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
         	But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
         	Lives not alone immured in the brain;
         	But, with the motion of all elements,
         	Courses as swift as thought in every power,
         	And gives to every power a double power,
         	Above their functions and their offices.
         	It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
         	A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
         	A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
         	When the suspicious head of theft is stopped:
         	Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
         	Than are the tender horns of cockled snails;
         	Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
         	For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
         	Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
         	Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
         	As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
         	And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
         	Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
         	Never durst poet touch a pen to write
         	Until his ink were tempered with Love's sighs;
         	O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
         	And plant in tyrants mild humility.
         	From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
         	They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
         	They are the books, the arts, the academes,
         	That show, contain and nourish all the world:
         	Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
         	Then fools you were these women to forswear,
         	Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
         	For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
         	Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
         	Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
         	Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
         	Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
         	Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
         	It is religion to be thus forsworn,
         	For charity itself fulfills the law,
         	And who can sever love from charity?
         
         FERDINAND	Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
         
         BIRON	Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
         	Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
         	In conflict that you get the sun of them.
         
         LONGAVILLE	Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
         	Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
         
         FERDINAND	And win them too: therefore let us devise
         	Some entertainment for them in their tents.
         
         BIRON	First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
         	Then homeward every man attach the hand
         	Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
         	We will with some strange pastime solace them,
         	Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
         	For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
         	Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.
         
         FERDINAND	Away, away! no time shall be omitted
         	That will betime, and may by us be fitted.
         
         BIRON	Allons! allons! Sowed cockle reaped no corn;
         	And justice always whirls in equal measure:

         SCENE I	The same.
         
         
         	[Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL]
         
         HOLOFERNES	Satis quod sufficit.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
         	have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
         	scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
         	impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
         	out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
         	a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
         	nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
         	discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
         	ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
         	behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
         	too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
         	were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	A most singular and choice epithet.
         
         	[Draws out his table-book]
         
         HOLOFERNES	He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
         	than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
         	fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
         	point-devise companions; such rackers of
         	orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
         	say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
         	e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
         	half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
         	abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
         	would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
         	insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	Laus Deo, bene intelligo.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratched,
         	'twill serve.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	Videsne quis venit?
         
         HOLOFERNES	Video, et gaudeo.

         	[To MOTH]

         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Men of peace, well encountered.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Most military sir, salutation.
         
         MOTH	[Aside to COSTARD]  They have been at a great feast
         	of languages, and stolen the scraps.
         
         COSTARD	O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
         	I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
         	for thou art not so long by the head as
         	honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
         	swallowed than a flap-dragon.
         
         MOTH	Peace! the peal begins.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	[To HOLOFERNES]  Monsieur, are you not lettered?
         
         MOTH	Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
         	b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?
         
         HOLOFERNES	Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
         
         MOTH	Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Quis, quis, thou consonant?
         
         MOTH	The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
         	the fifth, if I.
         
         HOLOFERNES	I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--
         
         MOTH	The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
         	touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
         	home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!
         
         MOTH	Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.
         
         HOLOFERNES	What is the figure? what is the figure?
         
         MOTH	Horns.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Thou disputest  an infant: go, whip thy gig.
         
         MOTH	Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
         	your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.
         
         COSTARD	An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
         	have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
         	remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
         	purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
         	the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
         	bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
         	Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
         	ends, as they say.
         
         HOLOFERNES	O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
         	barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
         	charge-house on the top of the mountain?
         
         HOLOFERNES	Or mons, the hill.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
         
         HOLOFERNES	I do, sans question.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
         	affection to congratulate the princess at her
         	pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
         	rude multitude call the afternoon.
         
         HOLOFERNES	The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
         	liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
         	the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
         	assure you, sir, I do assure.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
         	I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
         	inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
         	remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
         	head: and among other important and most serious
         	designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
         	that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
         	grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
         	shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
         	with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
         	heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
         	fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
         	greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
         	travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
         	The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
         	implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
         	present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
         	delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
         	antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
         	curate and your sweet self are good at such
         	eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
         	were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
         	crave your assistance.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
         	Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
         	show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
         	our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
         	gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
         	the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
         	Nine Worthies.
         
         SIR NATHANIEL	Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
         
         HOLOFERNES	Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
         	Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
         	limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
         	page, Hercules,--
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
         	that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
         	minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
         	snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.
         
         MOTH	An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
         	hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
         	crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
         	offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	For the rest of the Worthies?--
         
         HOLOFERNES	I will play three myself.
         
         MOTH	Thrice-worthy gentleman!
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Shall I tell you a thing?
         
         HOLOFERNES	We attend.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
         	beseech you, follow.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.
         
         DULL	Nor understood none neither, sir.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Allons! we will employ thee.
         
         DULL	I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
         	On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.
         
         HOLOFERNES	Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!

         	[Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA]
         
         PRINCESS	Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
         	If fairings come thus plentifully in:
         	A lady walled about with diamonds!
         	Look you what I have from the loving king.
         
         ROSALINE	Madame, came nothing else along with that?
         
         PRINCESS	Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
         	As would be crammed up in a sheet of paper,
         	Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
         	That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.
         
         ROSALINE	That was the way to make his godhead wax,
         	For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
         
         KATHARINE	Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
         
         ROSALINE	You'll never be friends with him; a' killed your sister.
         
         KATHARINE	He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
         	And so she died: had she been light,  you,
         	Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
         	She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
         	And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
         
         ROSALINE	What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
         
         KATHARINE	A light condition in a beauty dark.
         
         ROSALINE	We need more light to find your meaning out.
         
         KATHARINE	You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
         	Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
         
         ROSALINE	Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.
         
         KATHARINE	So do not you, for you are a light wench.
         
         ROSALINE	Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.
         
         KATHARINE	You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
         
         ROSALINE	Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
         
         PRINCESS	Well bandied both; a set of wit well played.
         	But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
         	Who sent it? and what is it?
         
         ROSALINE	I would you knew:
         	An if my face were but as fair as yours,
         	My favour were as great; be witness this.
         	Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
         	The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
         	I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
         	I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
         	O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!
         
         PRINCESS	Any thing ?
         
         ROSALINE	Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
         
         PRINCESS	Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
         
         KATHARINE	Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
         
         ROSALINE	'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
         	My red dominical, my golden letter:
         	O, that your face were not so full of O's!
         
         KATHARINE	A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
         
         PRINCESS	But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?
         
         KATHARINE	Madam, this glove.
         
         PRINCESS	                  Did he not send you twain?
         
         KATHARINE	Yes, madam, and moreover
         	Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
         	A huge translation of hypocrisy,
         	Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.
         
         MARIA	This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
         	The letter is too long by half a mile.
         
         PRINCESS	I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
         	The chain were longer and the letter short?
         
         MARIA	Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
         
         PRINCESS	We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
         
         ROSALINE	They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
         	That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
         	O that I knew he were but in by the week!
         	How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
         	And wait the season and observe the times
         	And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
         	And shape his service wholly to my hests
         	And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
         	So perttaunt- would I oversway his state
         	That he should be my fool and I his fate.
         
         PRINCESS	None are so surely caught, when they are catched,
         	As wit turned fool: folly, in wisdom hatched,
         	Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
         	And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
         
         ROSALINE	The blood of youth burns not with such excess
         	As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
         
         MARIA	Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
         	As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
         	Since all the power thereof it doth apply
         	To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
         
         PRINCESS	Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
         
         	[Enter BOYET]
         
         BOYET	O, I am stabbed with laughter! Where's her grace?
         
         PRINCESS	Thy news Boyet?
         
         BOYET	                  Prepare, madam, prepare!
         	Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
         	Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
         	Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
         	Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
         	Or hide your heads  cowards, and fly hence.
         
         PRINCESS	Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
         	That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.
         
         BOYET	Under the cool shade of a sycamore
         	I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
         	When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
         	Toward that shade I might behold addrest
         	The king and his companions: warily
         	I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
         	And overheard what you shall overhear,
         	That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
         	Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
         	That well by heart hath conned his embassage:
         	Action and accent did they teach him there;
         	'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
         	And ever and anon they made a doubt
         	Presence majestical would put him out,
         	'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
         	Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
         	The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
         	I should have feared her had she been a devil.'
         	With that, all laughed and clapped him on the shoulder,
         	Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
         	One rubbed his elbow thus, and fleered and swore
         	A better speech was never spoke before;
         	Another, with his finger and his thumb,
         	Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
         	The third he capered, and cried, 'All goes well;'
         	The fourth turned on the toe, and down he fell.
         	With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
         	With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
         	That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
         	To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.
         
         PRINCESS	But what, but what, come they to visit us?
         
         BOYET	They do, they do: and are apparelled thus.
         	 Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
         	Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
         	And every one his love-feat will advance
         	Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
         	By favours several which they did bestow.
         
         PRINCESS	And will they so? the gallants shall be tasked;
         	For, ladies, we shall every one be masked;
         	And not a man of them shall have the grace,
         	Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
         	Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
         	And then the king will court thee for his dear;
         	Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
         	So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
         	And change your favours too; so shall your loves
         	Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.
         
         ROSALINE	Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.
         
         KATHARINE	But in this changing what is your intent?
         
         PRINCESS	The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
         	They do it but in mocking merriment;
         	And mock for mock is only my intent.
         	Their several counsels they unbosom shall
         	To loves mistook, and so be mocked withal
         	Upon the next occasion that we meet,
         	With visages displayed, to talk and greet.
         
         ROSALINE	But shall we dance, if they desire to't?
         
         PRINCESS	No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
         	Nor to their penned speech render we no grace,
         	But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
         
         BOYET	Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
         	And quite divorce his memory from his part.
         
         PRINCESS	Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
         	The rest will never come in, if he be out
         	There's no such sport as sport by sport overthrown,
         	To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
         	So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
         	And they, well mocked, depart away with shame.
         
         	[Trumpets sound within]
         
         BOYET	The trumpet sounds: be masked; the maskers come.
         
         	[The Ladies mask]
         
         	[Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND,
         	BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits,
         	and masked]
         
         MOTH	All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--
         
         BOYET	Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
         
         MOTH	A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
         
         	[The Ladies turn their backs to him]
         
         	That ever turned their--backs--to mortal views!
         
         BIRON	[Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!
         
         MOTH	That ever turned their eyes to mortal views!--Out--
         
         BOYET	True; out indeed.
         
         MOTH	Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
         	Not to behold--
         
         BIRON	[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue.
         
         MOTH	Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
         	--with your sun-beamed eyes--
         
         BOYET	They will not answer to that epithet;
         	You were best call it edaughter-beamed eyes.'
         
         MOTH	They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
         
         BIRON	Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!
         
         	[Exit MOTH]
         
         ROSALINE	What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
         	If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:
         	That some plain man recount their purposes
         	Know what they would.
         
         BOYET	What would you with the princess?
         
         BIRON	Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
         
         ROSALINE	What would they, say they?
         
         BOYET	Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
         
         ROSALINE	Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
         
         BOYET	She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
         
         FERDINAND	Say to her, we have measured many miles
         	To tread a measure with her on this grass.
         
         BOYET	They say, that they have measured many a mile
         	To tread a measure with you on this grass.
         
         ROSALINE	It is not so. Ask them how many inches
         	Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
         	The measure then of one is easily told.
         
         BOYET	If to come hither you have measured miles,
         	And many miles, the princess bids you tell
         	How many inches doth fill up one mile.
         
         BIRON	Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.
         
         BOYET	She hears herself.
         
         ROSALINE	                  How many weary steps,
         	Of many weary miles you have overgone,
         	Are numbered in the travel of one mile?
         
         BIRON	We number nothing that we spend for you:
         	Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
         	That we may do it still without accompt.
         	Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
         	That we,  savages, may worship it.
         
         ROSALINE	My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
         
         FERDINAND	Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
         	Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
         	Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.
         
         ROSALINE	O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
         	Thou now requestest but moonshine in the water.
         
         FERDINAND	Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
         	Thou bidest me beg: this begging is not strange.
         
         ROSALINE	Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
         
         	[Music plays]
         
         	Not yet! no dance! Thus change I  the moon.
         
         FERDINAND	Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
         
         ROSALINE	You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
         
         FERDINAND	Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
         	The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.
         
         ROSALINE	Our ears vouchsafe it.
         
         FERDINAND	But your legs should do it.
         
         ROSALINE	Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
         	We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.
         
         FERDINAND	Why take we hands, then?
         
         ROSALINE	Only to part friends:
         	Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.
         
         FERDINAND	More measure of this measure; be not nice.
         
         ROSALINE	We can afford no more at such a price.
         
         FERDINAND	Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
         
         ROSALINE	Your absence only.
         
         FERDINAND	                  That can never be.
         
         ROSALINE	Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
         	Twice to your visor, and half once to you.
         
         FERDINAND	If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
         
         ROSALINE	In private, then.
         
         FERDINAND	                  I am best pleased with that.
         
         	[They converse apart]
         
         BIRON	White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
         
         PRINCESS	Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
         
         BIRON	Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
         	Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
         	There's half-a-dozen sweets.
         
         PRINCESS	Seventh sweet, adieu:
         	Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.
         
         BIRON	One word in secret.
         
         PRINCESS	Let it not be sweet.
         
         BIRON	Thou grievest my gall.
         
         PRINCESS	Gall! bitter.
         
         BIRON	Therefore meet.
         
         	[They converse apart]
         
         DUMAIN	Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
         
         MARIA	Name it.
         
         DUMAIN	       Fair lady,--
         
         MARIA	Say you so? Fair lord,--
         	Take that for your fair lady.
         
         DUMAIN	Please it you,
         	As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
         
         	[They converse apart]
         
         KATHARINE	What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
         
         LONGAVILLE	I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
         
         KATHARINE	O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.
         
         LONGAVILLE	You have a double tongue within your mask,
         	And would afford my speechless vizard half.
         
         KATHARINE	Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
         
         LONGAVILLE	A calf, fair lady!
         
         KATHARINE	                  No, a fair lord calf.
         
         LONGAVILLE	Let's part the word.
         
         KATHARINE	No, I'll not be your half
         	Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
         
         LONGAVILLE	Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
         	Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.
         
         KATHARINE	Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
         
         LONGAVILLE	One word in private with you, ere I die.
         
         KATHARINE	Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
         
         	[They converse apart]
         
         BOYET	The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
         	As is the razor's edge invisible,
         	Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
         	Above the sense of sense; so sensible
         	Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
         	Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.
         
         ROSALINE	Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
         
         BIRON	By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
         
         FERDINAND	Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
         
         PRINCESS	Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
         
         	[Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors]
         
         	Are these the breed of wits so wondered at?
         
         BOYET	Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puffed out.
         
         ROSALINE	Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
         
         PRINCESS	O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
         	Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
         	Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
         	This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.
         
         ROSALINE	O, they were all in lamentable cases!
         	The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
         
         PRINCESS	Biron did swear himself out of all suit.
         
         MARIA	Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
         	No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
         
         KATHARINE	Lord Longaville said, I came over his heart;
         	And trow you what he called me?
         
         PRINCESS	Qualm, perhaps.
         
         KATHARINE	Yes, in good faith.
         
         PRINCESS	Go, sickness as thou art!
         
         ROSALINE	Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
         	But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.
         
         PRINCESS	And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.
         
         KATHARINE	And Longaville was for my service born.
         
         MARIA	Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
         
         BOYET	Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
         	Immediately they will again be here
         	In their own shapes; for it can never be
         	They will digest this harsh indignity.
         
         PRINCESS	Will they return?
         
         BOYET	                  They will, they will, God knows,
         	And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
         	Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
         	Blow  sweet roses in this summer air.
         
         PRINCESS	How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
         
         BOYET	Fair ladies masked are roses in their bud;
         	Dismasked, their damask sweet commixture shown,
         	Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.
         
         PRINCESS	Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
         	If they return in their own shapes to woo?
         
         ROSALINE	Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
         	Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
         	Let us complain to them what fools were here,
         	Disguised  Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
         	And wonder what they were and to what end
         	Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penned
         	And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
         	Should be presented at our tent to us.
         
         BOYET	Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
         
         PRINCESS	Whip to our tents, as roes run over land.
         
         	[Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA]
         
         	[Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN,
         	in their proper habits]
         
         FERDINAND	Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?
         
         BOYET	Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
         	Command me any service to her thither?
         
         FERDINAND	That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
         
         BOYET	I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BIRON	This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
         	And utters it again when God doth please:
         	He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
         	At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
         	And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
         	Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
         	This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
         	Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
         	A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
         	That kissed his hand away in courtesy;
         	This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
         	That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
         	In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
         	A mean most meanly; and in ushering
         	Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
         	The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
         	This is the flower that smiles on every one,
         	To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
         	And consciences, that will not die in debt,
         	Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.
         
         FERDINAND	A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
         	That put Armado's page out of his part!
         
         BIRON	See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
         	Till this madman showed thee? and what art thou now?
         
         	[Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE,
         	MARIA, and KATHARINE]
         
         FERDINAND	All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
         
         PRINCESS	'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
         
         FERDINAND	Construe my speeches better, if you may.
         
         PRINCESS	Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
         
         FERDINAND	We came to visit you, and purpose now
         	To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.
         
         PRINCESS	This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
         	Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
         
         FERDINAND	Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
         	The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
         
         PRINCESS	You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
         	For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
         	Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
         	As the unsullied lily, I protest,
         	A world of torments though I should endure,
         	I would not yield to be your house's guest;
         	So much I hate a breaking cause to be
         	Of heavenly oaths, vowed with integrity.
         
         FERDINAND	O, you have lived in desolation here,
         	Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
         
         PRINCESS	Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
         	We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
         	A mess of Russians left us but of late.
         
         FERDINAND	How, madam! Russians!
         
         PRINCESS	Ay, in truth, my lord;
         	Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.
         
         ROSALINE	Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
         	My lady, to the manner of the days,
         	In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
         	We four indeed confronted were with four
         	In Russian habit: here they stayed an hour,
         	And talked apace; and in that hour, my lord,
         	They did not bless us with one happy word.
         	I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
         	When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
         
         BIRON	This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
         	Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
         	With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
         	By light we lose light: your capacity
         	Is of that nature that to your huge store
         	Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
         
         ROSALINE	This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--
         
         BIRON	I am a fool, and full of poverty.
         
         ROSALINE	But that you take what doth to you belong,
         	It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
         
         BIRON	O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
         
         ROSALINE	All the fool mine?
         
         BIRON	                  I cannot give you less.
         
         ROSALINE	Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
         
         BIRON	Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?
         
         ROSALINE	There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
         	That hid the worse and showed the better face.
         
         FERDINAND	We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.
         
         DUMAIN	Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
         
         PRINCESS	Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
         
         ROSALINE	Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
         	Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.
         
         BIRON	Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
         	Can any face of brass hold longer out?
         	Here stand I	lady, dart thy skill at me;
         	Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
         	Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
         	Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
         	And I will wish thee never more to dance,
         	Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
         	O, never will I trust to speeches penned,
         	Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
         	Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
         	Nor woo in rhyme,  a blind harper's song!
         	Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
         	Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
         	Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
         	Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
         	I do forswear them; and I here protest,
         	By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
         	Henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed
         	In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
         	And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
         	My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
         
         ROSALINE	Sans sans, I pray you.
         
         BIRON	Yet I have a trick
         	Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
         	I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
         	Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
         	They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
         	They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
         	These lords are visited; you are not free,
         	For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
         
         PRINCESS	No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
         
         BIRON	Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.
         
         ROSALINE	It is not so; for how can this be true,
         	That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?
         
         BIRON	Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
         
         ROSALINE	Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
         
         BIRON	Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
         
         FERDINAND	Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
         	Some fair excuse.
         
         PRINCESS	                  The fairest is confession.
         	Were not you here but even now disguised?
         
         FERDINAND	Madam, I was.
         
         PRINCESS	                  And were you well advised?
         
         FERDINAND	I was, fair madam.
         
         PRINCESS	                  When you then were here,
         	What did you whisper in your lady's ear?
         
         FERDINAND	That more than all the world I did respect her.
         
         PRINCESS	When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
         
         FERDINAND	Upon mine honour, no.
         
         PRINCESS	Peace, peace! forbear:
         	Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
         
         FERDINAND	Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
         
         PRINCESS	I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
         	What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
         
         ROSALINE	Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
         	As precious eyesight, and did value me
         	Above this world; adding thereto moreover
         	That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
         
         PRINCESS	God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
         	Most honourably doth unhold his word.
         
         FERDINAND	What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
         	I never swore this lady such an oath.
         
         ROSALINE	By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
         	You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
         
         FERDINAND	My faith and this the princess I did give:
         	I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
         
         PRINCESS	Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
         	And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
         	What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
         
         BIRON	Neither of either; I remit both twain.
         	I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
         	Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
         	To dash it  a Christmas comedy:
         	Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
         	Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
         	That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
         	To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
         	Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
         	The ladies did change favours: and then we,
         	Following the signs, wooed but the sign of she.
         	Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
         	We are again forsworn, in will and error.
         	Much upon this it is: and might not you
         
         	[To BOYET]
         
         	Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
         	Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
         	And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
         	And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
         	Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
         	You put our page out: go, you are allowed;
         	Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
         	You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
         	Wounds  a leaden sword.
         
         BOYET	Full merrily
         	Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
         
         BIRON	Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
         
         	[Enter COSTARD]
         
         	Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.
         
         COSTARD	O Lord, sir, they would know
         	Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.
         
         BIRON	What, are there but three?
         
         COSTARD	No, sir; but it is vara fine,
         	For every one pursents three.
         
         BIRON	And three times thrice is nine.
         
         COSTARD	Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
         	You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
         	what we know:
         	I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--
         
         BIRON	Is not nine.
         
         COSTARD	Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
         
         BIRON	By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
         
         COSTARD	O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
         	by reckoning, sir.
         
         BIRON	How much is it?
         
         COSTARD	O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
         	sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
         	own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
         	in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.
         
         BIRON	Art thou one of the Worthies?
         
         COSTARD	It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
         	Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
         	the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.
         
         BIRON	Go, bid them prepare.
         
         COSTARD	We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
         	some care.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         FERDINAND	Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.
         
         BIRON	We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
         	To have one show worse than the king's and his company.
         
         FERDINAND	I say they shall not come.
         
         PRINCESS	Nay, my good lord, let me overrule you now:
         	That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
         	Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
         	Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
         	Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
         	When great things labouring perish in their birth.
         
         BIRON	A right description of our sport, my lord.

         	these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
         	These four will change habits, and present the other five.
         
         BIRON	There is five in the first show.
         
         FERDINAND	You are deceived; 'tis not so.

         DUMAIN	He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,

         BIRON	A lemon.

         DUMAIN	No, cloven.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Peace!--
         	The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
         	Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
         	A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
         	From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
         	I am that flower,--
         
         DUMAIN	That mint.
         
         LONGAVILLE	That columbine.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
         
         LONGAVILLE	I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.
         
         DUMAIN	Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
         	beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
         	he was a man. But I will forward with my device.
         
         	[To the PRINCESS]
         
         	Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.
         
         PRINCESS	Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.

         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--
         
         COSTARD	The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
         	is two months on her way.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	What meanest thou?
         
         COSTARD	Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
         	wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
         	her belly already: tis yours.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
         	die.
         
         COSTARD	Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
         	quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
         	him.
         
         DUMAIN	Most rare Pompey!
         
         BOYET	Renowned Pompey!
         
         BIRON	Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
         	Pompey the Huge!
         
         DUMAIN	Hector trembles.
         
         BIRON	Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
         	on! stir them on!
         
         DUMAIN	Hector will challenge him.
         
         BIRON	Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
         	sup a flea.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By the north pole, I do challenge thee.
         
         COSTARD	I will not fight with a pole,  a northern man:
         	I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
         	let me borrow my arms again.
         
         DUMAIN	Room for the incensed Worthies!
         
         COSTARD	I'll do it in my shirt.
         
         DUMAIN	Most resolute Pompey!
         
         MOTH	Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
         	not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
         	you? You will lose your reputation.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
         	in my shirt.
         
         DUMAIN	You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
         
         BIRON	What reason have you for't?
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
         	woolward for penance.
         
         BOYET	True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
         	linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
         	a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
         	his heart for a favour.
         
         	[Enter MERCADE]
         
         MERCADE	God save you, madam!
         
         PRINCESS	Welcome, Mercade;
         	But that thou interruptest our merriment.
         
         MERCADE	I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
         	Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--
         
         PRINCESS	Dead, for my life!
         
         MERCADE	Even so; my tale is told.
         
         BIRON	Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
         
         DON
         ADRIANO DE ARMADO	For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
         	seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
         	discretion, and I will right myself  a soldier.
         
         	[Exeunt Worthies]
         
         FERDINAND	How fares your majesty?
         
         PRINCESS	Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.
         
         FERDINAND	Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.
         
         PRINCESS	Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
         	For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
         	Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
         	In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
         	The liberal opposition of our spirits,
         	If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
         	In the converse of breath: your gentleness
         	Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
         	A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
         	Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
         	For my great suit so easily obtained.
         
         FERDINAND	The extreme parts of time extremely forms
         	All causes to the purpose of his speed,
         	And often at his very loose decides
         	That which long process could not arbitrate:
         	And though the mourning brow of progeny
         	Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
         	The holy suit which fain it would convince,
         	Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
         	Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
         	From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
         	Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
         	As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
         
         PRINCESS	I understand you not: my griefs are double.
         
         BIRON	Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
         	And by these badges understand the king.
         	For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
         	Played foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
         	Hath much deformed us, fashioning our humours
         	Even to the opposed end of our intents:
         	And what in us hath seemed ridiculous,--
         	As love is full of unbefitting strains,
         	All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
         	Formed by the eye and therefore,  the eye,
         	Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
         	Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
         	To every varied object in his glance:
         	Which parti-coated presence of loose love
         	Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
         	Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
         	Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
         	Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
         	Our love being yours, the error that love makes
         	Is wise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
         	By being once false for ever to be true
         	To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
         	And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
         	Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
         
         PRINCESS	We have received your letters full of love;
         	Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
         	And, in our maiden council, rated them
         	At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
         	As bombast and as lining to the time:
         	But more devout than this in our respects
         	Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
         	In their own fashion,  a merriment.
         
         DUMAIN	Our letters, madam, showed much more than jest.
         
         LONGAVILLE	So did our looks.
         
         ROSALINE	                  We did not quote them so.
         
         FERDINAND	Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
         	Grant us your loves.
         
         PRINCESS	A time, methinks, too short
         	To make a world-without-end bargain in.
         	No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
         	Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
         	If for my love, as there is no such cause,
         	You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
         	Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
         	To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
         	Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
         	There stay until the twelve celestial signs
         	Have brought about the annual reckoning.
         	If this austere insociable life
         	Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
         	If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
         	Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
         	But that it bear this trial and last love;
         	Then, at the expiration of the year,
         	Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
         	And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
         	I will be thine; and till that instant shut
         	My woeful self up in a mourning house,
         	Raining the tears of lamentation
         	For the remembrance of my father's death.
         	If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
         	Neither entitled in the other's heart.
         
         FERDINAND	If this, or more than this, I would deny,
         	To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
         	The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
         	Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
         
         BIRON	[And what to me, my love? and what to me?
         
         ROSALINE	You must be purged too, your sins are racked,
         	You are attaint with faults and perjury:
         	Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
         	A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
         	But seek the weary beds of people sick]
         
         DUMAIN	But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?
         
         KATHARINE	A beard, fair health, and honesty;
         	With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
         
         DUMAIN	O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
         
         KATHARINE	Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
         	I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
         	Come when the king doth to my lady come;
         	Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
         
         DUMAIN	I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
         
         KATHARINE	Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
         
         LONGAVILLE	What says Maria?
         
         MARIA	                  At the twelvemonth's end
         	I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
         
         LONGAVILLE	I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
         
         MARIA	The r you; few taller are so young.
         
         BIRON	Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
         	Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
         	What humble suit attends thy answer there:
         	Impose some service on me for thy love.
         
         ROSALINE	Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
         	Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
         	Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
         	Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
         	Which you on all estates will execute
         	That lie within the mercy of your wit.
         	To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
         	And therewithal to win me, if you please,
         	Without the which I am not to be won,
         	You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
         	Visit the speechless sick and still converse
         	With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
         	With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
         	To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
         
         BIRON	To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
         	It cannot be; it is impossible:
         	Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
         
         ROSALINE	Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
         	Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
         	Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
         	A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
         	Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
         	Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
         	Deafed with the clamours of their own dear groans,
         	Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
         	And I will have you and that fault withal;
         	But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
         	And I shall find you empty of that fault,
         	Right joyful of your reformation.
         
         BIRON	A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
         	I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.

         FERDINAND	No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
         
         BIRON	Our wooing doth not end  an old play;
         	Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
         	Might well have made our sport a comedy.

         	And then 'twill end.

         	ROMEO AND JULIET
         
         	PROLOGUE
         
         
         	Two households, both a in dignity,
         	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
         	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
         	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
         	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
         	A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;
         	Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
         	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
         	The fearful passage of their death-marked love,
         	And the continuance of their parents' rage,
         	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
         	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
         	The which if you with patient ears attend,
         	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
         
         
         
         
         	ROMEO AND JULIET
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Verona. A public place.
         
         
         	[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
         	armed with swords and bucklers]
         
         SAMPSON	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
         
         GREGORY	No, for then we should be colliers.
         
         SAMPSON	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
         
         GREGORY	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
         
         SAMPSON	I strike quickly, being moved.
         
         GREGORY	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
         
         SAMPSON	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
         
         GREGORY	To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
         	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runnest away.
         
         SAMPSON	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
         	take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
         
         GREGORY	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
         	to the wall.
         
         SAMPSON	True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
         	are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
         	Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
         	to the wall.
         
         GREGORY	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
         
         SAMPSON	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
         	have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
         	maids, and cut off their heads.
         
         GREGORY	The heads of the maids?
         
         SAMPSON	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
         	take it in what sense thou wilt.
         
         GREGORY	They must take it in sense that feel it.
         
         SAMPSON	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
         	'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
         
         GREGORY	'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
         	hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
         	two of the house of the Montagues.
         
         SAMPSON	My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
         
         GREGORY	How! turn thy back and run?
         
         SAMPSON	Fear me not.
         
         GREGORY	No, marry; I fear thee!
         
         SAMPSON	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
         
         GREGORY	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
         	they list.
         
         SAMPSON	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
         	which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
         
         	[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]
         
         ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
         
         SAMPSON	I do bite my thumb, sir.
         
         ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
         
         SAMPSON	[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say
         	ay?
         
         GREGORY	No.
         
         SAMPSON	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
         	bite my thumb, sir.
         
         GREGORY	Do you quarrel, sir?
         
         ABRAHAM	Quarrel sir! no, sir.
         
         SAMPSON	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
         
         ABRAHAM	No better.
         
         SAMPSON	Well, sir.
         
         GREGORY	Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
         
         SAMPSON	Yes, better, sir.
         
         ABRAHAM	You lie.
         
         SAMPSON	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
         
         	[They fight]
         
         	[Enter BENVOLIO]
         
         BENVOLIO	Part, fools!
         	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
         
         	[Beats down their swords]
         
         	[Enter TYBALT]
         
         TYBALT	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
         	Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
         
         BENVOLIO	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
         	Or manage it to part these men with me.
         
         TYBALT	What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
         	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
         	Have at thee, coward!
         
         	[They fight]
         
         	[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
         	then enter Citizens, with clubs]
         
         First Citizen	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
         	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
         
         	[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]
         
         CAPULET	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
         
         LADY CAPULET	A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
         
         CAPULET	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
         	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
         
         	[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
         
         MONTAGUE	Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
         
         LADY MONTAGUE	Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
         
         	[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]
         
         PRINCE	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
         	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
         	Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
         	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
         	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
         	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
         	Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,
         	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
         	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
         	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
         	Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets,
         	And made Verona's ancient citizens
         	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
         	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
         	Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate:
         	If ever you disturb our streets again,
         	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
         	For this time, all the rest depart away:
         	You Capulet; shall go along with me:
         	And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
         	To know our further pleasure in this case,
         	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
         	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
         
         	[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]
         
         MONTAGUE	Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
         	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
         
         BENVOLIO	Here were the servants of your adversary,
         	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
         	I drew to part them: in the instant came
         	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
         	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
         	He swung about his head and cut the winds,
         	Who nothing hurt withal hissed him in scorn:
         	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
         	Came more and more and fought on part and part,
         	Till the prince came, who parted either part.
         
         LADY MONTAGUE	O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
         	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
         
         BENVOLIO	Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
         	Peered forth the golden window of the east,
         	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
         	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
         	That westward rooteth from the city's side,
         	So early walking did I see your son:
         	Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
         	And stole into the covert of the wood:
         	I, measuring his affections by my own,
         	That most are busied when they're most alone,
         	Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
         	And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
         
         MONTAGUE	Many a morning hath he there been seen,
         	With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
         	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
         	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
         	Should in the furthest east begin to draw
         	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
         	Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
         	And private in his chamber pens himself,
         	Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
         	And makes himself an artificial night:
         	Black and portentous must this humour prove,
         	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
         
         BENVOLIO	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
         
         MONTAGUE	I neither know it nor can learn of him.
         
         BENVOLIO	Have you importuned him by any means?
         
         MONTAGUE	Both by myself and many other friends:
         	But he, his own affections' counsellor,
         	Is to himself--I will not say how true--
         	But to himself so secret and so close,
         	So far from sounding and discovery,
         	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
         	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
         	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
         	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
         	We would as willingly give cure as know.
         
         	[Enter ROMEO]
         
         BENVOLIO	See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
         	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
         
         MONTAGUE	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
         	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
         
         	[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
         
         BENVOLIO	Good-morrow, cousin.
         
         ROMEO	Is the day so young?
         
         BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.
         
         ROMEO	Ay me! sad hours seem long.
         	Was that my father that went hence so fast?
         
         BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
         
         ROMEO	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
         
         BENVOLIO	In love?
         
         ROMEO	Out--
         
         BENVOLIO	Of love?
         
         ROMEO	Out of her favour, where I am in love.
         
         BENVOLIO	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
         	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
         
         ROMEO	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
         	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
         	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
         	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
         	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
         	Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
         	O any thing, of nothing first create!
         	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
         	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
         	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
         	sick health!
         	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
         	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
         	Dost thou not laugh?
         
         BENVOLIO	No, coz, I rather weep.
         
         ROMEO	Good heart, at what?
         
         BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.
         
         ROMEO	Why, such is love's transgression.
         	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
         	Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
         	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
         	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
         	Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
         	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
         	Being vexed a sea nourished with lovers' tears:
         	What is it else? a madness most discreet,
         	A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
         	Farewell, my coz.
         
         BENVOLIO	                  Soft! I will go along;
         	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
         
         ROMEO	Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
         	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
         
         BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
         
         ROMEO	What, shall I groan and tell thee?
         
         BENVOLIO	Groan! why, no.
         	But sadly tell me who.
         
         ROMEO	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
         	Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
         	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
         
         BENVOLIO	I aimed so near, when I supposed you loved.
         
         ROMEO	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
         
         BENVOLIO	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
         
         ROMEO	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
         	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
         	And, in strong proof of chastity well armed,
         	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharmed.
         	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
         	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
         	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
         	O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
         	That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
         
         BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
         
         ROMEO	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
         	For beauty starved with her severity
         	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
         	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
         	To merit bliss by making me despair:
         	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
         	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
         
         BENVOLIO	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
         
         ROMEO	O, teach me how I should forget to think.
         
         BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
         	Examine other beauties.
         
         ROMEO	'Tis the way
         	To call hers exquisite, in question more:
         	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
         	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
         	He that is strucken blind cannot forget
         	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
         	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
         	What doth her beauty serve, but as a note

         CAPULET	But Montague is bound as well as I,
         	In penalty a; and 'tis not hard, I think,
         	For men so old as we to keep the peace.
         
         PARIS	Of honourable reckoning are you both;
         	And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
         	But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
         
         CAPULET	But saying over what I have said before:
         	My child is yet a stranger in the world;
         	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
         	Let two more summers wither in their pride,
         	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
         
         PARIS	Younger than she are happy mothers made.
         
         CAPULET	And too soon marred are those so early made.
         	The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
         	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
         	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
         	My will to her consent is but a part;
         	An she agree, within her scope of choice
         	Lies my consent and fair according voice.
         	This night I hold an old accustomed feast,
         	Whereto I have invited many a guest,
         	Such as I love; and you, among the store,
         	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
         	At my poor house look to behold this night
         	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
         	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
         	When well-apparelled April on the heel
         	Of limping winter treads, even such delight
         	Among fresh female buds shall you this night
         	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
         	And  her most whose merit most shall be:
         	Which on more view, of many mine being one
         	May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
         	Come, go with me.
         
         	[To Servant, giving a paper]
         
         	Go, sirrah, trudge about
         	Through fair Verona; find those persons out
         	Whose names are written there, and to them say,
         	My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
         
         	[Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS]
         
         Servant	Find them out whose names are written here! It is
         	written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
         	yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
         	his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
         	sent to find those persons whose names are here
         	writ, and can never find what names the writing
         	person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
         
         	[Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO]
         
         BENVOLIO	Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
         	One pain is lessened by another's anguish;
         	Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
         	One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
         	Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
         	And the rank poison of the old will die.
         
         ROMEO	Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
         
         BENVOLIO	For what, I pray thee?
         
         ROMEO	For your broken shin.
         
         BENVOLIO	Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
         
         ROMEO	Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
         	Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
         	Whipped and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
         
         Servant	God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
         
         ROMEO	Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
         
         Servant	Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
         	pray, can you read any thing you see?
         
         ROMEO	Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
         
         Servant	Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
         
         ROMEO	Stay, fellow; I can read.

         ROMEO	Whither?
         
         Servant	To supper; to our house.
         
         ROMEO	Whose house?
         
         Servant	My master's.
         
         ROMEO	Indeed, I should have asked you that before.
         
         Servant	Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
         	great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
         	of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
         	Rest you merry!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BENVOLIO	At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
         	Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
         	With all the admired beauties of Verona:
         	Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
         	Compare her face with some that I shall show,
         	And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
         
         ROMEO	When the devout religion of mine eye
         	Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
         	And these, who often drowned could never die,
         	Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
         	One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
         	never saw her match since first the world begun.
         
         BENVOLIO	Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
         	Herself poised with herself in either eye:
         	But in that crystal scales let there be weighed
         	Your lady's love against some other maid
         	That I will show you shining at this feast,
         	And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
         
         ROMEO	I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,

         LADY CAPULET	Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
         
         Nurse	Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
         	I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
         	God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
         
         	[Enter JULIET]
         
         JULIET	How now! who calls?
         
         Nurse	Your mother.
         
         JULIET	Madam, I am here.
         	What is your will?
         
         LADY CAPULET	This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
         	We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
         	I have remembered me, thou's hear our counsel.
         	Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
         
         Nurse	Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
         
         LADY CAPULET	She's not fourteen.
         
         Nurse	I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
         	And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
         	She is not fourteen. How long is it now
         	To Lammas-tide?
         
         LADY CAPULET	                  A fortnight and odd days.
         
         Nurse	Even or odd, of all days in the year,
         	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
         	Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
         	Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
         	She was too good for me: but, as I said,
         	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
         	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
         	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
         	And she was weaned,--I never shall forget it,--
         	Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
         	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
         	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
         	My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
         	Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
         	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
         	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
         	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
         	Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
         	To bid me trudge:
         	And since that time it is eleven years;
         	For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
         	She could have run and waddled all about;
         	For even the day before, she broke her brow:
         	And then my husband--God be with his soul!
         	A' was a merry man--took up the child:
         	'Yea,' quoth he, edost thou fall upon thy face?
         	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
         	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
         	The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
         	To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
         	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
         	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
         	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
         
         LADY CAPULET	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
         
         Nurse	Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
         	To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
         	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
         	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
         	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
         	'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fallest upon thy face?
         	Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
         	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
         
         JULIET	And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
         
         Nurse	Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
         	Thou wast the prettiest babe that ever I nursed:
         	An I might live to see thee married once,
         	I have my wish.
         
         LADY CAPULET	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
         	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
         	How stands your disposition to be married?
         
         JULIET	It is an honour that I dream not of.
         
         Nurse	An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
         	I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy teat.
         
         LADY CAPULET	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
         	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
         	Are made already mothers: by my count,
         	I was your mother much upon these years
         	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
         	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
         
         Nurse	A man, young lady! lady, such a man
         	As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
         
         LADY CAPULET	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
         
         Nurse	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
         
         LADY CAPULET	What say you? can you love the gentleman?
         	This night you shall behold him at our feast;
         	Read over the volume of young Paris' face,
         	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
         	Examine every married lineament,
         	And see how one another lends content
         	And what obscured in this fair volume lies
         	Find written in the margent of his eyes.
         	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
         	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
         	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
         	For fair without the fair within to hide:
         	That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
         	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
         	So shall you share all that he doth possess,
         	By having him, making yourself no less.
         
         Nurse	No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
         
         LADY CAPULET	Speak briefly, can you  of Paris' love?
         
         JULIET	I'll look to , if looking liking move:
         	But no more deep will I endart mine eye
         	Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

         ROMEO	What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
         	Or shall we on without a apology?
         
         BENVOLIO	The date is out of such prolixity:
         	We'll have no Cupid hoodwinked with a scarf,
         	Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
         	Scaring the ladies  a crow-keeper;
         	Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
         	After the prompter, for our entrance:
         	But let them measure us by what they will;
         	We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
         
         ROMEO	Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
         	Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
         
         MERCUTIO	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
         
         ROMEO	Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
         	With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
         	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
         
         MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
         	And soar with them above a common bound.
         
         ROMEO	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
         	To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
         	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
         	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
         
         MERCUTIO	And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
         	Too great oppression for a tender thing.
         
         ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
         	Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks  thorn.
         
         MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
         	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
         	Give me a case to put my visage in:
         	A visor for a visor! what care I
         	What curious eye doth quote deformities?
         	Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
         
         BENVOLIO	Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
         	But every man betake him to his legs.
         
         ROMEO	A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
         	Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
         	For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase;
         	I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
         	The game was never so fair, and I am done.
         
         MERCUTIO	Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
         	If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
         	Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stickest
         	Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
         
         ROMEO	Nay, that's not so.
         
         MERCUTIO	I mean, sir, in delay
         	We waste our lights in vain,  lamps by day.
         	Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
         	Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
         
         ROMEO	And we mean well in going to this mask;
         	But 'tis no wit to go.
         
         MERCUTIO	Why, may one ask?
         
         ROMEO	I dreamed a dream to-night.
         
         MERCUTIO	And so did I.
         
         ROMEO	Well, what was yours?
         
         MERCUTIO	That dreamers often lie.
         
         ROMEO	In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
         
         MERCUTIO	O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
         	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
         	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
         	On the fore-finger of an alderman,
         	Drawn with a team of little atomies
         	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
         	Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
         	The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
         	The traces of the smallest spider's web,
         	The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
         	Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
         	Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
         	Not so big as a round little worm
         	Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid;
         	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
         	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
         	Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
         	And in this state she gallops night by night
         	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
         	Over courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
         	Over lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
         	Over ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
         	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
         	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
         	Sometime she gallops over a courtier's nose,
         	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
         	And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
         	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
         	Then dreams, he of another benefice:
         	Sometime she driveth over a soldier's neck,
         	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
         	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
         	Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
         	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
         	And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
         	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
         	That plats the manes of horses in the night,
         	And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
         	Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
         	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
         	That presses them and learns them first to bear,
         	Making them women of good carriage:
         	This is she--

         MERCUTIO	True, I talk of dreams,
         	Which are the children of an idle brain,
         	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
         	Which is as thin of substance as the air
         	And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
         	Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
         	And, being angered, puffs away from thence,
         	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
         
         BENVOLIO	This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
         	Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
         
         ROMEO	I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
         	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
         	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
         	With this night's revels and expire the term
         	Of a despised life closed in my breast
         	By some vile forfeit of untimely death.

         	shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
         
         Second Servant	When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
         	hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
         
         First Servant	Away with the joint-stools, remove the

         First Servant	You are looked for and called for, asked for and
         	sought for, in the great chamber.
         
         Second Servant	We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
         	brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

         CAPULET	Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
         	Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
         	Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
         	Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
         	She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
         	Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
         	That I have worn a visor and could tell
         	A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
         	Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
         	You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
         	A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
         
         	[Music plays, and they dance]
         
         	More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
         	And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
         	Ah, sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes well.
         	Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
         	For you and I are past our dancing days:
         	How long is't now since last yourself and I
         	Were in a mask?
         
         Second Capulet	                  By'r lady, thirty years.
         
         CAPULET	What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
         	'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
         	Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
         	Some five and twenty years; and then we masked.
         
         Second Capulet	'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
         	His son is thirty.
         
         CAPULET	                  Will you tell me that?
         	His son was but a ward two years ago.

         	Of yonder knight?
         
         Servant	I know not, sir.
         
         ROMEO	O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
         	It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
         	 a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
         	Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
         	So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
         	As yonder lady over her fellows shows.
         	The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
         	And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
         	Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
         	For I never saw true beauty till this night.
         
         TYBALT	This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
         	Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
         	Come hither, covered with an antic face,
         	To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
         	Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
         	To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

         TYBALT	Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,

         CAPULET	Young Romeo is it?
         
         TYBALT	'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
         
         CAPULET	Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
         	He bears him  a portly gentleman;
         	And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
         	To be a virtuous and well-governed youth:
         	I would not for the wealth of all the town
         	Here in my house do him disparagement:
         	Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
         	It is my will, the which if thou respect,
         	Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
         	And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
         
         TYBALT	It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
         	I'll not endure him.
         
         CAPULET	He shall be endured:
         	What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
         	Am I the master here, or you? go to.
         	You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
         	You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
         	You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
         
         TYBALT	Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
         
         CAPULET	Go to, go to;
         	You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
         	This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
         	You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
         	Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
         	Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
         	I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
         
         TYBALT	Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
         	Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
         	I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
         	Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         ROMEO	[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand
         	This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
         	My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
         	To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
         
         JULIET	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
         	Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
         	For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
         	And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
         
         ROMEO	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
         
         JULIET	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
         
         ROMEO	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
         	They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
         
         JULIET	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
         
         ROMEO	Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
         	Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
         
         JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
         
         ROMEO	Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
         	Give me my sin again.
         
         JULIET	You kiss by the book.
         
         Nurse	Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

         	Her mother is the lady of the house,
         	And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
         	I nursed her daughter, that you talked withal;
         	I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
         	Shall have the chinks.
         
         ROMEO	Is she a Capulet?
         	O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

         ROMEO	Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
         
         CAPULET	Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
         	We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
         	Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
         	I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.

         	The only son of your great enemy.
         
         JULIET	My only love sprung from my only hate!
         	Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
         	Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
         	That I must love a loathed enemy.

         	A betwitched by the charm of looks,
         	But to his foe supposed he must complain,
         	And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
         	Being held a foe, he may not have access
         	To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
         	And she as much in love, her means much less

         	But passion lends them power, time means, to meet

         	Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;

         	He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;

         	By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
         	By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
         	And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,

         BENVOLIO	And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
         
         MERCUTIO	This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
         	To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
         	Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
         	Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
         	That were some spite: my invocation

         	An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
         	Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;

         	Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
         	Having some business, do entreat her eyes
         	To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
         	What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
         	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
         	As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
         	Would through the airy region stream so bright
         	That birds would sing and think it were not night.
         	See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
         	O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
         	That I might touch that cheek!
         
         JULIET	Ay me!
         
         ROMEO	She speaks:
         	O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
         	As glorious to this night, being over my head
         	As is a winged messenger of heaven
         	Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
         	Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
         	When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
         	And sails upon the bosom of the air.
         
         JULIET	O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
         	Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
         	Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
         	And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
         
         ROMEO	[Aside]  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
         
         JULIET	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
         	Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
         	What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
         	Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
         	Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
         	What's in a name? that which we call a rose
         	By any other name would smell as sweet;
         	So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
         	Retain that dear perfection which he owes
         	Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
         	And for that name which is no part of thee
         	Take all myself.
         
         ROMEO	                  I take thee at thy word:
         	Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
         	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
         
         JULIET	What man art thou that thus bescreened in night
         	So stumblest on my counsel?
         
         ROMEO	By a name
         	I know not how to tell thee who I am:
         	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
         	Because it is an enemy to thee;
         	Had I it written, I would tear the word.
         
         JULIET	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
         	Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
         	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
         
         ROMEO	Neither, fair saint, if either thee dis.
         
         JULIET	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
         	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
         	And the place death, considering who thou art,
         	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
         
         ROMEO	With love's light wings did I over-perch these walls;
         	For stony limits cannot hold love out,
         	And what love can do that dares love attempt;
         	Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
         
         JULIET	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
         
         ROMEO	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
         	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
         	And I am proof against their enmity.
         
         JULIET	I would not for the world they saw thee here.
         
         ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
         	And but thou love me, let them find me here:
         	My life were better ended by their hate,
         	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
         
         JULIET	By whose direction foundest thou out this place?
         
         ROMEO	By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
         	He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
         	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
         	As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
         	I would adventure for such merchandise.
         
         JULIET	Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
         	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
         	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
         	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
         	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
         	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
         	And I will take thy word: yet if thou swearest,
         	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
         	Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
         	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
         	Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
         	I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
         	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
         	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
         	And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
         	But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
         	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
         	I should have been more strange, I must confess,
         	But that thou overheardest, ere I was ware,
         	My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
         	And not impute this yielding to light love,
         	Which the dark night hath so discovered.
         
         ROMEO	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
         	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
         
         JULIET	O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
         	That monthly changes in her circled orb,
         	Lest that thy love prove wise variable.
         
         ROMEO	What shall I swear by?
         
         JULIET	Do not swear at all;
         	Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
         	Which is the god of my idolatry,
         	And I'll believe thee.
         
         ROMEO	If my heart's dear love--
         
         JULIET	Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
         	I have no joy of this contract to-night:
         	It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
         	Too  the lightning, which doth cease to be
         	Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
         	This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
         	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
         	Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
         	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
         
         ROMEO	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
         
         JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
         
         ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
         
         JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
         	And yet I would it were to give again.
         
         ROMEO	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
         
         JULIET	But to be frank, and give it thee again.
         	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
         	My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
         	My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
         	The more I have, for both are infinite.
         
         	[Nurse calls within]
         
         	I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
         	Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
         	Stay but a little, I will come again.
         
         	[Exit, above]
         
         ROMEO	O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
         	Being in night, all this is but a dream,
         	Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
         
         	[Re-enter JULIET, above]
         
         JULIET	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
         	If that thy bent of love be honourable,
         	Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
         	By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
         	Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
         	And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
         	And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
         
         Nurse	[Within]  Madam!
         
         JULIET	I come, anon.--But if thou meanest not well,
         	I do beseech thee--
         
         Nurse	[Within]  Madam!
         
         JULIET	By and by, I come:--
         	To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
         	To-morrow will I send.
         
         ROMEO	So thrive my soul--
         
         JULIET	A thousand times good night!
         
         	[Exit, above]
         
         ROMEO	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
         	Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
         	their books,
         	But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
         
         	[Retiring]
         
         	[Re-enter JULIET, above]
         
         JULIET	Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
         	To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
         	Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
         	Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
         	And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
         	With repetition of my Romeo's name.
         
         ROMEO	It is my soul that calls upon my name:
         	How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
         	 softest music to attending ears!
         
         JULIET	Romeo!
         
         ROMEO	     My dear?
         
         JULIET	                  At what o'clock to-morrow
         	Shall I send to thee?
         
         ROMEO	At the hour of nine.
         
         JULIET	I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
         	I have forgot why I did call thee back.
         
         ROMEO	Let me stand here till thou remember it.
         
         JULIET	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
         	Remembering how I love thy company.
         
         ROMEO	And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
         	Forgetting any other home but this.
         
         JULIET	'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
         	And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
         	Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
         	 a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
         	And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
         	So loving-jealous of his liberty.
         
         ROMEO	I would I were thy bird.
         
         JULIET	Sweet, so would I:
         	Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
         	Good night, good night! parting is such
         	sweet sorrow,
         	That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

         SCENE I	Friar Laurence's cell.
         
         
         	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket]
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
         	Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
         	And flecked darkness  a drunkard reels
         	From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
         	Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
         	The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
         	I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
         	With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
         	The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
         	What is her burying grave that is her womb,
         	And from her womb children of divers kind
         	We sucking on her natural bosom find,
         	Many for many virtues excellent,
         	None but for some and yet all different.
         	O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
         	In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
         	For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
         	But to the earth some special good doth give,
         	Nor aught so good but strained from that fair use
         	Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
         	Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
         	And vice sometimes by action dignified.
         	Within the infant rind of this small flower
         	Poison hath residence and medicine power:
         	For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
         	Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
         	Two such opposed kings encamp them still
         	In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
         	And where the worser is predominant,
         	Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
         
         	[Enter ROMEO]
         
         ROMEO	Good morrow, father.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Benedicite!
         	What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
         	Young son, it argues a distempered head
         	So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
         	Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
         	And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
         	But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain
         	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
         	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
         	Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
         	Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
         	Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
         
         ROMEO	That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
         
         ROMEO	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
         	I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
         
         ROMEO	I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
         	I have been feasting with mine enemy,
         	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
         	That's by me wounded: both our remedies
         	Within thy help and holy physic lies:
         	I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
         	My intercession wise steads my foe.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
         	Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
         
         ROMEO	Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
         	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
         	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
         	And all combined, save what thou must combine
         	By holy marriage: when and where and how
         	We met, we wooed and made exchange of vow,
         	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
         	That thou consent to marry us to-day.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
         	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
         	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
         	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
         	Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
         	Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
         	How much salt water thrown away in waste,
         	To season love, that of it doth not taste!
         	The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
         	Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
         	Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
         	Of an old tear that is not washed off yet:
         	If ever thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
         	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
         	And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
         	Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
         
         ROMEO	Thou chidest me oft for loving Rosaline.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
         
         ROMEO	And badest me bury love.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Not in a grave,
         	To lay one in, another out to have.
         
         ROMEO	I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
         	Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
         	The other did not so.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	O, she knew well
         	Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
         	But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
         	In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
         	For this alliance may so happy prove,
         	To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
         
         ROMEO	O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

         	Came he not home to-night?
         
         BENVOLIO	Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
         
         MERCUTIO	Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
         	Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
         
         BENVOLIO	Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
         	Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
         
         MERCUTIO	A challenge, on my life.
         
         BENVOLIO	Romeo will answer it.
         
         MERCUTIO	Any man that can write may answer a letter.
         
         BENVOLIO	Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
         	dares, being dared.
         
         MERCUTIO	Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
         	white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
         	love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
         	blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
         	encounter Tybalt?
         
         BENVOLIO	Why, what is Tybalt?
         
         MERCUTIO	More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
         	the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
         	you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
         	proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
         	the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
         	button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
         	very first house, of the first and second cause:
         	ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
         	hai!
         
         BENVOLIO	The what?
         
         MERCUTIO	The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
         	fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
         	a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
         	whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
         	grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
         	these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
         	perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
         	that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
         	bones, their bones!
         
         	[Enter ROMEO]
         
         BENVOLIO	Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
         
         MERCUTIO	Without his roe,  a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
         	how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
         	that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
         	kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
         	be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
         	Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
         	eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
         	Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
         	to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
         	fairly last night.
         
         ROMEO	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
         
         MERCUTIO	The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
         
         ROMEO	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
         	such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
         
         MERCUTIO	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
         	constrains a man to bow in the hams.
         
         ROMEO	Meaning, to court'sy.
         
         MERCUTIO	Thou hast most kindly hit it.
         
         ROMEO	A most courteous exposition.
         
         MERCUTIO	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
         
         ROMEO	Pink for flower.
         
         MERCUTIO	Right.
         
         ROMEO	Why, then is my pump well flowered.
         
         MERCUTIO	Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
         	worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
         	is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
         
         ROMEO	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
         	singleness.
         
         MERCUTIO	Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
         
         ROMEO	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
         
         MERCUTIO	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
         	done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
         	thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
         	was I with you there for the goose?
         
         ROMEO	Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
         	not there for the goose.
         
         MERCUTIO	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
         
         ROMEO	Nay, good goose, bite not.
         
         MERCUTIO	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
         	sharp sauce.
         
         ROMEO	And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
         
         MERCUTIO	O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
         	inch narrow to an ell broad!
         
         ROMEO	I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
         	to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
         
         MERCUTIO	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
         	now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
         	thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
         	for this drivelling love is  a great natural,
         	that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
         
         BENVOLIO	Stop there, stop there.
         
         MERCUTIO	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
         
         BENVOLIO	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
         
         MERCUTIO	O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
         	for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
         	meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
         
         ROMEO	Here's goodly gear!
         
         	[Enter Nurse and PETER]
         
         MERCUTIO	A sail, a sail!
         
         BENVOLIO	Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
         
         Nurse	Peter!
         
         PETER	Anon!
         
         Nurse	My fan, Peter.
         
         MERCUTIO	Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
         	fairer face.
         
         Nurse	God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
         
         MERCUTIO	God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
         
         Nurse	Is it good den?
         
         MERCUTIO	'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
         	dial is now upon the prick of noon.
         
         Nurse	Out upon you! what a man are you!
         
         ROMEO	One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
         	mar.
         
         Nurse	By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
         	quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
         	may find the young Romeo?
         
         ROMEO	I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
         	you have found him than he was when you sought him:
         	I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
         
         Nurse	You say well.
         
         MERCUTIO	Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
         	wisely, wisely.
         
         Nurse	if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
         	you.
         
         BENVOLIO	She will indite him to some supper.
         
         MERCUTIO	A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
         
         ROMEO	What hast thou found?
         
         MERCUTIO	No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
         	that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
         
         	[Sings]
         
         	An old hare hoar,
         	And an old hare hoar,
         	Is very good meat in lent
         	But a hare that is hoar
         	Is too much for a score,
         	When it hoars ere it be spent.
         	Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
         	to dinner, thither.
         
         ROMEO	I will follow you.
         
         MERCUTIO	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
         
         	[Singing]
         
         	'lady, lady, lady.'
         
         	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]
         
         Nurse	Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
         	merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
         
         ROMEO	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
         	and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
         	to in a month.
         
         Nurse	An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
         	down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
         	Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
         	Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
         	none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
         	too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
         
         PETER	I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
         	should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
         	draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
         	good quarrel, and the law on my side.
         
         Nurse	Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
         	me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
         	and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
         	out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
         	but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
         	a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
         	kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
         	is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
         	with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
         	to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
         
         ROMEO	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
         	protest unto thee--
         
         Nurse	Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
         	Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
         
         ROMEO	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
         
         Nurse	I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
         	I take it, is a gentleman offer.
         
         ROMEO	Bid her devise
         	Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
         	And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
         	Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
         
         Nurse	No truly sir; not a penny.
         
         ROMEO	Go to; I say you shall.
         
         Nurse	This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
         
         ROMEO	And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
         	Within this hour my man shall be with thee
         	And bring thee cords made  a tackled stair;
         	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
         	Must be my convoy in the secret night.
         	Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
         	Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
         
         Nurse	Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
         
         ROMEO	What sayest thou, my dear nurse?
         
         Nurse	Is your man secret? Did you never hear say,
         	Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
         
         ROMEO	I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
         
         NURSE	Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
         	Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
         	is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
         	lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
         	see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
         	sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
         	man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
         	as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
         	rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
         
         ROMEO	Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
         
         Nurse	Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
         	the--No; I know it begins with some other
         	letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
         	it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
         	to hear it.
         
         ROMEO	Commend me to thy lady.
         
         Nurse	Ay, a thousand times.
         
         	[Exit Romeo]
         	Peter!
         
         PETER	Anon!
         
         Nurse	Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

         SCENE V	Capulet's orchard.
         
         
         	[Enter JULIET]
         
         JULIET	The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
         	In half an hour she promised to return.
         	Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
         	O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
         	Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
         	Driving back shadows over louring hills:
         	Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw love,
         	And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
         	Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
         	Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
         	Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
         	Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
         	She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
         	My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
         	And his to me:
         	But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
         	Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
         	O God, she comes!
         
         	[Enter Nurse and PETER]
         
         	O honey nurse, what news?
         	Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
         
         Nurse	Peter, stay at the gate.
         
         	[Exit PETER]
         
         JULIET	Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why lookest thou sad?
         	Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
         	If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
         	By playing it to me with so sour a face.
         
         Nurse	I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
         	Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
         
         JULIET	I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
         	Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
         
         Nurse	Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
         	Do you not see that I am out of breath?
         
         JULIET	How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
         	To say to me that thou art out of breath?
         	The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
         	Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
         	Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
         	Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
         	Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
         
         Nurse	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
         	how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
         	face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
         	all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
         	though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
         	past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
         	but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
         	ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
         
         JULIET	No, no: but all this did I know before.
         	What says he of our marriage? what of that?
         
         Nurse	Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
         	It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
         	My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
         	Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
         	To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
         
         JULIET	I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
         	Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
         
         Nurse	Your love says,  an honest gentleman, and a
         	courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
         	warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
         
         JULIET	Where is my mother! why, she is within;
         	Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
         	'Your love says,  an honest gentleman,
         	Where is your mother?'
         
         Nurse	O God's lady dear!
         	Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
         	Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
         	Henceforward do your messages yourself.
         
         JULIET	Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
         
         Nurse	Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
         
         JULIET	I have.
         
         Nurse	Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
         	There stays a husband to make you a wife:
         	Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
         	They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
         	Hie you to church; I must another way,
         	To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
         	Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
         	I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
         	But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
         	Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
         
         JULIET	Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

         	That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
         
         ROMEO	Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
         	It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
         	That one short minute gives me in her sight:
         	Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
         	Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
         	It is enough I may but call her mine.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	These violent delights have violent ends
         	And in their triumph die,  fire and powder,
         	Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
         	Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
         	And in the taste confounds the appetite:
         	Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
         	Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

         	Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
         	Will never wear out the everlasting flint:
         	A lover may bestride the gossamer
         	That idles in the wanton summer air,
         	And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
         
         JULIET	Good even to my ghostly confessor.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
         
         JULIET	As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
         
         ROMEO	Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
         	Be heaped  mine and that thy skill be more
         	To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
         	This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
         	Unfold the imagined happiness that both
         	Receive in either by this dear encounter.
         
         JULIET	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
         	Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
         	They are but beggars that can count their worth;
         	But my true love is grown to such excess
         	I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
         	For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone

         BENVOLIO	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
         	The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
         	And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
         	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
         
         MERCUTIO	Thou art  one of those fellows that when he
         	enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
         	upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
         	thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
         	it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
         
         BENVOLIO	Am I  such a fellow?
         
         MERCUTIO	Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
         	any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
         	soon moody to be moved.
         
         BENVOLIO	And what to?
         
         MERCUTIO	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
         	shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
         	thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
         	or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
         	wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
         	other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
         	eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
         	Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
         	meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
         	an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
         	man for coughing in the street, because he hath
         	wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
         	didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
         	his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
         	tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
         	wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
         
         BENVOLIO	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
         	should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
         
         MERCUTIO	The fee-simple! O simple!
         
         BENVOLIO	By my head, here come the Capulets.

         	Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
         
         MERCUTIO	And but one word with one of us? couple it with
         	something; make it a word and a blow.
         
         TYBALT	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
         	will give me occasion.
         
         MERCUTIO	Could you not take some occasion without giving?
         
         TYBALT	Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo,--

         	Either withdraw unto some private place,
         	And reason coldly of your grievances,
         	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

         TYBALT	Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
         	No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
         
         ROMEO	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
         	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
         	To such a greeting: villain am I none;
         	Therefore farewell; I see thou knowest me not.
         
         TYBALT	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
         	That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
         
         ROMEO	I do protest, I never injured thee,
         	But love thee better than thou canst devise,
         	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
         	And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
         	As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

         	O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
         	For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
         	O cousin, cousin!
         
         PRINCE	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
         
         BENVOLIO	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
         	Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
         	How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
         	Your high displeasure: all this uttered
         	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed,
         	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
         	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
         	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
         	Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
         	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
         	Cold death aside, and with the other sends
         	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
         	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
         	'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
         	his tongue,
         	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
         	And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
         	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
         	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
         	But by and by comes back to Romeo,
         	Who had but newly entertained revenge,
         	And to 't they go  lightning, for, ere I
         	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
         	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
         	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
         
         LADY CAPULET	He is a kinsman to the Montague;
         	Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
         	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
         	And all those twenty could but kill one life.
         	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
         	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
         
         PRINCE	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
         	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
         
         MONTAGUE	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
         	His fault concludes but what the law should end,
         	The life of Tybalt.
         
         PRINCE	And for that offence
         	Immediately we do exile him hence:
         	I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
         	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
         	But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
         	That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
         	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
         	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
         	Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
         	Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
         	Bear hence this body and attend our will:
         	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

         	Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
         	That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
         	Leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.
         	Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
         	By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
         	It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
         	Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
         	And learn me how to lose a winning match,
         	Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
         	Hood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,
         	With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
         	Think true love acted simple modesty.
         	Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
         	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
         	Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
         	Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-browed night,
         	Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
         	Take him and cut him out in little stars,
         	And he will make the face of heaven so fine
         	That all the world will be in love with night
         	And pay no worship to the garish sun.
         	O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
         	But not possessed it, and, though I am sold,
         	Not yet enjoyed: so tedious is this day
         	As is the night before some festival
         	To an impatient child that hath new robes
         	And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
         	And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
         	But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.

         	Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
         	Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
         
         JULIET	What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
         	This torture should be roared in dismal hell.
         	Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
         	And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
         	Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
         	I am not I, if there be such an I;
         	Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
         	If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
         	Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
         
         Nurse	I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
         	God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
         	A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
         	Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood,
         	All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
         
         JULIET	O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
         	To prison, eyes, never look on liberty!
         	Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
         	And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
         
         Nurse	O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
         	O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
         	That ever I should live to see thee dead!
         
         JULIET	What storm is this that blows so contrary?
         	Is Romeo slaughtered, and is Tybalt dead?
         	My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
         	Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
         	For who is living, if those two are gone?
         
         Nurse	Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
         	Romeo that killed him, he is banished.
         
         JULIET	O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
         
         Nurse	It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
         
         JULIET	O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
         	Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
         	Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
         	Dove-feathered raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
         	Despised substance of divinest show!
         	Just opposite to what thou justly seemest,
         	A damned saint, an honourable villain!
         	O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
         	When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
         	In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
         	Was ever book containing such vile matter
         	So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
         	In such a gorgeous palace!
         
         Nurse	There's no trust,
         	No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
         	All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
         	Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
         	These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
         	Shame come to Romeo!
         
         JULIET	Blistered be thy tongue
         	For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
         	Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
         	For 'tis a throne where honour may be crowned
         	Sole monarch of the universal earth.
         	O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
         
         Nurse	Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
         
         JULIET	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
         	Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
         	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
         	But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
         	That villain cousin would have killed my husband:
         	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
         	Your tributary drops belong to woe,
         	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
         	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
         	And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
         	All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
         	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
         	That murdered me: I would forget it fain;
         	But, O, it presses to my memory,
         	 damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
         	'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
         	That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
         	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
         	Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
         	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
         	And needly will be ranked with other griefs,
         	Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
         	Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
         	Which modern lamentations might have moved?
         	But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
         	'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
         	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
         	All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
         	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
         	In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
         	Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
         
         Nurse	Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
         	Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
         
         JULIET	Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
         	When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
         	Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
         	Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
         	He made you for a highway to my bed;
         	But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
         	Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
         	And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
         
         Nurse	Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
         	To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
         	Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
         	I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
         
         JULIET	O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
         	And bid him come to take his last farewell.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Friar Laurence's cell.
         
         
         	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
         	Affliction is enamoured of thy parts,
         	And thou art wedded to calamity.
         
         	[Enter ROMEO]
         
         ROMEO	Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
         	What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
         	That I yet know not?
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Too familiar
         	Is my dear son with such sour company:
         	I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
         
         ROMEO	What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	A gentler judgment vanished from his lips,
         	Not body's death, but body's banishment.
         
         ROMEO	Ha, banishment! be merciful, say edeath;'
         	For exile hath more terror in his look,
         	Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Hence from Verona art thou banished:
         	Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
         
         ROMEO	There is no world without Verona walls,
         	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
         	Hence-banished is banished from the world,
         	And world's exile is death: then banished,
         	Is death mis-termed: calling death banishment,
         	Thou cuttest my head off with a golden axe,
         	And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
         	Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
         	Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law,
         	And turned that black word death to banishment:
         	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
         
         ROMEO	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
         	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
         	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
         	Live here in heaven and may look on her;
         	But Romeo may not: more validity,
         	More honourable state, more courtship lives
         	In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
         	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
         	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
         	Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
         	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
         	But Romeo may not; he is banished:
         	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
         	They are free men, but I am banished.
         	And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
         	Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife,
         	No sudden mean of death, though never so mean,
         	But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
         	O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
         	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
         	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
         	A sin-absolver, and my friend professed,
         	To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
         
         ROMEO	O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
         	Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
         	To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
         
         ROMEO	Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
         	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
         	Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
         	It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
         
         ROMEO	How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
         
         ROMEO	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
         	Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
         	An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
         	Doting  me and  me banished,
         	Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
         	And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
         	Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
         
         	[Knocking within]
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
         
         ROMEO	Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
         	Mist-, infold me from the search of eyes.
         
         	[Knocking]
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
         	Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
         
         	[Knocking]
         
         	Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
         	What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
         
         	[Knocking]
         
         	Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
         
         Nurse	[Within]  Let me come in, and you shall know
         	my errand;
         	I come from Lady Juliet.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Welcome, then.
         
         	[Enter Nurse]
         
         Nurse	O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
         	Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
         
         Nurse	O, he is even in my mistress' case,
         	Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
         	Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
         	Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
         	Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
         	For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
         	Why should you fall into so deep an O?
         
         ROMEO	Nurse!
         
         Nurse	Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
         
         ROMEO	Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
         	Doth she not think me an old murderer,
         	Now I have stained the childhood of our joy
         	With blood removed but little from her own?
         	Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
         	My concealed lady to our cancelled love?
         
         Nurse	O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
         	And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
         	And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
         	And then down falls again.
         
         ROMEO	As if that name,
         	Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
         	Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
         	Murdered her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
         	In what vile part of this anatomy
         	Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
         	The hateful mansion.
         
         	[Drawing his sword]
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold thy desperate hand:
         	Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
         	Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
         	The unreasonable fury of a beast:
         	Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
         	Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
         	Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
         	I thought thy disposition better tempered.
         	Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
         	And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
         	By doing damned hate upon thyself?
         	Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
         	Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
         	In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
         	Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
         	Which,  a usurer, aboundest in all,
         	And usest none in that true use indeed
         	Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
         	Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
         	Digressing from the valour of a man;
         	Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
         	Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish;
         	Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
         	Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
         	 powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
         	Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
         	And thou dismembered with thine own defence.
         	What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
         	For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
         	There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
         	But thou slewest Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
         	The law that threatened death becomes thy friend
         	And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
         	A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
         	Happiness courts thee in her best array;
         	But,  a misbehaved and sullen wench,
         	Thou poutest upon thy fortune and thy love:
         	Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
         	Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
         	Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
         	But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
         	For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
         	Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
         	To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
         	Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
         	With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
         	Than thou wentest forth in lamentation.
         	Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
         	And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
         	Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
         	Romeo is coming.
         
         Nurse	O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night
         	To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
         	My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
         
         ROMEO	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
         
         Nurse	Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
         	Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         ROMEO	How well my comfort is revived by this!
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
         	Either be gone before the watch be set,
         	Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
         	Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
         	And he shall signify from time to time
         	Every good hap to you that chances here:
         	Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
         
         ROMEO	But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
         	It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         SCENE 	A room in Capulet's house.
         
         
         	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS]
         
         CAPULET	Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
         	That we have had no time to move our daughter:
         	Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
         	And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
         	'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
         	I promise you, but for your company,
         	I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
         
         PARIS	These times of woe afford no time to woo.
         	Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
         
         LADY CAPULET	I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
         	To-night she is mewed up to her heaviness.
         
         CAPULET	Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
         	Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
         	In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
         	Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
         	Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
         	And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
         	But, soft! what day is this?
         
         PARIS	Monday, my lord,
         
         CAPULET	Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
         	O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
         	She shall be married to this noble earl.
         	Will you be ready? do you  this haste?
         	We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
         	For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
         	It may be thought we held him carelessly,
         	Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
         	Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
         	And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
         
         PARIS	My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
         
         CAPULET	Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
         	Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
         	Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
         	Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
         	Afore me! it is so very very late,
         	That we may call it early by and by.
         	Good night.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         
         
         
         	ROMEO AND JULIET
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE V	Capulet's orchard.
         
         
         	[Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window]
         
         JULIET	Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
         	It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
         	That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
         	Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
         	Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
         
         ROMEO	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
         	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
         	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
         	Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
         	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
         	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
         
         JULIET	Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
         	It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
         	To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
         	And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
         	Therefore stay yet; thou needest not to be gone.
         
         ROMEO	Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
         	I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
         	I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
         	'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
         	Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
         	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
         	I have more care to stay than will to go:
         	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
         	How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
         
         JULIET	It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
         	It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
         	Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
         	Some say the lark makes sweet division;
         	This doth not so, for she divideth us:
         	Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
         	O, now I would they had changed voices too!
         	Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
         	Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
         	O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
         
         ROMEO	More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
         
         	[Enter Nurse, to the chamber]
         
         Nurse	Madam!
         
         JULIET	Nurse?
         
         Nurse	Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
         	The day is broke; be wary, look about.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         JULIET	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
         
         ROMEO	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
         
         	[He goeth down]
         
         JULIET	Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
         	I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
         	For in a minute there are many days:
         	O, by this count I shall be much in years
         	Ere I again behold my Romeo!
         
         ROMEO	Farewell!
         	I will omit no opportunity
         	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
         
         JULIET	O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?
         
         ROMEO	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
         	For sweet discourses in our time to come.
         
         JULIET	O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
         	Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
         	As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
         	Either my eyesight fails, or thou lookest pale.
         
         ROMEO	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
         	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         JULIET	O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
         	If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
         	That is renowned for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
         	For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
         	But send him back.
         
         LADY CAPULET	[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?
         
         JULIET	Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
         	Is she not down so late, or up so early?
         	What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?
         
         	[Enter LADY CAPULET]
         
         LADY CAPULET	Why, how now, Juliet!
         
         JULIET	Madam, I am not well.
         
         LADY CAPULET	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
         	What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
         	An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
         	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
         	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
         
         JULIET	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
         
         LADY CAPULET	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
         	Which you weep for.
         
         JULIET	Feeling so the loss,
         	Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
         
         LADY CAPULET	Well, girl, thou weepest not so much for his death,
         	As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.
         
         JULIET	What villain madam?
         
         LADY CAPULET	That same villain, Romeo.
         
         JULIET	[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
         	God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
         	And yet no man  he doth grieve my heart.
         
         LADY CAPULET	That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
         
         JULIET	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
         	Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
         
         LADY CAPULET	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
         	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
         	Where that same banished runagate doth live,
         	Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram,
         	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
         	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
         
         JULIET	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
         	With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
         	Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed.
         	Madam, if you could find out but a man
         	To bear a poison, I would temper it;
         	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
         	Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
         	To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
         	To wreak the love I bore my cousin
         	Upon his body that slaughtered him!
         
         LADY CAPULET	Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
         	But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
         
         JULIET	And joy comes well in such a needy time:
         	What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
         
         LADY CAPULET	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
         	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
         	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
         	That thou expectest not nor I looked not for.
         
         JULIET	Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
         
         LADY CAPULET	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
         	The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
         	The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
         	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
         
         JULIET	Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
         	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
         	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
         	Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
         	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
         	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
         	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
         	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
         
         LADY CAPULET	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
         	And see how he will take it at your hands.
         
         	[Enter CAPULET and Nurse]
         
         CAPULET	When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
         	But for the sunset of my brother's son
         	It rains downright.
         	How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
         	Evermore showering? In one little body
         	Thou counterfeitest a bark, a sea, a wind;
         	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
         	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
         	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
         	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
         	Without a sudden calm, will overset
         	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
         	Have you delivered to her our decree?
         
         LADY CAPULET	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
         	I would the fool were married to her grave!
         
         CAPULET	Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
         	How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
         	Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
         	Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
         	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
         
         JULIET	Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
         	Proud can I never be of what I hate;
         	But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
         
         CAPULET	How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
         	'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
         	And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
         	Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
         	But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
         	To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
         	Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
         	Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
         	You tallow-face!
         
         LADY CAPULET	                  Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
         
         JULIET	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
         	Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
         
         CAPULET	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
         	I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
         	Or never after look me in the face:
         	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
         	My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
         	That God had lent us but this only child;
         	But now I see this one is one too much,
         	And that we have a curse in having her:
         	Out on her, hilding!
         
         Nurse	God in heaven bless her!
         	You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
         
         CAPULET	And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
         	Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
         
         Nurse	I speak no treason.
         
         CAPULET	O, God ye god-den.
         
         Nurse	May not one speak?
         
         CAPULET	                  Peace, you mumbling fool!
         	Utter your gravity over a gossip's bowl;
         	For here we need it not.
         
         LADY CAPULET	You are too hot.
         
         CAPULET	God's bread! it makes me mad:
         	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
         	Alone, in company, still my care hath been
         	To have her matched: and having now provided
         	A gentleman of noble parentage,
         	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly trained,
         	Stuffed, as they say, with honourable parts,
         	Proportioned as one's thought would wish a man;
         	And then to have a wretched puling fool,
         	A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
         	To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
         	I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
         	But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
         	Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
         	Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
         	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
         	An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
         	And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
         	the streets,
         	For, by my soul, I'll never acknowledge thee,
         	Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
         	Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         JULIET	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
         	That sees into the bottom of my grief?
         	O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
         	Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
         	Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
         	In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
         
         LADY CAPULET	Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
         	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         JULIET	O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
         	My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
         	How shall that faith return again to earth,
         	Unless that husband send it me from heaven
         	By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
         	Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
         	Upon so soft a subject as myself!
         	What sayest thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
         	Some comfort, nurse.
         
         Nurse	Faith, here it is.
         	Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing,
         	That he dares never come back to challenge you;
         	Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
         	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
         	I think it best you married with the county.
         	O, he's a lovely gentleman!
         	Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
         	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
         	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
         	I think you are happy in this second match,
         	For it excels your first: or if it did not,
         	Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
         	As living here and you no use of him.
         
         JULIET	Speakest thou from thy heart?
         
         Nurse	And from my soul too;
         	Or else beshrew them both.
         
         JULIET	Amen!
         
         Nurse	What?
         
         JULIET	Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
         	Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
         	Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
         	To make confession and to be absolved.
         
         Nurse	Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         JULIET	Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
         	Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
         	Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
         	Which she hath praised him with above compare
         	So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
         	Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
         	I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
         	If all else fail, myself have power to die.

         SCENE I	Friar Laurence's cell.
         
         
         	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS]
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
         
         PARIS	My father Capulet will have it so;
         	And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	You say you do not know the lady's mind:
         	Uneven is the course, I  it not.
         
         PARIS	Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
         	And therefore have I little talked of love;
         	For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
         	Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
         	That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
         	And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
         	To stop the inundation of her tears;
         	Which, too much minded by herself alone,
         	May be put from her by society:
         	Now do you know the reason of this haste.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slowed.
         	Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
         
         	[Enter JULIET]
         
         PARIS	Happily met, my lady and my wife!
         
         JULIET	That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
         
         PARIS	That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
         
         JULIET	What must be shall be.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	That's a certain text.
         
         PARIS	Come you to make confession to this father?
         
         JULIET	To answer that, I should confess to you.
         
         PARIS	Do not deny to him that you love me.
         
         JULIET	I will confess to you that I love him.
         
         PARIS	So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
         
         JULIET	If I do so, it will be of more price,
         	Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
         
         PARIS	Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
         
         JULIET	The tears have got small victory by that;
         	For it was bad enough before their spite.
         
         PARIS	Thou wrongest it, more than tears, with that report.
         
         JULIET	That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
         	And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
         
         PARIS	Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.
         
         JULIET	It may be so, for it is not mine own.
         	Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
         	Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
         	My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
         
         PARIS	God shield I should disturb devotion!
         	Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
         	Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         JULIET	O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
         	Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
         	It strains me past the compass of my wits:
         	I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
         	On Thursday next be married to this county.
         
         JULIET	Tell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,
         	Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
         	If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
         	Do thou but call my resolution wise,
         	And with this knife I'll help it presently.
         	God joined my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
         	And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo sealed,
         	Shall be the label to another deed,
         	Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
         	Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
         	Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
         	Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
         	'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
         	Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
         	Which the commission of thy years and art
         	Could to no issue of true honour bring.
         	Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
         	If what thou speakest speak not of remedy.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
         	Which craves as desperate an execution.
         	As that is desperate which we would prevent.
         	If, rather than to marry County Paris,
         	Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
         	Then is it ly thou wilt undertake
         	A thing  death to chide away this shame,
         	That copest with death himself to scape from it:
         	And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
         
         JULIET	O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
         	From off the battlements of yonder tower;
         	Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
         	Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
         	Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
         	Over-covered quite with dead men's rattling bones,
         	With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
         	Or bid me go into a new-made grave
         	And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
         	Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
         	And I will do it without fear or doubt,
         	To live an unstained wife to my sweet love.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
         	To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
         	To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
         	Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
         	Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
         	And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
         	When presently through all thy veins shall run
         	A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
         	Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
         	No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
         	The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
         	To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
         	 death, when he shuts up the day of life;
         	Each part, deprived of supple government,
         	Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear  death:
         	And in this borrowed ness of shrunk death
         	Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
         	And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
         	Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
         	To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
         	Then, as the manner of our country is,
         	In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
         	Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
         	Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
         	In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
         	Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
         	And hither shall he come: and he and I
         	Will watch thy waking, and that very night
         	Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
         	And this shall free thee from this present shame;
         	If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
         	Abate thy valour in the acting it.
         
         JULIET	Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
         	In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
         	To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
         
         JULIET	Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
         	Farewell, dear father!

         	Servingmen]

         	[Exit First Servant]
         
         	Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
         
         Second Servant	You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
         	can lick their fingers.
         
         CAPULET	How canst thou try them so?
         
         Second Servant	Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
         	own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
         	fingers goes not with me.
         
         CAPULET	Go, be gone.
         
         	[Exit Second Servant]
         
         	We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
         	What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
         
         Nurse	Ay, forsooth.
         
         CAPULET	Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
         	A peevish self-willed harlotry it is.
         
         Nurse	See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
         
         	[Enter JULIET]
         
         CAPULET	How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
         
         JULIET	Where I have learned me to repent the sin
         	Of disobedient opposition
         	To you and your behests, and am enjoined
         	By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
         	And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
         	Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
         
         CAPULET	Send for the county; go tell him of this:
         	I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
         
         JULIET	I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
         	And gave him what becomed love I might,
         	Not step over the bounds of modesty.
         
         CAPULET	Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
         	This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
         	Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
         	Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
         	Our whole city is much bound to him.
         
         JULIET	Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
         	To help me sort such needful ornaments
         	As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
         
         LADY CAPULET	No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
         
         CAPULET	Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
         
         	[Exeunt JULIET and Nurse]
         
         LADY  CAPULET	We shall be short in our provision:
         	'Tis now near night.
         
         CAPULET	Tush, I will stir about,
         	And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
         	Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
         	I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
         	I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
         	They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
         	To County Paris, to prepare him up
         	Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
         	Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimed.

         	[Enter JULIET and Nurse]
         
         JULIET	Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
         	I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
         	For I have need of many orisons
         	To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
         	Which, well thou knowest, is cross, and full of sin.
         
         	[Enter LADY CAPULET]
         
         LADY CAPULET	What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
         
         JULIET	No, madam; we have culled such necessaries
         	As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
         	So please you, let me now be left alone,
         	And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
         	For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
         	In this so sudden business.
         
         LADY CAPULET	Good night:
         	Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
         
         	[Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse]
         
         JULIET	Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
         	I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
         	That almost freezes up the heat of life:
         	I'll call them back again to comfort me:
         	Nurse! What should she do here?
         	My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
         	Come, vial.
         	What if this mixture do not work at all?
         	Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
         	No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
         
         	[Laying down her dagger]
         
         	What if it be a poison, which the friar
         	Subtly hath ministered to have me dead,
         	Lest in this marriage he should be dishonoured,
         	Because he married me before to Romeo?
         	I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
         	For he hath still been tried a holy man.
         	How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
         	I wake before the time that Romeo
         	Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
         	Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
         	To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
         	And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
         	Or, if I live, is it not very ,
         	The horrible conceit of death and night,
         	Together with the terror of the place,--
         	As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
         	Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
         	Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
         	Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
         	Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
         	At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
         	Alack, alack, is it not  that I,
         	So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
         	And shrieks  mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
         	That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
         	O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
         	Environed with all these hideous fears?
         	And madly play with my forefather's joints?
         	And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
         	And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
         	As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
         	O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
         	Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
         	Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
         	Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

         CAPULET	Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
         	Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
         	Life and these lips have long been separated:
         	Death lies on her  an untimely frost
         	Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
         
         Nurse	O lamentable day!

         	Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

         CAPULET	Ready to go, but never to return.
         	O son! the night before thy wedding-day
         	Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
         	Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
         	Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
         	My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
         	And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

         	In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
         	But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,

         	Never was seen so black a day as this:

         	O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
         
         CAPULET	Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!

         	O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!

         FRIAR LAURENCE	Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
         	In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
         	Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
         	And all the better is it for the maid:
         	Your part in her you could not keep from death,
         	But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
         	The most you sought was her promotion;
         	For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
         	And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
         	Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
         	O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
         	That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
         	She's not well married that lives married long;
         	But she's best married that dies married young.
         	Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
         	On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
         	In all her best array bear her to church:
         	For though fond nature bids us an lament,
         	Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
         
         CAPULET	All things that we ordained festival,
         	Turn from their office to black funeral;
         	Our instruments to melancholy bells,
         	Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
         	Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
         	Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
         	And all things change them to the contrary.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
         	And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare

         	The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
         	Move them no more by crossing their high will.

         First Musician	Why 'Heart's ease?'
         
         PETER	O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My

         	to comfort me.
         
         First Musician	Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

         First Musician	An you re us and fa us, you note us.

         PETER	Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
         
         Second Musician	I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

         Third Musician	Faith, I know not what to say.
         
         PETER	O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
         	for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'

         ROMEO	If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
         	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
         	My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
         	And all this day an unaccustomed spirit
         	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
         	I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
         	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
         	to think!--
         	And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
         	That I revived, and was an emperor.
         	Ah me! how sweet is love itself possessed,
         	When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
         
         	[Enter BALTHASAR, booted]
         
         	News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
         	Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
         	How doth my lady? Is my father well?
         	How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
         	For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
         
         BALTHASAR	Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
         	Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
         	And her immortal part with angels lives.
         	I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
         	And presently took post to tell it you:
         	O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
         	Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
         
         ROMEO	Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
         	Thou knowest my lodging: get me ink and paper,
         	And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
         
         BALTHASAR	I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
         	Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
         	Some misadventure.
         
         ROMEO	                  Tush, thou art deceived:
         	Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
         	Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
         
         BALTHASAR	No, my good lord.
         
         ROMEO	                  No matter: get thee gone,
         	And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
         
         	[Exit BALTHASAR]
         
         	Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
         	Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
         	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
         	I do remember an apothecary,--
         	And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
         	In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,
         	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
         	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
         	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
         	An alligator stuffed, and other skins
         	Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
         	A beggarly account of empty boxes,
         	Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
         	Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
         	Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
         	Noting this penury, to myself I said
         	'An if a man did need a poison now,
         	Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
         	Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
         	O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
         	And this same needy man must sell it me.
         	As I remember, this should be the house.
         	Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
         	What, ho! apothecary!
         
         	[Enter Apothecary]
         
         Apothecary	Who calls so loud?
         
         ROMEO	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
         	Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
         	A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
         	As will disperse itself through all the veins
         	That the life-weary taker may fall dead
         	And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
         	As violently as hasty powder fired
         	Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
         
         Apothecary	Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
         	Is death to any he that utters them.
         
         ROMEO	Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
         	And fearest to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
         	Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
         	Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
         	The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
         	The world affords no law to make thee rich;
         	Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
         
         Apothecary	My poverty, but not my will, consents.
         
         ROMEO	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
         
         Apothecary	Put this in any liquid thing you will,
         	And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
         	Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
         
         ROMEO	There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
         	Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
         	Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
         	I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
         	Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
         	Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
         	To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

         	Is partly to behold my lady's face;
         	But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
         	A precious ring, a ring that I must use
         	In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
         	But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
         	In what I further shall intend to do,
         	By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
         	And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
         	The time and my intents are savage-wild,
         	More fierce and more inexorable far
         	Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
         
         BALTHASAR	I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

         	By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
         	By heaven, I love thee better than myself;

         ROMEO	In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
         	Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
         	What said my man, when my betossed soul
         	Did not attend him as we rode? I think
         	He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
         	Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
         	Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
         	To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
         	One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
         	I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
         	A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughtered youth,
         	For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
         	This vault a feasting presence full of light.
         	Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.
         
         	[Laying PARIS in the tomb]
         
         	How oft when men are at the point of death
         	Have they been merry! which their keepers call
         	A lightning before death: O, how may I
         	Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
         	Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,
         	Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
         	Thou art not conquered; beauty's ensign yet
         	Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
         	And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
         	Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
         	O, what more favour can I do to thee,
         	Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
         	To sunder his that was thine enemy?
         	Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
         	Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
         	That unsubstantial death is amorous,
         	And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
         	Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
         	For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
         	And never from this palace of dim night
         	Depart again: here, here will I remain
         	With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
         	Will I set up my everlasting rest,
         	And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
         	From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
         	Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
         	The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
         	A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
         	Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
         	Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
         	The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
         	Here's to my love!
         
         	[Drinks]
         
         	O true apothecary!
         	Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

         FRIAR LAURENCE	Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
         	What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
         	To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
         	It burneth in the Capel's monument.
         
         BALTHASAR	It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
         	One that you love.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	                  Who is it?

         BALTHASAR	I dare not, sir
         	My master knows not but I am gone hence;
         	And fearfully did menace me with death,
         	If I did stay to look on his intents.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
         	O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
         
         BALTHASAR	As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
         	I dreamt my master and another fought,
         	And that my master slew him.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo!
         
         	[Advances]
         
         	Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
         	The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
         	What mean these masterless and gory swords
         	To lie discoloured by this place of peace?

         	And steeped in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
         	Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
         	The lady stirs.

         	[Noise within]
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
         	Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
         	A greater power than we can contradict
         	Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
         	Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
         	And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
         	Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
         	Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
         	Come, go, good Juliet,
         
         	[Noise again]

         	Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
         	O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
         	To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
         	Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
         	To make die with a restorative.
         
         	[Kisses him]

         FRIAR LAURENCE	I am the greatest, able to do least,
         	Yet most suspected, as the time and place
         	Doth make against me of this direful murder;
         	And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
         	Myself condemned and myself excused.
         
         PRINCE	Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
         
         FRIAR LAURENCE	I will be brief, for my short date of breath
         	Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
         	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
         	And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
         	I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
         	Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
         	Banished the new-made bridegroom from the city,
         	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
         	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
         	Betrothed and would have married her perforce
         	To County Paris: then comes she to me,
         	And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
         	To rid her from this second marriage,
         	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
         	Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
         	A sleeping potion; which so took effect
         	As I intended, for it wrought on her
         	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
         	That he should hither come as this dire night,
         	To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
         	Being the time the potion's force should cease.
         	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
         	Was stayed by accident, and yesternight
         	Returned my letter back. Then all alone
         	At the prefixed hour of her waking,
         	Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
         	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
         	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
         	But when I came, some minute ere the time
         	Of her awaking, here untimely lay
         	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
         	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
         	And bear this work of heaven with patience:
         	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
         	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
         	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
         	All this I know; and to the marriage
         	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
         	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
         	Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
         	Unto the rigour of severest law.
         
         PRINCE	We still have known thee for a holy man.
         	Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
         
         BALTHASAR	I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
         	And then in post he came from Mantua
         	To this same place, to this same monument.
         	This letter he early bid me give his father,
         	And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
         	I departed not and left him there.
         
         PRINCE	Give me the letter; I will look on it.
         	Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
         	Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
         
         PAGE	He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
         	And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
         	Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
         	And by and by my master drew on him;
         	And then I ran away to call the watch.
         
         PRINCE	This letter doth make good the friar's words,
         	Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
         	And here he writes that he did buy a poison
         	Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
         	Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
         	Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
         	See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
         	That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
         	And I for winking at your discords too
         	Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punished.
         
         CAPULET	O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
         	This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
         	Can I demand.
         
         MONTAGUE	                  But I can give thee more:
         	For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
         	That while Verona by that name is known,
         	There shall no figure at such rate be set
         	As that of true and faithful Juliet.
         
         CAPULET	As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
         	Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
         
         PRINCE	A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
         	The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
         	Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
         	Some shall be pardoned, and some punished:
         	For never was a story of more woe

         	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Verona. An open place.
         
         
         	[Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS]
         
         VALENTINE	Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
         	Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
         	Were't not affection chains thy tender days
         	To the sweet glances of thy honoured love,
         	I rather would entreat thy company
         	To see the wonders of the world abroad,
         	Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
         	Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
         	But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
         	Even as I would when I to love begin.
         
         PROTEUS	Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
         	Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
         	Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
         	Wish me partaker in thy happiness
         	When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
         	If ever danger do environ thee,
         	Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
         	For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
         
         VALENTINE	And on a love-book pray for my success?
         
         PROTEUS	Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
         
         VALENTINE	That's on some shallow story of deep love:
         	How young Leander crossed the Hellespont.
         
         PROTEUS	That's a deep story of a deeper love:
         	For he was more than over shoes in love.
         
         VALENTINE	'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
         	And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
         
         PROTEUS	Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
         
         VALENTINE	No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
         
         PROTEUS	What?
         
         VALENTINE	To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
         	Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
         	With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
         	If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
         	If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
         	However, but a folly bought with wit,
         	Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
         
         PROTEUS	So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
         
         VALENTINE	So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
         
         PROTEUS	'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
         
         VALENTINE	Love is your master, for he masters you:
         	And he that is so yoked by a fool,
         	Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
         
         PROTEUS	Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
         	The eating canker dwells, so eating love
         	Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
         
         VALENTINE	And writers say, as the most forward bud
         	Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
         	Even so by love the young and tender wit
         	Is turned to folly, blasting in the bud,
         	Losing his verdure even in the prime
         	And all the fair effects of future hopes.
         	But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
         	That art a votary to fond desire?
         	Once more adieu! my father at the road
         	Expects my coming, there to see me shipped.
         
         PROTEUS	And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
         
         VALENTINE	Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
         	To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
         	Of thy success in love, and what news else
         	Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
         	And wise will visit thee with mine.
         
         PROTEUS	All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
         
         VALENTINE	As much to you at home! and so, farewell.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         PROTEUS	He after honour hunts, I after love:
         	He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
         	I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
         	Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
         	Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
         	War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
         	Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
         
         	[Enter SPEED]
         
         SPEED	Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
         
         PROTEUS	But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.
         
         SPEED	Twenty to one then he is shipped already,
         	And I have played the sheep in losing him.
         
         PROTEUS	Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
         	An if the shepherd be a while away.
         
         SPEED	You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,
         	and I a sheep?
         
         PROTEUS	I do.
         
         SPEED	Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
         
         PROTEUS	A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
         
         SPEED	This proves me still a sheep.
         
         PROTEUS	True; and thy master a shepherd.
         
         SPEED	Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
         
         PROTEUS	It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
         
         SPEED	The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
         	shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
         	not me: therefore I am no sheep.
         
         PROTEUS	The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
         	shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
         	wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
         	follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
         
         SPEED	Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
         
         PROTEUS	But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?
         
         SPEED	Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,
         	a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
         	lost mutton, nothing for my labour.
         
         PROTEUS	Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
         
         SPEED	If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
         
         PROTEUS	Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.
         
         SPEED	Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
         	carrying your letter.
         
         PROTEUS	You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.
         
         SPEED	From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
         	'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
         	your lover.
         
         PROTEUS	But what said she?
         
         SPEED	[First nodding]  Ay.
         
         PROTEUS	Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.
         
         SPEED	You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask
         	me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'
         
         PROTEUS	And that set together is noddy.
         
         SPEED	Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
         	take it for your pains.
         
         PROTEUS	No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
         
         SPEED	Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
         
         PROTEUS	Why sir, how do you bear with me?
         
         SPEED	Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing
         	but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
         
         PROTEUS	Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
         
         SPEED	And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
         
         PROTEUS	Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?
         
         SPEED	Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
         	be both at once delivered.
         
         PROTEUS	Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
         
         SPEED	Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
         
         PROTEUS	Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
         
         SPEED	Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,
         	not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
         	and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
         	fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
         	mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as
         	hard as steel.
         
         PROTEUS	What said she? nothing?
         
         SPEED	No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To
         	testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
         	me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
         	letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.
         
         PROTEUS	Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
         	Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
         	Being destined to a drier death on shore.
         
         	[Exit SPEED]
         
         	I must go send some better messenger:
         	I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
         	Receiving them from such a worthless post.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         
         
         
         	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The same. Garden of JULIA's house.
         
         
         	[Enter JULlA and LUCETTA]
         
         JULIA	But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
         	Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
         
         LUCETTA	Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
         
         JULIA	Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
         	That every day with parle encounter me,
         	In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
         
         LUCETTA	Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
         	According to my shallow simple skill.
         
         JULIA	What thinkest thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
         
         LUCETTA	As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
         	But, were I you, he never should be mine.
         
         JULIA	What thinkest thou of the rich Mercatio?
         
         LUCETTA	Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
         
         JULIA	What thinkest thou of the gentle Proteus?
         
         LUCETTA	Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
         
         JULIA	How now! what means this passion at his name?
         
         LUCETTA	Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
         	That I, unworthy body as I am,
         	Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
         
         JULIA	Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
         
         LUCETTA	Then thus: of many good I think him best.
         
         JULIA	Your reason?
         
         LUCETTA	I have no other, but a woman's reason;
         	I think him so because I think him so.
         
         JULIA	And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
         
         LUCETTA	Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
         
         JULIA	Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.
         
         LUCETTA	Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
         
         JULIA	His little speaking shows his love but small.
         
         LUCETTA	Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
         
         JULIA	They do not love that do not show their love.
         
         LUCETTA	O, they love least that let men know their love.
         
         JULIA	I would I knew his mind.
         
         LUCETTA	Peruse this paper, madam.
         
         JULIA	'To Julia.' Say, from whom?
         
         LUCETTA	That the contents will show.
         
         JULIA	Say, say, who gave it thee?
         
         LUCETTA	Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
         	He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
         	Did in your name receive it: pardon the
         	fault I pray.
         
         JULIA	Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
         	Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
         	To whisper and conspire against my youth?
         	Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
         	And you an officer fit for the place.
         	Or else return no more into my sight.
         
         LUCETTA	To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
         
         JULIA	Will ye be gone?
         
         LUCETTA	                  That you may ruminate.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         JULIA	And yet I would I had overlooked the letter:
         	It were a shame to call her back again
         	And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
         	What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
         	And would not force the letter to my view!
         	Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
         	Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
         	Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
         	That,  a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
         	And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
         	How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
         	When willingly I would have had her here!
         	How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
         	When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
         	My penance is to call Lucetta back
         	And ask remission for my folly past.
         	What ho! Lucetta!
         
         	[Re-enter LUCETTA]
         
         LUCETTA	                  What would your ladyship?
         
         JULIA	Is't near dinner-time?
         
         LUCETTA	I would it were,
         	That you might kill your stomach on your meat
         	And not upon your maid.
         
         JULIA	What is't that you took up so gingerly?
         
         LUCETTA	Nothing.
         
         JULIA	Why didst thou stoop, then?
         
         LUCETTA	To take a paper up that I let fall.
         
         JULIA	And is that paper nothing?
         
         LUCETTA	Nothing concerning me.
         
         JULIA	Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
         
         LUCETTA	Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
         	Unless it have a false interpeter.
         
         JULIA	Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
         
         LUCETTA	That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
         	Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
         
         JULIA	As little by such toys as may be possible.
         	Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
         
         LUCETTA	It is too heavy for so light a tune.
         
         JULIA	Heavy! be it hath some burden then?
         
         LUCETTA	Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.
         
         JULIA	And why not you?
         
         LUCETTA	                  I cannot reach so high.
         
         JULIA	Let's see your song. How now, minion!
         
         LUCETTA	Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
         	And yet methinks I do not  this tune.
         
         JULIA	You do not?
         
         LUCETTA	          No, madam; it is too sharp.
         
         JULIA	You, minion, are too saucy.
         
         LUCETTA	Nay, now you are too flat
         	And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
         	There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
         
         JULIA	The mean is drowned with your unruly bass.
         
         LUCETTA	Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
         
         JULIA	This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
         	Here is a coil with protestation!
         
         	[Tears the letter]
         
         	Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
         	You would be fingering them, to anger me.
         
         LUCETTA	She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
         	To be so angered with another letter.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         JULIA	 Nay, would I were so angered with the same!
         	O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
         	Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
         	And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
         	I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
         	Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
         	As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
         	I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
         	Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
         	And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
         	Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
         	Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly healed;
         	And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
         	But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
         	Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
         	Till I have found each letter in the letter,
         	Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
         	Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
         	And throw it thence into the raging sea!
         	Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
         	'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
         	To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
         	And yet I will not, sith so prettily
         	He couples it to his complaining names.
         	Thus will I fold them one on another:
         	Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
         
         	[Re-enter LUCETTA]
         
         LUCETTA	Madam,
         	Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
         
         JULIA	Well, let us go.
         
         LUCETTA	What, shall these papers lie  tell-tales here?
         
         JULIA	If you respect them, best to take them up.
         
         LUCETTA	Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:
         	Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
         
         JULIA	I see you have a month's mind to them.
         
         LUCETTA	Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
         	I see things too, although you judge I wink.

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	The same. ANTONIO's house.
         
         
         	[Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO]
         
         ANTONIO	Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
         	Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
         
         PANTHINO	'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
         
         ANTONIO	Why, what of him?
         
         PANTHINO	                  He wondered that your lordship
         	Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
         	While other men, of slender reputation,
         	Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
         	Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
         	Some to discover islands far away;
         	Some to the studious universities.
         	For any or for all these exercises,
         	He said that Proteus your son was meet,
         	And did request me to importune you
         	To let him spend his time no more at home,
         	Which would be great impeachment to his age,
         	In having known no travel in his youth.
         
         ANTONIO	Nor needest thou much importune me to that
         	Whereon this month I have been hammering.
         	I have considered well his loss of time
         	And how he cannot be a perfect man,
         	Not being tried and tutored in the world:
         	Experience is by industry achieved
         	And perfected by the swift course of time.
         	Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?
         
         PANTHINO	I think your lordship is not ignorant
         	How his companion, youthful Valentine,
         	Attends the emperor in his royal court.
         
         ANTONIO	I know it well.
         
         PANTHINO	'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
         	There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
         	Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.
         	And be in eye of every exercise
         	Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
         
         ANTONIO	I  thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
         	And that thou mayst perceive how well I  it,
         	The execution of it shall make known.
         	Even with the speediest expedition
         	I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
         
         PANTHINO	To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,
         	With other gentlemen of good esteem,
         	Are journeying to salute the emperor
         	And to commend their service to his will.
         
         ANTONIO	Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
         	And, in good time! now will we break with him.
         
         	[Enter PROTEUS]
         
         PROTEUS	Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
         	Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
         	Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
         	O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,
         	To seal our happiness with their consents!
         	O heavenly Julia!
         
         ANTONIO	How now! what letter are you reading there?
         
         PROTEUS	May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
         	Of commendations sent from Valentine,
         	Delivered by a friend that came from him.
         
         ANTONIO	Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
         
         PROTEUS	There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
         	How happily he lives, how well beloved
         	And daily graced by the emperor;
         	Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
         
         ANTONIO	And how stand you affected to his wish?
         
         PROTEUS	As one relying on your lordship's will
         	And not depending on his friendly wish.
         
         ANTONIO	My will is something sorted with his wish.
         	Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
         	For what I will, I will, and there an end.
         	I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
         	With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
         	What maintenance he from his friends receives,
         	 exhibition thou shalt have from me.
         	To-morrow be in readiness to go:
         	Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
         
         PROTEUS	My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
         	Please you, deliberate a day or two.
         
         ANTONIO	Look, what thou wantest shall be sent after thee:
         	No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
         	Come on, Panthino: you shall be employed
         	To hasten on his expedition.
         
         	[Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO]
         
         PROTEUS	Thus have I shunned the fire for fear of burning,
         	And drenched me in the sea, where I am drowned.
         	I feared to show my father Julia's letter,
         	Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
         	And with the vantage of mine own excuse
         	Hath he excepted most against my love.
         	O, how this spring of love resembleth
         	The uncertain glory of an April day,
         	Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
         	And by and by a cloud takes all away!
         
         	[Re-enter PANTHINO]
         
         PANTHINO	Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:
         	He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.
         
         PROTEUS	Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
         	And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'

         SCENE I	Milan. The DUKE's palace.
         
         
         	[Enter VALENTINE and SPEED]
         
         SPEED	Sir, your glove.
         
         VALENTINE	                  Not mine; my gloves are on.
         
         SPEED	Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
         
         VALENTINE	Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:
         	Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
         	Ah, Silvia, Silvia!
         
         SPEED	Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
         
         VALENTINE	How now, sirrah?
         
         SPEED	She is not within hearing, sir.
         
         VALENTINE	Why, sir, who bade you call her?
         
         SPEED	Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
         
         VALENTINE	Well, you'll still be too forward.
         
         SPEED	And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
         
         VALENTINE	Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
         
         SPEED	She that your worship loves?
         
         VALENTINE	Why, how know you that I am in love?
         
         SPEED	Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
         	learned,  Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
         	 a malecontent; to relish a love-song,  a
         	robin-redbreast; to walk alone,  one that had
         	the pestilence; to sigh,  a school-boy that had
         	lost his A B C; to weep,  a young wench that had
         	buried her grandam; to fast,  one that takes
         	diet; to watch  one that fears robbing; to
         	speak puling,  a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
         	wont, when you laughed, to crow  a cock; when you
         	walked, to walk  one of the lions; when you
         	fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
         	looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
         	are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
         	on you, I can hardly think you my master.
         
         VALENTINE	Are all these things perceived in me?
         
         SPEED	They are all perceived without ye.
         
         VALENTINE	Without me? they cannot.
         
         SPEED	Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you
         	were so simple, none else would: but you are so
         	without these follies, that these follies are within
         	you and shine through you  the water in an
         	urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
         	physician to comment on your malady.
         
         VALENTINE	But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
         
         SPEED	She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
         
         VALENTINE	Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
         
         SPEED	Why, sir, I know her not.
         
         VALENTINE	Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
         	knowest her not?
         
         SPEED	Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
         
         VALENTINE	Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
         
         SPEED	Sir, I know that well enough.
         
         VALENTINE	What dost thou know?
         
         SPEED	That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.
         
         VALENTINE	I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
         
         SPEED	That's because the one is painted and the other out
         	of all count.
         
         VALENTINE	How painted? and how out of count?
         
         SPEED	Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
         	man counts of her beauty.
         
         VALENTINE	How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
         
         SPEED	You never saw her since she was deformed.
         
         VALENTINE	How long hath she been deformed?
         
         SPEED	Ever since you loved her.
         
         VALENTINE	I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
         	see her beautiful.
         
         SPEED	If you love her, you cannot see her.
         
         VALENTINE	Why?
         
         SPEED	Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;
         	or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
         	have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
         	ungartered!
         
         VALENTINE	What should I see then?
         
         SPEED	Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
         	for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
         	hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
         
         VALENTINE	Be, boy, then, you are in love; for last
         	morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
         
         SPEED	True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,
         	you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
         	bolder to chide you for yours.
         
         VALENTINE	In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
         
         SPEED	I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
         
         VALENTINE	Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
         	one she loves.
         
         SPEED	And have you?
         
         VALENTINE	I have.
         
         SPEED	Are they not lamely writ?
         
         VALENTINE	No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!
         	here she comes.
         
         SPEED	[Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
         	Now will he interpret to her.
         
         	[Enter SILVIA]
         
         VALENTINE	Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.
         
         SPEED	[Aside]  O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.
         
         SILVIA	Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
         
         SPEED	[Aside]  He should give her interest and she gives it him.
         
         VALENTINE	As you enjoined me, I have writ your letter
         	Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
         	Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
         	But for my duty to your ladyship.
         
         SILVIA	I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
         
         VALENTINE	Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
         	For being ignorant to whom it goes
         	I writ at random, very doubtfully.
         
         SILVIA	Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
         
         VALENTINE	No, madam; so it stead you, I will write
         	Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--
         
         SILVIA	A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
         	And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
         	And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
         	Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
         
         SPEED	[Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'
         
         VALENTINE	What means your ladyship? do you not  it?
         
         SILVIA	Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
         	But since unwillingly, take them again.
         	Nay, take them.
         
         VALENTINE	Madam, they are for you.
         
         SILVIA	Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;
         	But I will none of them; they are for you;
         	I would have had them writ more movingly.
         
         VALENTINE	Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
         
         SILVIA	And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
         	And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.
         
         VALENTINE	If it please me, madam, what then?
         
         SILVIA	Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:
         	And so, good morrow, servant.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         SPEED	O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
         	As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!
         	My master sues to her, and she hath
         	taught her suitor,
         	He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
         	O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,
         	That my master, being scribe, to himself should write
         	the letter?
         
         VALENTINE	How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?
         
         SPEED	Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
         
         VALENTINE	To do what?
         
         SPEED	To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.
         
         VALENTINE	To whom?
         
         SPEED	To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.
         
         VALENTINE	What figure?
         
         SPEED	By a letter, I should say.
         
         VALENTINE	Why, she hath not writ to me?
         
         SPEED	What need she, when she hath made you write to
         	yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
         
         VALENTINE	No, believe me.
         
         SPEED	No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive
         	her earnest?
         
         VALENTINE	She gave me none, except an angry word.
         
         SPEED	Why, she hath given you a letter.
         
         VALENTINE	That's the letter I writ to her friend.
         
         SPEED	And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.
         
         VALENTINE	I would it were no worse.
         
         SPEED	I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:
         	For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
         	Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
         	Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
         	Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
         	All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.
         	Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.
         
         VALENTINE	I have dined.
         
         SPEED	Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can
         	feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my
         	victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not 
         	your mistress; be moved, be moved.

         PROTEUS	Have patience, gentle Julia.
         
         JULIA	I must, where is no remedy.
         
         PROTEUS	When possibly I can, I will return.
         
         JULIA	If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
         	Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
         
         	[Giving a ring]
         
         PROTEUS	Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.
         
         JULIA	And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
         
         PROTEUS	Here is my hand for my true constancy;
         	And when that hour overslips me in the day
         	Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
         	The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
         	Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
         	My father stays my coming; answer not;
         	The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
         	That tide will stay me longer than I should.
         	Julia, farewell!
         
         	[Exit JULIA]
         
         	What, gone without a word?
         	Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;

         	[Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog]
         
         LAUNCE	Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;
         	all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I
         	have received my proportion,  the prodigious
         	son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's
         	court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured
         	dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
         	wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat
         	wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
         	perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed
         	one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and
         	has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
         	wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,
         	having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my
         	parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This
         	shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:
         	no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
         	cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it
         	hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in
         	it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance
         	on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my
         	sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
         	as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
         	am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the
         	dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,
         	so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:
         	now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
         	now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now
         	come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now
         	 a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there
         	'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now
         	come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
         	the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
         	word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.
         
         	[Enter PANTHINO]
         
         PANTHINO	Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped
         	and thou art to post after with oars. What's the
         	matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll
         	lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.
         
         LAUNCE	It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the
         	unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
         
         PANTHINO	What's the unkindest tide?
         
         LAUNCE	Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.
         
         PANTHINO	Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in
         	losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing
         	thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy
         	master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy
         	service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?
         
         LAUNCE	For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
         
         PANTHINO	Where should I lose my tongue?
         
         LAUNCE	In thy tale.
         
         PANTHINO	In thy tail!
         
         LAUNCE	Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and
         	the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river
         	were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the
         	wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.
         
         PANTHINO	Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.
         
         LAUNCE	Sir, call me what thou darest.

         VALENTINE	Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir
         	Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,

         	What say you to a letter from your friends
         	Of much good news?
         
         VALENTINE	                  My lord, I will be thankful.
         	To any happy messenger from thence.
         
         DUKE	Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
         
         VALENTINE	Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
         	To be of worth and worthy estimation
         	And not without desert so well reputed.
         
         DUKE	Hath he not a son?
         
         VALENTINE	Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
         	The honour and regard of such a father.
         
         DUKE	You know him well?
         
         VALENTINE	I know him as myself; for from our infancy
         	We have conversed and spent our hours together:
         	And though myself have been an idle truant,
         	Omitting the sweet benefit of time
         	To clothe mine age with angel- perfection,
         	Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
         	Made use and fair advantage of his days;
         	His years but young, but his experience old;
         	His head unmellowed, but his judgment ripe;
         	And, in a word, for far behind his worth
         	Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
         	He is complete in feature and in mind
         	With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
         
         DUKE	Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
         	He is as worthy for an empress' love
         	As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
         	Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
         	With commendation from great potentates;
         	And here he means to spend his time awhile:
         	I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
         
         VALENTINE	Should I have wished a thing, it had been he.
         
         DUKE	Welcome him then according to his worth.
         	Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
         	For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:
         	I will send him hither to you presently.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         VALENTINE	This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
         	Had come along with me, but that his mistress
         	Did hold his eyes locked in her crystal looks.
         
         SILVIA	Be that now she hath enfranchised them
         	Upon some other pawn for fealty.
         
         VALENTINE	Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
         
         SILVIA	Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
         	How could he see his way to seek out you?
         
         VALENTINE	Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
         
         THURIO	They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
         
         VALENTINE	To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:
         	Upon a homely object Love can wink.

         SILVIA	His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
         	If this be he you oft have wished to hear from.
         
         VALENTINE	Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him
         	To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
         
         SILVIA	Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
         
         PROTEUS	Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant
         	To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
         
         VALENTINE	Leave off discourse of disability:
         	Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
         
         PROTEUS	My duty will I boast of; nothing else.
         
         SILVIA	And duty never yet did want his meed:
         	Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
         
         PROTEUS	I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
         
         SILVIA	That you are welcome?
         
         PROTEUS	That you are worthless.
         
         	[Re-enter THURIO]
         
         THURIO	Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
         
         SILVIA	I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
         	Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
         	I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
         	When you have done, we look to hear from you.
         
         PROTEUS	We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
         
         	[Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO]
         
         VALENTINE	Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
         
         PROTEUS	Your friends are well and have them much commended.
         
         VALENTINE	And how do yours?
         
         PROTEUS	                  I left them all in health.
         
         VALENTINE	How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
         
         PROTEUS	My tales of love were wont to weary you;
         	I know you joy not in a love discourse.
         
         VALENTINE	Ay, Proteus, but that life is altered now:
         	I have done penance for contemning Love,
         	Whose high imperious thoughts have punished me
         	With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
         	With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
         	For in revenge of my contempt of love,
         	Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
         	And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
         	O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
         	And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
         	There is no woe to his correction,
         	Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
         	Now no discourse, except it be of love;
         	Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
         	Upon the very naked name of love.
         
         PROTEUS	Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
         	Was this the idol that you worship so?
         
         VALENTINE	Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
         
         PROTEUS	No; but she is an earthly paragon.
         
         VALENTINE	Call her divine.
         
         PROTEUS	                  I will not flatter her.
         
         VALENTINE	O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.
         
         PROTEUS	When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
         	And I must minister the  to you.
         
         VALENTINE	Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
         	Yet let her be a principality,
         	Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
         
         PROTEUS	Except my mistress.
         
         VALENTINE	Sweet, except not any;
         	Except thou wilt except against my love.
         
         PROTEUS	Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
         
         VALENTINE	And I will help thee to prefer her too:
         	She shall be dignified with this high honour--
         	To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
         	Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
         	And, of so great a favour growing proud,
         	Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
         	And make rough winter everlastingly.
         
         PROTEUS	Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
         
         VALENTINE	Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing
         	To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;
         	She is alone.
         
         PROTEUS	                  Then let her alone.
         
         VALENTINE	Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
         	And I as rich in having such a jewel
         	As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
         	The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
         	Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
         	Because thou seeest me dote upon my love.
         	My foolish rival, that her father s
         	Only for his possessions are so huge,
         	Is gone with her along, and I must after,
         	For love, thou knowest, is full of jealousy.
         
         PROTEUS	But she loves you?
         
         VALENTINE	Ay, and we are betrothed: nay, more, our,
         	marriage-hour,
         	With all the cunning manner of our flight,
         	Determined of; how I must climb her window,
         	The ladder made of cords, and all the means
         	Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
         	Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
         	In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
         
         PROTEUS	Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
         	I must unto the road, to disembark
         	Some necessaries that I needs must use,
         	And then I'll presently attend you.
         
         VALENTINE	Will you make haste?
         
         PROTEUS	I will.
         
         	[Exit VALENTINE]
         
         	Even as one heat another heat expels,
         	Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
         	So the remembrance of my former love
         	Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
         	Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
         	Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
         	That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
         	She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
         	That I did love, for now my love is thawed;
         	Which,  a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,
         	Bears no impression of the thing it was.
         	Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
         	And that I love him not as I was wont.
         	O, but I love his lady too too much,
         	And that's the reason I love him so little.
         	How shall I dote on her with more advice,
         	That thus without advice begin to love her!
         	'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
         	And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
         	But when I look on her perfections,
         	There is no reason but I shall be blind.
         	If I can cheque my erring love, I will;
         	If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.

         SPEED	Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!
         
         LAUNCE	Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not
         	welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never
         	undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a
         	place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess

         	did thy master part with Madam Julia?
         
         LAUNCE	Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very
         	fairly in jest.
         
         SPEED	But shall she marry him?
         
         LAUNCE	No.
         
         SPEED	How then? shall he marry her?
         
         LAUNCE	No, neither.
         
         SPEED	What, are they broken?
         
         LAUNCE	No, they are both as whole as a fish.
         
         SPEED	Why, then, how stands the matter with them?

         	staff understands me.
         
         SPEED	What thou sayest?
         
         LAUNCE	Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,
         	and my staff understands me.
         
         SPEED	It stands under thee, indeed.
         
         LAUNCE	Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
         
         SPEED	But tell me true, will't be a match?
         
         LAUNCE	Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,
         	it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.
         
         SPEED	The conclusion is then that it will.
         
         LAUNCE	Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
         
         SPEED	'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest
         	thou, that my master is become a notable lover?
         
         LAUNCE	I never knew him otherwise.

         LAUNCE	A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
         
         SPEED	Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.
         
         LAUNCE	Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.
         
         SPEED	I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
         
         LAUNCE	Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself
         	in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;

         PROTEUS	To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
         	To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
         	To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
         	And even that power which gave me first my oath
         	Provokes me to this threefold perjury;
         	Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
         	O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
         	Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
         	At first I did adore a twinkling star,
         	But now I worship a celestial sun.
         	Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
         	And he wants wit that wants resolved will
         	To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
         	Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
         	Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferred
         	With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
         	I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
         	But there I leave to love where I should love.
         	Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
         	If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
         	If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
         	For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.
         	I to myself am dearer than a friend,
         	For love is still most precious in itself;
         	And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
         	Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
         	I will forget that Julia is alive,
         	Remembering that my love to her is dead;
         	And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
         	Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
         	I cannot now prove constant to myself,
         	Without some treachery used to Valentine.
         	This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
         	To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
         	Myself in counsel, his competitor.
         	Now presently I'll give her father notice
         	Of their disguising and pretended flight;
         	Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
         	For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
         	But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
         	By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.

         	[Enter JULIA and LUCETTA]
         
         JULIA	Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
         	And even in kind love I do conjure thee,
         	Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
         	Are visibly charactered and engraved,
         	To lesson me and tell me some good mean
         	How, with my honour, I may undertake
         	A journey to my loving Proteus.
         
         LUCETTA	Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
         
         JULIA	A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
         	To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
         	Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
         	And when the flight is made to one so dear,
         	Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
         
         LUCETTA	Better forbear till Proteus make return.
         
         JULIA	O, knowest thou not his looks are my soul's food?
         	Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
         	By longing for that food so long a time.
         	Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
         	Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
         	As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
         
         LUCETTA	I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
         	But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
         	Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
         
         JULIA	The more thou dammest it up, the more it burns.
         	The current that with gentle murmur glides,
         	Thou knowest, being stopped, impatiently doth rage;
         	But when his fair course is not hindered,
         	He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,
         	Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
         	He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
         	And so by many winding nooks he strays
         	With willing sport to the wild ocean.
         	Then let me go and hinder not my course
         	I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
         	And make a pastime of each weary step,
         	Till the last step have brought me to my love;
         	And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
         	A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
         
         LUCETTA	But in what habit will you go along?
         
         JULIA	Not  a woman; for I would prevent
         	The loose encounters of lascivious men:
         	Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
         	As may beseem some well-reputed page.
         
         LUCETTA	Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
         
         JULIA	No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
         	With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
         	To be fantastic may become a youth
         	Of greater time than I shall show to be.
         
         LUCETTA	What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?
         
         JULIA	That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
         	What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
         	Why even what fashion thou best , Lucetta.
         
         LUCETTA	You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
         
         JULIA	Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favoured.
         
         LUCETTA	A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
         	Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
         
         JULIA	Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
         	What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
         	But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
         	For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
         	I fear me, it will make me scandalized.
         
         LUCETTA	If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
         
         JULIA	Nay, that I will not.
         
         LUCETTA	Then never dream on infamy, but go.
         	If Proteus  your journey when you come,
         	No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
         	I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.
         
         JULIA	That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
         	A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
         	And instances of infinite of love
         	Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
         
         LUCETTA	All these are servants to deceitful men.
         
         JULIA	Base men, that use them to so base effect!
         	But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
         	His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
         	His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
         	His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
         	His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
         
         LUCETTA	Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!
         
         JULIA	Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
         	To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
         	Only deserve my love by loving him;
         	And presently go with me to my chamber,
         	To take a note of what I stand in need of,
         	To furnish me upon my longing journey.
         	All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
         	My goods, my lands, my reputation;
         	Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
         	Come, answer not, but to it presently!

         	[Exit THURIO]
         
         	Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
         
         PROTEUS	My gracious lord, that which I would discover
         	The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
         	But when I call to mind your gracious favours
         	Done to me, undeserving as I am,
         	My duty pricks me on to utter that
         	Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
         	Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
         	This night intends to steal away your daughter:
         	Myself am one made privy to the plot.
         	I know you have determined to bestow her
         	On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
         	And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
         	It would be much vexation to your age.
         	Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
         	To cross my friend in his intended drift
         	Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
         	A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
         	Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
         
         DUKE	Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
         	Which to requite, command me while I live.
         	This love of theirs myself have often seen,
         	Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
         	And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
         	Sir Valentine her company and my court:
         	But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
         	And so unworthily disgrace the man,
         	A rashness that I ever yet have shunned,
         	I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
         	That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
         	And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
         	Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
         	I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
         	The key whereof myself have ever kept;
         	And thence she cannot be conveyed away.
         
         PROTEUS	Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
         	How he her chamber-window will ascend
         	And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
         	For which the youthful lover now is gone
         	And this way comes he with it presently;
         	Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
         	But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly
         	That my discovery be not aimed at;
         	For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
         	Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
         
         DUKE	Upon mine honour, he shall never know
         	That I had any light from thee of this.
         
         PROTEUS	Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.

         DUKE	Be they of much import?
         
         VALENTINE	The tenor of them doth but signify
         	My health and happy being at your court.
         
         DUKE	Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
         	I am to break with thee of some affairs
         	That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
         	'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
         	To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
         
         VALENTINE	I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
         	Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
         	Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities
         	Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
         	Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
         
         DUKE	No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
         	Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
         	Neither regarding that she is my child
         	Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
         	And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
         	Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
         	And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
         	Should have been cherished by her child- duty,
         	I now am full resolved to take a wife
         	And turn her out to who will take her in:
         	Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
         	For me and my possessions she esteems not.
         
         VALENTINE	What would your Grace have me to do in this?
         
         DUKE	There is a lady in Verona here
         	Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
         	And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
         	Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
         	For long agone I have forgot to court;
         	Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
         	How and which way I may bestow myself
         	To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
         
         VALENTINE	Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
         	Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
         	More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
         
         DUKE	But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
         
         VALENTINE	A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
         	Send her another; never give her over;
         	For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
         	If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
         	But rather to beget more love in you:
         	If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
         	For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
         	Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
         	For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
         	Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
         	Though never so black, say they have angels' faces.
         	That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
         	If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
         
         DUKE	But she I mean is promised by her friends
         	Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
         	And kept severely from resort of men,
         	That no man hath access by day to her.
         
         VALENTINE	Why, then, I would resort to her by night.
         
         DUKE	Ay, but the doors be locked and keys kept safe,
         	That no man hath recourse to her by night.
         
         VALENTINE	What lets but one may enter at her window?
         
         DUKE	Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
         	And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
         	Without apparent hazard of his life.
         
         VALENTINE	Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
         	To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
         	Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
         	So bold Leander would adventure it.
         
         DUKE	Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
         	Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
         
         VALENTINE	When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
         
         DUKE	This very night; for Love is  a child,
         	That longs for every thing that he can come by.
         
         VALENTINE	By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
         
         DUKE	But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
         	How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
         
         VALENTINE	It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
         	Under a cloak that is of any length.
         
         DUKE	A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
         
         VALENTINE	Ay, my good lord.
         
         DUKE	                  Then let me see thy cloak:
         	I'll get me one of such another length.
         
         VALENTINE	Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
         
         DUKE	How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
         	I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
         	What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
         	And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
         	I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
         	And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
         	O, could their master come and go as lightly,
         	Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
         	My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
         	While I, their king, that hither them importune,
         	Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blessed them,
         	Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
         	I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
         	That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
         	What's here?
         	'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
         	'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
         	Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--
         	Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
         	And with thy daring folly burn the world?
         	Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
         	Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
         	Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
         	And think my patience, more than thy desert,
         	Is privilege for thy departure hence:
         	Thank me for this more than for all the favours
         	Which all too much I have bestowed on thee.
         	But if thou linger in my territories
         	Longer than swiftest expedition
         	Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
         	By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
         	I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
         	Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
         	But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         VALENTINE	And why not death rather than living torment?
         	To die is to be banished from myself;
         	And Silvia is myself: banished from her
         	Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
         	What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
         	What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
         	Unless it be to think that she is by
         	And feed upon the shadow of perfection
         	Except I be by Silvia in the night,
         	There is no music in the nightingale;
         	Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
         	There is no day for me to look upon;
         	She is my essence, and I leave to be,
         	If I be not by her fair influence
         	Fostered, illumined, cherished, kept alive.
         	I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
         	Tarry I here, I but attend on death:
         	But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.

         	So much of bad already hath possessed them.
         
         PROTEUS	Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
         	For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.

         	From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.
         
         VALENTINE	O, I have fed upon this woe already,
         	And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
         	Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
         
         PROTEUS	Ay, ay; and she hath offered to the doom--
         	Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--
         	A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:
         	Those at her father's churlish feet she tendered;
         	With them, upon her knees, her humble self;
         	Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
         	As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
         	But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
         	Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
         	Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
         	But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
         	Besides, her intercession chafed him so,
         	When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
         	That to close prison he commanded her,
         	With many bitter threats of biding there.
         
         VALENTINE	No more; unless the next word that thou speakest

         	And study help for that which thou lamentest.
         	Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
         	Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
         	Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
         	Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
         	And manage it against despairing thoughts.

         	for thee at the North-gate.
         
         SPEED	For me?
         
         LAUNCE	For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for a
         	better man than thee.
         
         SPEED	And must I go to him?
         
         LAUNCE	Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long
         	that going will scarce serve the turn.
         
         SPEED	Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         LAUNCE	Now will he be swinged for reading my letter; an
         	unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into
         	secrets! I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction.

         	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The same. The DUKE's palace.
         
         
         	[Enter DUKE and THURIO]
         
         DUKE	Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
         	Now Valentine is banished from her sight.
         
         THURIO	Since his exile she hath despised me most,
         	Forsworn my company and railed at me,
         	That I am desperate of obtaining her.
         
         DUKE	This weak impress of love is as a figure
         	Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
         	Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
         	A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
         	And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
         
         	[Enter PROTEUS]
         
         	How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
         	According to our proclamation gone?
         
         PROTEUS	Gone, my good lord.
         
         DUKE	My daughter takes his going grievously.
         
         PROTEUS	A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
         
         DUKE	So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
         	Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
         	For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
         	Makes me the better to confer with thee.
         
         PROTEUS	Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
         	Let me not live to look upon your grace.
         
         DUKE	Thou knowest how willingly I would effect
         	The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
         
         PROTEUS	I do, my lord.
         
         DUKE	And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
         	How she opposes her against my will
         
         PROTEUS	She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
         
         DUKE	Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
         	What might we do to make the girl forget
         	The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?
         
         PROTEUS	The best way is to slander Valentine
         	With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,
         	Three things that women highly hold in hate.
         
         DUKE	Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
         
         PROTEUS	Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
         	Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
         	By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
         
         DUKE	Then you must undertake to slander him.
         
         PROTEUS	And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
         	'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
         	Especially against his very friend.
         
         DUKE	Where your good word cannot advantage him,
         	Your slander never can endamage him;
         	Therefore the office is indifferent,
         	Being entreated to it by your friend.
         
         PROTEUS	You have prevailed, my lord; if I can do it
         	By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,
         	She shall not long continue love to him.
         	But say this weed her love from Valentine,
         	It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
         
         THURIO	Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
         	Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
         	You must provide to bottom it on me;
         	Which must be done by praising me as much
         	As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
         
         DUKE	And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
         	Because we know, on Valentine's report,
         	You are already Love's firm votary
         	And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
         	Upon this warrant shall you have access
         	Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
         	For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
         	And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
         	Where you may temper her by your persuasion
         	To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
         
         PROTEUS	As much as I can do, I will effect:
         	But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
         	You must lay lime to tangle her desires
         	By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
         	Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
         
         DUKE	Ay,
         	Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
         
         PROTEUS	Say that upon the altar of her beauty
         	You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:
         	Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
         	Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
         	That may discover such integrity:
         	For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
         	Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
         	Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
         	Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
         	After your dire-lamenting elegies,
         	Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
         	With some sweet concert; to their instruments
         	Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
         	Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
         	This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
         
         DUKE	This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
         
         THURIO	And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
         	Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
         	Let us into the city presently
         	To sort some gentlemen well skilled in music.
         	I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
         	To give the onset to thy good advice.
         
         DUKE	About it, gentlemen!
         
         PROTEUS	We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,
         	And afterward determine our proceedings.
         
         DUKE	Even now about it! I will pardon you.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE I	The frontiers of Mantua. A forest.
         
         
         	[Enter certain Outlaws]
         
         First Outlaw	Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
         
         Second Outlaw	If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
         
         	[Enter VALENTINE and SPEED]
         
         Third Outlaw	Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:
         	If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.
         
         SPEED	Sir, we are undone; these are the villains
         	That all the travellers do fear so much.
         
         VALENTINE	My friends,--
         
         First Outlaw	That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.
         
         Second Outlaw	Peace! we'll hear him.
         
         Third Outlaw	Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.
         
         VALENTINE	Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
         	A man I am crossed with adversity;
         	My riches are these poor habiliments,
         	Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
         	You take the sum and substance that I have.
         
         Second Outlaw	Whither travel you?
         
         VALENTINE	To Verona.
         
         First Outlaw	Whence came you?
         
         VALENTINE	From Milan.
         
         Third Outlaw	Have you long sojourned there?
         
         VALENTINE	Some sixteen months, and longer might have stayed,
         	If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
         
         First Outlaw	What, were you banished thence?
         
         VALENTINE	I was.
         
         Second Outlaw	For what offence?
         
         VALENTINE	For that which now torments me to rehearse:
         	I killed a man, whose death I much repent;
         	But yet I slew him manfully in fight,
         	Without false vantage or base treachery.
         
         First Outlaw	Why, never repent it, if it were done so.
         	But were you banished for so small a fault?
         
         VALENTINE	I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
         
         Second Outlaw	Have you the tongues?
         
         VALENTINE	My youthful travel therein made me happy,
         	Or else I often had been miserable.
         
         Third Outlaw	By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
         	This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
         
         First Outlaw	We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
         
         SPEED	Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.
         
         VALENTINE	Peace, villain!
         
         Second Outlaw	Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
         
         VALENTINE	Nothing but my fortune.
         
         Third Outlaw	Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
         	Such as the fury of ungoverned youth
         	Thrust from the company of awful men:
         	Myself was from Verona banished
         	For practising to steal away a lady,
         	An heir, and near allied unto the duke.
         
         Second Outlaw	And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
         	Who, in my mood, I stabbed unto the heart.
         
         First Outlaw	And I for such  petty crimes as these,
         	But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,
         	That they may hold excused our lawless lives;
         	And partly, seeing you are beautified
         	With goodly shape and by your own report
         	A linguist and a man of such perfection
         	As we do in our quality much want--
         
         Second Outlaw	Indeed, because you are a banished man,
         	Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
         	Are you content to be our general?
         	To make a virtue of necessity
         	And live, as we do, in this wilderness?
         
         Third Outlaw	What sayest thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
         	Say ay, and be the captain of us all:
         	We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
         	Love thee as our commander and our king.
         
         First Outlaw	But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.
         
         Second Outlaw	Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offered.
         
         VALENTINE	I take your offer and will live with you,
         	Provided that you do no outrages
         	On silly women or poor passengers.
         
         Third Outlaw	No, we detest such vile base practises.
         	Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,
         	And show thee all the treasure we have got,
         	Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber.
         
         
         	[Enter PROTEUS]
         
         PROTEUS	Already have I been false to Valentine
         	And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
         	Under the colour of commending him,
         	I have access my own love to prefer:
         	But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
         	To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
         	When I protest true loyalty to her,
         	She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
         	When to her beauty I commend my vows,
         	She bids me think how I have been forsworn
         	In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
         	And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
         	The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
         	Yet, spaniel-, the more she spurns my love,
         	The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
         	But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
         	And give some evening music to her ear.
         
         	[Enter THURIO and Musicians]
         
         THURIO	How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
         
         PROTEUS	Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love
         	Will creep in service where it cannot go.
         
         THURIO	Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
         
         PROTEUS	Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.
         
         THURIO	Who? Silvia?
         
         PROTEUS	                  Ay, Silvia; for your sake.
         
         THURIO	I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
         	Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
         
         	[Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes]
         
         Host	Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I
         	pray you, why is it?
         
         JULIA	Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
         
         Host	Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where
         	you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.
         
         JULIA	But shall I hear him speak?
         
         Host	Ay, that you shall.
         
         JULIA	That will be music.
         
         	[Music plays]
         
         Host	Hark, hark!
         
         JULIA	Is he among these?
         
         Host	Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.
         
         	SONG.
         	Who is Silvia? what is she,
         	That all our swains commend her?
         	Holy, fair and wise is she;
         	The heaven such grace did lend her,
         	That she might admired be.
         
         	Is she kind as she is fair?
         	For beauty lives with kindness.
         	Love doth to her eyes repair,
         	To help him of his blindness,
         	And, being helped, inhabits there.
         
         	Then to Silvia let us sing,
         	That Silvia is excelling;
         	She excels each mortal thing
         	Upon the dull earth dwelling:
         	To her let us garlands bring.
         
         Host	How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
         	do you, man? the music s you not.
         
         JULIA	You mistake; the musician s me not.
         
         Host	Why, my pretty youth?
         
         JULIA	He plays false, father.
         
         Host	How? out of tune on the strings?
         
         JULIA	Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
         	heart-strings.
         
         Host	You have a quick ear.
         
         JULIA	Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.
         
         Host	I perceive you delight not in music.
         
         JULIA	Not a whit, when it jars so.
         
         Host	Hark, what fine change is in the music!
         
         JULIA	Ay, that change is the spite.
         
         Host	You would have them always play but one thing?
         
         JULIA	I would always have one play but one thing.
         	But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
         	Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
         
         Host	I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved
         	her out of all nick.
         
         JULIA	Where is Launce?
         
         Host	Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his
         	master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
         
         JULIA	Peace! stand aside: the company parts.
         
         PROTEUS	Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead
         	That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
         
         THURIO	Where meet we?
         
         PROTEUS	                  At Saint Gregory's well.
         
         THURIO	Farewell.
         
         	[Exeunt THURIO and Musicians]
         
         	[Enter SILVIA above]
         
         PROTEUS	Madam, good even to your ladyship.
         
         SILVIA	I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
         	Who is that that spake?
         
         PROTEUS	One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
         	You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
         
         SILVIA	Sir Proteus, as I take it.
         
         PROTEUS	Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
         
         SILVIA	What's your will?
         
         PROTEUS	                  That I may compass yours.
         
         SILVIA	You have your wish; my will is even this:
         	That presently you hie you home to bed.
         	Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!
         	Thinkest thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
         	To be seduced by thy flattery,
         	That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
         	Return, return, and make thy love amends.
         	For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
         	I am so far from granting thy request
         	That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
         	And by and by intend to chide myself
         	Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
         
         PROTEUS	I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
         	But she is dead.
         
         JULIA	[Aside]        'Twere false, if I should speak it;
         	For I am sure she is not buried.
         
         SILVIA	Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
         	Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,
         	I am betrothed: and art thou not ashamed
         	To wrong him with thy importunacy?
         
         PROTEUS	I wise hear that Valentine is dead.
         
         SILVIA	And so suppose am I; for in his grave
         	Assure thyself my love is buried.
         
         PROTEUS	Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
         
         SILVIA	Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
         	Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
         
         JULIA	[Aside]  He heard not that.
         
         PROTEUS	Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
         	Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
         	The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
         	To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:
         	For since the substance of your perfect self
         	Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
         	And to your shadow will I make true love.
         
         JULIA	[Aside]  If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,
         	deceive it,
         	And make it but a shadow, as I am.
         
         SILVIA	I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
         	But since your falsehood shall become you well
         	To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
         	Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:
         	And so, good rest.
         
         PROTEUS	                  As wretches have overnight
         	That wait for execution in the morn.
         
         	[Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally]
         
         JULIA	Host, will you go?
         
         Host	By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
         
         JULIA	Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
         
         Host	Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost
         	day.
         
         JULIA	Not so; but it hath been the longest night
         	That ever I watched and the most heaviest.

         	[Enter EGLAMOUR]
         
         EGLAMOUR	This is the hour that Madam Silvia
         	Entreated me to call and know her mind:
         	There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
         	Madam, madam!
         
         	[Enter SILVIA above]
         
         SILVIA	                  Who calls?
         
         EGLAMOUR	Your servant and your friend;
         	One that attends your ladyship's command.
         
         SILVIA	Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.
         
         EGLAMOUR	As many, worthy lady, to yourself:
         	According to your ladyship's impose,
         	I am thus early come to know what service
         	It is your pleasure to command me in.
         
         SILVIA	O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--
         	Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--
         	Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplished:
         	Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
         	I bear unto the banished Valentine,
         	Nor how my father would enforce me marry
         	Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
         	Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say
         	No grief did ever come so near thy heart
         	As when thy lady and thy true love died,
         	Upon whose grave thou vowedst pure chastity.
         	Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
         	To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
         	And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
         	I do desire thy worthy company,
         	Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
         	Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
         	But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
         	And on the justice of my flying hence,
         	To keep me from a most unholy match,
         	Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
         	I do desire thee, even from a heart
         	As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
         	To bear me company and go with me:
         	If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
         	That I may venture to depart alone.
         
         EGLAMOUR	Madam, I pity much your grievances;
         	Which since I know they virtuously are placed,
         	I give consent to go along with you,
         	Recking as little what betideth me
         	As much I wish all good befortune you.
         	When will you go?
         
         SILVIA	                  This evening coming.
         
         EGLAMOUR	Where shall I meet you?
         
         SILVIA	At Friar Patrick's cell,
         	Where I intend holy confession.
         
         EGLAMOUR	I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The same.
         
         
         	[Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog]
         
         LAUNCE	When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,
         	look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
         	puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
         	four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
         	I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
         	'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
         	him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
         	and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
         	steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
         	O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
         	in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
         	one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
         	as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
         	more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
         	I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
         	live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
         	thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
         	gentleman dogs under the duke's table: he had
         	not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
         	all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
         	one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
         	out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
         	I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
         	knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
         	whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
         	the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
         	the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you
         	wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
         	of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
         	his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
         	stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
         	been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
         	he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
         	Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
         	trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
         	Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
         	do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
         	water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
         	thou ever see me do such a trick?
         
         	[Enter PROTEUS and JULIA]
         
         PROTEUS	Sebastian is thy name? I  thee well
         	And will employ thee in some service presently.
         
         JULIA	In what you please: I'll do what I can.
         
         PROTEUS	I hope thou wilt.
         
         	[To LAUNCE]
         
         	How now, you whoreson peasant!
         	Where have you been these two days loitering?
         
         LAUNCE	Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
         
         PROTEUS	And what says she to my little jewel?
         
         LAUNCE	Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you
         	currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
         
         PROTEUS	But she received my dog?
         
         LAUNCE	No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him
         	back again.
         
         PROTEUS	What, didst thou offer her this from me?
         
         LAUNCE	Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by
         	the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
         	offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
         	yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
         
         PROTEUS	Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
         	Or never return again into my sight.
         	Away, I say! stayest thou to vex me here?
         
         	[Exit LAUNCE]
         
         	A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
         	Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
         	Partly that I have need of such a youth
         	That can with some discretion do my business,
         	For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
         	But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,
         	Which, if my augury deceive me not,
         	Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:
         	Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
         	Go presently and take this ring with thee,
         	Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
         	She loved me well delivered it to me.
         
         JULIA	It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
         	She is dead, be?
         
         PROTEUS	Not so; I think she lives.
         
         JULIA	Alas!
         
         PROTEUS	Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
         
         JULIA	I cannot choose
         	But pity her.
         
         PROTEUS	                  Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
         
         JULIA	Because methinks that she loved you as well
         	As you do love your lady Silvia:
         	She dreams of him that has forgot her love;
         	You dote on her that cares not for your love.
         	'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
         	And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
         
         PROTEUS	Well, give her that ring and therewithal
         	This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
         	I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
         	Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
         	Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         JULIA	How many women would do such a message?
         	Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertained
         	A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
         	Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
         	That with his very heart despiseth me?
         	Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
         	Because I love him I must pity him.
         	This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
         	To bind him to remember my good will;
         	And now am I, unhappy messenger,
         	To plead for that which I would not obtain,
         	To carry that which I would have refused,
         	To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
         	I am my master's true-confirmed love;
         	But cannot be true servant to my master,
         	Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
         	Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
         	As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
         
         	[Enter SILVIA, attended]
         
         	Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
         	To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
         
         SILVIA	What would you with her, if that I be she?
         
         JULIA	If you be she, I do entreat your patience
         	To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
         
         SILVIA	From whom?
         
         JULIA	From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
         
         SILVIA	O, he sends you for a picture.
         
         JULIA	Ay, madam.
         
         SILVIA	Ursula, bring my picture here.
         	Go give your master this: tell him from me,
         	One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
         	Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
         
         JULIA	Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
         	Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised
         	Delivered you a paper that I should not:
         	This is the letter to your ladyship.
         
         SILVIA	I pray thee, let me look on that again.
         
         JULIA	It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
         
         SILVIA	There, hold!
         	I will not look upon your master's lines:
         	I know they are stuffed with protestations
         	And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
         	As easily as I do tear his paper.
         
         JULIA	Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
         
         SILVIA	The more shame for him that he sends it me;
         	For I have heard him say a thousand times
         	His Julia gave it him at his departure.
         	Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
         	Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
         
         JULIA	She thanks you.
         
         SILVIA	What sayest thou?
         
         JULIA	I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
         	Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
         
         SILVIA	Dost thou know her?
         
         JULIA	Almost as well as I do know myself:
         	To think upon her woes I do protest
         	That I have wept a hundred several times.
         
         SILVIA	Be she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
         
         JULIA	I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
         
         SILVIA	Is she not passing fair?
         
         JULIA	She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
         	When she did think my master loved her well,
         	She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
         	But since she did neglect her looking-glass
         	And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
         	The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
         	And pinched the lily-tincture of her face,
         	That now she is become as black as I.
         
         SILVIA	How tall was she?
         
         JULIA	About my stature; for at Pentecost,
         	When all our pageants of delight were played,
         	Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
         	And I was trimmed in Madam Julia's gown,
         	Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
         	As if the garment had been made for me:
         	Therefore I know she is about my height.
         	And at that time I made her weep agood,
         	For I did play a lamentable part:
         	Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
         	For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
         	Which I so lively acted with my tears
         	That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
         	Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
         	If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
         
         SILVIA	She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
         	Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
         	I weep myself to think upon thy words.
         	Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
         	For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
         	Farewell.
         
         	[Exit SILVIA, with attendants]
         
         JULIA	And she shall thank you for't, if ever you know her.
         	A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful
         	I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
         	Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
         	Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
         	Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
         	If I had such a tire, this face of mine
         	Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
         	And yet the painter flattered her a little,
         	Unless I flatter with myself too much.
         	Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
         	If that be all the difference in his love,
         	I'll get me such a coloured periwig.
         	Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
         	Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
         	What should it be that he respects in her
         	But I can make respective in myself,
         	If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
         	Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,
         	For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
         	Thou shalt be worshipped, kissed, loved and adored!
         	And, were there sense in his idolatry,
         	My substance should be statue in thy stead.
         	I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
         	That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
         	I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes
         	To make my master out of love with thee!

         	[Enter EGLAMOUR]
         
         EGLAMOUR	The sun begins to gild the western sky;
         	And now it is about the very hour
         	That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.
         	She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
         	Unless it be to come before their time;
         	So much they spur their expedition.
         	See where she comes.
         
         	[Enter SILVIA]
         
         		Lady, a happy evening!
         
         SILVIA	Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
         	Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
         	I fear I am attended by some spies.
         
         EGLAMOUR	Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
         	If we recover that, we are sure enough.

         	[Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA]
         
         THURIO	Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
         
         PROTEUS	O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
         	And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
         
         THURIO	What, that my leg is too long?
         
         PROTEUS	No; that it is too little.
         
         THURIO	I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.
         
         JULIA	[Aside]  But love will not be spurred to what
         	it loathes.
         
         THURIO	What says she to my face?
         
         PROTEUS	She says it is a fair one.
         
         THURIO	Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
         
         PROTEUS	But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
         	Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
         
         JULIA	[Aside]  'Tis true; such pearls as put out
         	ladies' eyes;
         	For I had rather wink than look on them.
         
         THURIO	How s she my discourse?
         
         PROTEUS	Ill, when you talk of war.
         
         THURIO	But well, when I discourse of love and peace?
         
         JULIA	[Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
         
         THURIO	What says she to my valour?
         
         PROTEUS	O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
         
         JULIA	[Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
         
         THURIO	What says she to my birth?
         
         PROTEUS	That you are well derived.
         
         JULIA	[Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
         
         THURIO	Considers she my possessions?
         
         PROTEUS	O, ay; and pities them.
         
         THURIO	Wherefore?
         
         JULIA	[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
         
         PROTEUS	That they are out by lease.
         
         JULIA	Here comes the duke.
         
         	[Enter DUKE]
         
         DUKE	How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
         	Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
         
         THURIO	Not I.
         
         PROTEUS	     Nor I.
         
         DUKE	          Saw you my daughter?
         
         PROTEUS	Neither.
         
         DUKE	Why then,
         	She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
         	And Eglamour is in her company.
         	'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
         	As he in penance wandered through the forest;
         	Him he knew well, and guessed that it was she,
         	But, being masked, he was not sure of it;
         	Besides, she did intend confession
         	At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
         	These lihoods confirm her flight from hence.
         	Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
         	But mount you presently and meet with me
         	Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
         	That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:
         	Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         THURIO	Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
         	That flies her fortune when it follows her.
         	I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
         	Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         PROTEUS	And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
         	Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         JULIA	And I will follow, more to cross that love
         	Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.

         SILVIA	A thousand more mischances than this one
         	Have learned me how to brook this patiently.
         
         Second Outlaw	Come, bring her away.
         
         First Outlaw	Where is the gentleman that was with her?
         
         Third Outlaw	Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
         	But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
         	Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
         	There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;
         	The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.
         
         First Outlaw	Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
         	Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
         	And will not use a woman lawlessly.

         SCENE 	Another part of the forest.
         
         
         	[Enter VALENTINE]
         
         VALENTINE	How use doth breed a habit in a man!
         	This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
         	I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
         	Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
         	And to the nightingale's complaining notes
         	Tune my distresses and record my woes.
         	O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
         	Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
         	Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
         	And leave no memory of what it was!
         	Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
         	Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
         	What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
         	These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
         	Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
         	They love me well; yet I have much to do
         	To keep them from uncivil outrages.
         	Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?
         
         	[Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA]
         
         PROTEUS	Madam, this service I have done for you,
         	Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
         	To hazard life and rescue you from him
         	That would have forced your honour and your love;
         	Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
         	A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
         	And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.
         
         VALENTINE	[Aside]  How  a dream is this I see and hear!
         	Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
         
         SILVIA	O miserable, unhappy that I am!
         
         PROTEUS	Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
         	But by my coming I have made you happy.
         
         SILVIA	By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
         
         JULIA	[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
         
         SILVIA	Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
         	I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
         	Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
         	O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
         	Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
         	And full as much, for more there cannot be,
         	I do detest false perjured Proteus.
         	Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.
         
         PROTEUS	What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
         	Would I not undergo for one calm look!
         	O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
         	When women cannot love where they're beloved!
         
         SILVIA	When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
         	Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
         	For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
         	Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
         	Descended into perjury, to love me.
         	Thou hast no faith left now, unless thouedst two;
         	And that's far worse than none; better have none
         	Than plural faith which is too much by one:
         	Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
         
         PROTEUS	In love
         	Who respects friend?
         
         SILVIA	All men but Proteus.
         
         PROTEUS	Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
         	Can no way change you to a milder form,
         	I'll woo you  a soldier, at arms' end,
         	And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.
         
         SILVIA	O heaven!
         
         PROTEUS	        I'll force thee yield to my desire.
         
         VALENTINE	Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
         	Thou friend of an ill fashion!
         
         PROTEUS	Valentine!
         
         VALENTINE	Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
         	For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
         	Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
         	Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
         	I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
         	Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
         	Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
         	I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
         	But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
         	The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
         	'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
         
         PROTEUS	My shame and guilt confounds me.
         	Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
         	Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
         	I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
         	As ever I did commit.
         
         VALENTINE	Then I am paid;
         	And once again I do receive thee honest.
         	Who by repentance is not satisfied
         	Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
         	By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
         	And, that my love may appear plain and free,
         	All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
         
         JULIA	O me unhappy!
         
         	[Swoons]
         
         PROTEUS	Look to the boy.
         
         VALENTINE	Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?
         	Look up; speak.
         
         JULIA	O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring
         	to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.
         
         PROTEUS	Where is that ring, boy?
         
         JULIA	Here 'tis; this is it.
         
         PROTEUS	How! let me see:
         	Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
         
         JULIA	O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
         	This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
         
         PROTEUS	But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
         	I gave this unto Julia.
         
         JULIA	And Julia herself did give it me;
         	And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
         
         PROTEUS	How! Julia!
         
         JULIA	Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
         	And entertained 'em deeply in her heart.
         	How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
         	O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
         	Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
         	Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
         	In a disguise of love:
         	It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
         	Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
         
         PROTEUS	Than men their minds! 'tis true.
         	O heaven! were man
         	But constant, he were perfect. That one error
         	Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
         	Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
         	What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
         	More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
         
         VALENTINE	Come, come, a hand from either:
         	Let me be blest to make this happy close;
         	'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
         
         PROTEUS	Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.
         
         JULIA	And I mine.

         VALENTINE	Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
         	Come not within the measure of my wrath;
         	Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
         	Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
         	Take but possession of her with a touch:
         	I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
         
         THURIO	Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
         	I hold him but a fool that will endanger
         	His body for a girl that loves him not:
         	I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
         
         DUKE	The more degenerate and base art thou,
         	To make such means for her as thou hast done
         	And leave her on such slight conditions.
         	Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
         	I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
         	And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
         	Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
         	Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
         	Plead a new state in thy unrivalled merit,
         	To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
         	Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
         	Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.
         
         VALENTINE	I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.
         	I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
         	To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.
         
         DUKE	I grant it, for thine own, whatever it be.
         
         VALENTINE	These banished men that I have kept withal
         	Are men endued with worthy qualities:
         	Forgive them what they have committed here
         	And let them be recalled from their exile:
         	They are reformed, civil, full of good
         	And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
         
         DUKE	Thou hast prevailed; I pardon them and thee:
         	Dispose of them as thou knowest their deserts.
         	Come, let us go: we will include all jars
         	With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.
         
         VALENTINE	And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
         	With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
         	What think you of this page, my lord?
         
         DUKE	I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
         
         VALENTINE	I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
         
         DUKE	What mean you by that saying?
         
         VALENTINE	Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
         	That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
         	Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
         	The story of your loves discovered:
         	That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
         	One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Rome. Before the Capitol.
         
         
         	[The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes
         	and Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one side,
         	SATURNINUS and his Followers; and, from the other
         	side, BASSIANUS and his Followers; with drum and colours]
         
         SATURNINUS	Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
         	Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
         	And, countrymen, my loving followers,
         	Plead my successive title with your swords:
         	I am his first-born son, that was the last
         	That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
         	Then let my father's honours live in me,
         	Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
         
         BASSIANUS	Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,
         	If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,
         	Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
         	Keep then this passage to the Capitol
         	And suffer not dishonour to approach
         	The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
         	To justice, continence and nobility;
         	But let desert in pure election shine,
         	And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
         
         	[Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown]
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
         	Ambitiously for rule and empery,
         	Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
         	A special party, have, by common voice,
         	In election for the Roman empery,
         	Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
         	For many good and great deserts to Rome:
         	A nobler man, a braver warrior,
         	Lives not this day within the city walls:
         	He by the senate is accited home
         	From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;
         	That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,
         	Hath yoked a nation strong, trained up in arms.
         	Ten years are spent since first he undertook
         	This cause of Rome and chastised with arms
         	Our enemies' pride: five times he hath returned
         	Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
         	In coffins from the field;
         	And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,
         	Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
         	Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
         	Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
         	Whom worthily you would have now succeed.
         	And in the Capitol and senate's right,
         	Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
         	That you withdraw you and abate your strength;
         	Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,
         	Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
         
         SATURNINUS	How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
         
         BASSIANUS	Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally
         	In thy uprightness and integrity,
         	And so I love and honour thee and thine,
         	Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
         	And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
         	Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
         	That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
         	And to my fortunes and the people's favor
         	Commit my cause in balance to be weighed.
         
         	[Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS]
         
         SATURNINUS	Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
         	I thank you all and here dismiss you all,
         	And to the love and favor of my country
         	Commit myself, my person and the cause.
         
         	[Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS]
         
         	Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
         	As I am confident and kind to thee.
         	Open the gates, and let me in.
         
         BASSIANUS	Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
         
         	[Flourish. SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol]
         
         	[Enter a Captain]
         
         Captain	Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.
         	Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
         	Successful in the battles that he fights,
         	With honour and with fortune is returned
         	From where he circumscribed with his sword,
         	And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.
         
         	[Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and
         	MUTIUS; After them, two Men bearing a coffin
         	covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After
         	them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with
         	ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths,
         	prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The
         	Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
         	Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
         	Returns with precious jading to the bay
         	From whence at first she weighed her anchorage,
         	Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
         	To re-salute his country with his tears,
         	Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
         	Thou great defender of this Capitol,
         	Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
         	Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
         	Half of the number that King Priam had,
         	Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
         	These that survive let Rome reward with love;
         	These that I bring unto their latest home,
         	With burial amongst their ancestors:
         	Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
         	Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
         	Why sufferest thou thy sons, unburied yet,
         	To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
         	Make way to lay them by their brethren.
         
         	[The tomb is opened]
         
         	There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
         	And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
         	O sacred receptacle of my joys,
         	Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
         	How many sons of mine hast thou in store,
         	That thou wilt never render to me more!
         
         LUCIUS	Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
         	That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
         	Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,
         	Before this earthy prison of their bones;
         	That so the shadows be not unappeased,
         	Nor we disturbed with prodigies on earth.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	I give him you, the noblest that survives,
         	The eldest son of this distressed queen.
         
         TAMORA	Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,
         	Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
         	A mother's tears in passion for her son:
         	And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
         	O, think my son to be as dear to me!
         	Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
         	To beautify thy triumphs and return,
         	Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,
         	But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets,
         	For valiant doings in their country's cause?
         	O, if to fight for king and commonweal
         	Were piety in thine, it is in these.
         	Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:
         	Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
         	Draw near them then in being merciful:
         	Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
         	Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
         	These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld
         	Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
         	Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
         	To this your son is marked, and die he must,
         	To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
         
         LUCIUS	Away with him! and make a fire straight;
         	And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
         	Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.
         
         	[Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS]
         
         TAMORA	O cruel, irreligious piety!
         
         CHIRON	Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?
         
         DEMETRIUS	Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
         	Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive
         	To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.
         	Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal
         	The self-same gods that armed the Queen of Troy
         	With opportunity of sharp revenge
         	Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,
         	May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths--
         	When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--
         	To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
         
         	[Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with
         	their swords bloody]
         
         LUCIUS	See, lord and father, how we have performed
         	Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopped,
         	And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
         	Whose smoke,  incense, doth perfume the sky.
         	Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,
         	And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Let it be so; and let Andronicus
         	Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
         
         	[Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb]
         
         	In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
         	Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
         	Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
         	Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
         	Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,
         	No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
         	In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!
         
         	[Enter LAVINIA]
         
         LAVINIA	In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
         	My noble lord and father, live in fame!
         	Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
         	I render, for my brethren's obsequies;
         	And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,
         	Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:
         	O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,
         	Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved
         	The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
         	Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
         	And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!
         
         	[Enter, below, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes;
         	re-enter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS, attended]
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
         	Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
         	You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!
         	Fair lords, your fortunes are a in all,
         	That in your country's service drew your swords:
         	But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,
         	That hath aspired to Solon's happiness
         	And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
         	Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
         	Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
         	Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
         	This palliament of white and spotless hue;
         	And name thee in election for the empire,
         	With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:
         	Be candidatus then, and put it on,
         	And help to set a head on headless Rome.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	A better head her glorious body fits
         	Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:
         	What should I don this robe, and trouble you?
         	Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
         	To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
         	And set abroad new business for you all?
         	Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
         	And led my country's strength successfully,
         	And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
         	Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
         	In right and service of their noble country
         	Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
         	But not a sceptre to control the world:
         	Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
         
         SATURNINUS	Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Patience, Prince Saturninus.
         
         SATURNINUS	Romans, do me right:
         	Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not
         	Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
         	Andronicus, would thou wert shipped to hell,
         	Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
         
         LUCIUS	Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
         	That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee
         	The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
         
         BASSIANUS	Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
         	But honour thee, and will do till I die:
         	My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
         	I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
         	Of noble minds is honourable meed.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,
         	I ask your voices and your suffrages:
         	Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
         
         Tribunes	To gratify the good Andronicus,
         	And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
         	The people will accept whom he admits.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,
         	That you create your emperor's eldest son,
         	Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
         	Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
         	And ripen justice in this commonweal:
         	Then, if you will elect by my advice,
         	Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	With voices and applause of every sort,
         	Patricians and plebeians, we create
         	Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,
         	And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
         
         	[A long flourish till they come down]
         
         SATURNINUS	Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done
         	To us in our election this day,
         	I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
         	And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
         	And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
         	Thy name and honourable family,
         	Lavinia will I make my empress,
         	Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
         	And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:
         	Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match
         	I hold me highly honoured of your grace:
         	And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,
         	King and commander of our commonweal,
         	The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate
         	My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;
         	Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:
         	Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
         	Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.
         
         SATURNINUS	Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
         	How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
         	Rome shall record, and when I do forget
         	The least of these unspeakable deserts,
         	Romans, forget your fealty to me.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	[To TAMORA]  Now, madam, are you prisoner to
         	an emperor;
         	To him that, for your honour and your state,
         	Will use you nobly and your followers.
         
         SATURNINUS	A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
         	That I would choose, were I to choose anew.
         	Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:
         	Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
         	Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:
         	Princely shall be thy usage every way.
         	Rest on my word, and let not discontent
         	Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you
         	Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
         	Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?
         
         LAVINIA	Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
         	Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
         
         SATURNINUS	Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;
         	Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:
         	Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.
         
         	[Flourish. SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show]
         
         BASSIANUS	Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
         
         	[Seizing LAVINIA]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?
         
         BASSIANUS	Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal
         	To do myself this reason and this right.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:
         	This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
         
         LUCIUS	And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?
         	Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
         
         SATURNINUS	Surprised! by whom?
         
         BASSIANUS	By him that justly may
         	Bear his betrothed from all the world away.
         
         	[Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA]
         
         MUTIUS	Brothers, help to convey her hence away,
         	And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
         
         	[Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
         
         MUTIUS	My lord, you pass not here.
         
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	What, villain boy!
         	Barrest me my way in Rome?
         
         	[Stabbing MUTIUS]
         
         MUTIUS	Help, Lucius, help!
         
         	[Dies]
         
         	[During the fray, SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS,
         	CHIRON and AARON go out and re-enter, above]
         
         	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
         
         LUCIUS	My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so,
         	In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;
         	My sons would never so dishonour me:
         	Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.
         
         LUCIUS	Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
         	That is another's lawful promised love.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         SATURNINUS	No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,
         	Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
         	I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;
         	Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
         	Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
         	Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,
         	But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
         	Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,
         	That saidest I begged the empire at thy hands.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?
         
         SATURNINUS	But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
         	To him that flourished for her with his sword
         	A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
         	One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
         	To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	These words are razors to my wounded heart.
         
         SATURNINUS	And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,
         	That  the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs
         	Dost overshine the gallantest dames of Rome,
         	If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,
         	Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,
         	And will create thee empress of Rome,
         	Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
         	And here I swear by all the Roman gods,
         	Sith priest and holy water are so near
         	And tapers burn so bright and every thing
         	In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,
         	I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
         	Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
         	I lead espoused my bride along with me.
         
         TAMORA	And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,
         	If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,
         	She will a handmaid be to his desires,
         	A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
         
         SATURNINUS	Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany
         	Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,
         	Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,
         	Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:
         	There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
         
         	[Exeunt all but TITUS]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
         	Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
         	Dishonoured thus, and challenged of wrongs?
         
         	[Re-enter MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS]
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
         	In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,
         	Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
         	That hath dishonoured all our family;
         	Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!
         
         LUCIUS	But let us give him burial, as becomes;
         	Give Mutius burial with our brethren.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:
         	This monument five hundred years hath stood,
         	Which I have sumptuously re-edified:
         	Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
         	Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
         	Bury him where you can; he comes not here.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My lord, this is impiety in you:
         	My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him
         	He must be buried with his brethren.
         
         QUINTUS	|
         	| And shall, or him we will accompany.
         MARTIUS	|
         
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	'And shall!' what villain was it that spake
         	that word?
         
         QUINTUS	He that would vouch it in any place but here.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	What, would you bury him in my despite?
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
         	To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
         	And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:
         	My foes I do repute you every one;
         	So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.
         
         MARTIUS	He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
         
         QUINTUS	Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
         
         	[MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel]
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--
         
         QUINTUS	Father, and in that name doth nature speak,--
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,--
         
         LUCIUS	Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
         	His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
         	That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
         	Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:
         	The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
         	That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son
         	Did graciously plead for his funerals:
         	Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy
         	Be barred his entrance here.
         
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Rise, Marcus, rise.
         	The dismallest day is this that ever I saw,
         	To be dishonoured by my sons in Rome!
         	Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
         
         	[MUTIUS is put into the tomb]
         
         LUCIUS	There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
         	Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
         
         All	[Kneeling]  No man shed tears for noble Mutius;
         	He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,
         	How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
         	Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,
         	Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell:
         	Is she not then beholding to the man
         	That brought her for this high good turn so far?
         	Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
         
         	[Flourish. Re-enter, from one side, SATURNINUS
         	attended, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON; from
         	the other, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, and others]
         
         SATURNINUS	So, Bassianus, you have played your prize:
         	God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!
         
         BASSIANUS	And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,
         	Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.
         
         SATURNINUS	Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
         	Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
         
         BASSIANUS	Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
         	My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?
         	But let the laws of Rome determine all;
         	Meanwhile I am possessed of that is mine.
         
         SATURNINUS	'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;
         	But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.
         
         BASSIANUS	My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
         	Answer I must and shall do with my life.
         	Only thus much I give your grace to know:
         	By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
         	This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,
         	Is in opinion and in honour wronged;
         	That in the rescue of Lavinia
         	With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
         	In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
         	To be controlled in that he frankly gave:
         	Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,
         	That hath expressed himself in all his deeds
         	A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
         	'Tis thou and those that have dishonoured me.
         	Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
         	How I have loved and honoured Saturnine!
         
         TAMORA	My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
         	Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
         	Then hear me speak in indifferently for all;
         	And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
         
         SATURNINUS	What, madam! be dishonoured openly,
         	And basely put it up without revenge?
         
         TAMORA	Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend
         	I should be author to dishonour you!
         	But on mine honour dare I undertake
         	For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;
         	Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:
         	Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;
         	Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
         	Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
         	[Aside to SATURNINUS]  My lord, be ruled by me,
         	be won at last;
         	Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
         	You are but newly planted in your throne;
         	Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,
         	Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,
         	And so supplant you for ingratitude,
         	Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,
         	Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:
         	I'll find a day to massacre them all
         	And raze their faction and their family,
         	The cruel father and his traitorous sons,
         	To whom I sued for my dear son's life,
         	And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
         	Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.
         
         	[Aloud]
         
         	Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;
         	Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
         	That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.
         
         SATURNINUS	Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevailed.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:
         	These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.
         
         TAMORA	Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
         	A Roman now adopted happily,
         	And must advise the emperor for his good.
         	This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;
         	And let it be mine honour, good my lord,
         	That I have reconciled your friends and you.
         	For you, Prince Bassianus, I have passed
         	My word and promise to the emperor,
         	That you will be more mild and tractable.
         	And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia;
         	By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
         	You shall ask pardon of his majesty.
         
         LUCIUS	We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness,
         	That what we did was mildly as we might,
         	Tendering our sister's honour and our own.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	That, on mine honour, here I do protest.
         
         SATURNINUS	Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.
         
         TAMORA	Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:
         	The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;
         	I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.
         
         SATURNINUS	Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,
         	And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
         	I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.
         	Lavinia, though you left me  a churl,
         	I found a friend, and sure as death I swore
         	I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
         	Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,
         	You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
         	This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	To-morrow, an it please your majesty
         	To hunt the panther and the hart with me,
         	With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.

         SCENE I	Rome. Before the Palace.
         
         
         	[Enter AARON]
         
         AARON	Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
         	Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
         	Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;
         	Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.
         	As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
         	And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
         	Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,
         	And overlooks the highest-peering hills;
         	So Tamora:
         	Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
         	And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
         	Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,
         	To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
         	And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long
         	Hast prisoner held, fettered in amorous chains
         	And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
         	Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
         	Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
         	I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,
         	To wait upon this new-made empress.
         	To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,
         	This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
         	This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
         	And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
         	Holloa! what storm is this?
         
         	[Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, braving]
         
         DEMETRIUS	Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,
         	And manners, to intrude where I am graced;
         	And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.
         
         CHIRON	Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;
         	And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
         	'Tis not the difference of a year or two
         	Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
         	I am as able and as fit as thou
         	To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;
         	And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
         	And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
         
         AARON	[Aside]  Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep
         	the peace.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,
         	Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
         	Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?
         	Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
         	Till you know better how to handle it.
         
         CHIRON	Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
         	Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?
         
         	[They draw]
         
         AARON	[Coming forward]  Why, how now, lords!
         	So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,
         	And maintain such a quarrel openly?
         	Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
         	I would not for a million of gold
         	The cause were known to them it most concerns;
         	Nor would your noble mother for much more
         	Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome.
         	For shame, put up.
         
         DEMETRIUS	                  Not I, till I have sheathed
         	My rapier in his bosom and withal
         	Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
         	That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.
         
         CHIRON	For that I am prepared and full resolved.
         	Foul-spoken coward, that thunderest with thy tongue,
         	And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!
         
         AARON	Away, I say!
         	Now, by the gods that war Goths adore,
         	This petty brabble will undo us all.
         	Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
         	It is to jet upon a prince's right?
         	What, is Lavinia then become so loose,
         	Or Bassianus so degenerate,
         	That for her love such quarrels may be broached
         	Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
         	Young lords, beware! and should the empress know
         	This discord's ground, the music would not please.
         
         CHIRON	I care not, I, knew she and all the world:
         	I love Lavinia more than all the world.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
         	Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
         
         AARON	Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome
         	How furious and impatient they be,
         	And cannot brook competitors in love?
         	I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
         	By this device.
         
         CHIRON	                  Aaron, a thousand deaths
         	Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
         
         AARON	To achieve her! how?
         
         DEMETRIUS	Why makest thou it so strange?
         	She is a woman, therefore may be wooed;
         	She is a woman, therefore may be won;
         	She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
         	What, man! more water glideth by the mill
         	Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
         	Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:
         	Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.
         	Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
         
         AARON	[Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Then why should he despair that knows to court it
         	With words, fair looks and liberality?
         	What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,
         	And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
         
         AARON	Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so
         	Would serve your turns.
         
         CHIRON	Ay, so the turn were served.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Aaron, thou hast hit it.
         
         AARON	Would you had hit it too!
         	Then should not we be tired with this ado.
         	Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools
         	To square for this? would it offend you, then
         	That both should speed?
         
         CHIRON	Faith, not me.
         
         DEMETRIUS	                  Nor me, so I were one.
         
         AARON	For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:
         	'Tis policy and stratagem must do
         	That you affect; and so must you resolve,
         	That what you cannot as you would achieve,
         	You must perforce accomplish as you may.
         	Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
         	Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
         	A speedier course than lingering languishment
         	Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
         	My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
         	There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
         	The forest walks are wide and spacious;
         	And many unfrequented plots there are
         	Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
         	Single you thither then this dainty doe,
         	And strike her home by force, if not by words:
         	This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
         	Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit
         	To villany and vengeance consecrate,
         	Will we acquaint with all that we intend;
         	And she shall file our engines with advice,
         	That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
         	But to your wishes' height advance you both.
         	The emperor's court is  the house of Fame,
         	The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:
         	The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
         	There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take
         	your turns;
         	There serve your lusts, shadowed from heaven's eye,
         	And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
         
         CHIRON	Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,
         
         DEMETRIUS	Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
         	To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.

         TITUS ANDRONICUS	The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,
         	The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:
         	Uncouple here and let us make a bay
         	And wake the emperor and his lovely bride
         	And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,
         	That all the court may echo with the noise.
         	Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
         	To attend the emperor's person carefully:
         	I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
         	But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.

         	Many good morrows to your majesty;
         	Madam, to you as many and as good:
         	I promised your grace a hunter's peal.
         
         SATURNINUS	And you have rung it lustily, my lord;
         	Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.
         
         BASSIANUS	Lavinia, how say you?
         
         LAVINIA	I say, no;
         	I have been broad awake two hours and more.
         
         SATURNINUS	Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,
         	And to our sport.
         
         	[To TAMORA]
         
         	Madam, now shall ye see
         	Our Roman hunting.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	                  I have dogs, my lord,
         	Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
         	And climb the highest promontory top.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	And I have horse will follow where the game
         	Makes way, and run  swallows over the plain.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
         	But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.

         	[Enter AARON, with a bag of gold]
         
         AARON	He that had wit would think that I had none,
         	To bury so much gold under a tree,
         	And never after to inherit it.
         	Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
         	Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,
         	Which, cunningly effected, will beget
         	A very excellent piece of villany:
         	And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
         
         	[Hides the gold]
         
         	That have their alms out of the empress' chest.
         
         	[Enter TAMORA]
         
         TAMORA	My lovely Aaron, wherefore lookest thou sad,
         	When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
         	The birds chant melody on every bush,
         	The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,
         	The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
         	And make a chequered shadow on the ground:
         	Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
         	And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
         	Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,
         	As if a double hunt were heard at once,
         	Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
         	And, after conflict such as was supposed
         	The wandering prince and Dido once enjoyed,
         	When with a happy storm they were surprised
         	And curtained with a counsel-keeping cave,
         	We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,
         	Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;
         	Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
         	Be unto us as is a nurse's song
         	Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
         
         AARON	Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
         	Saturn is dominator over mine:
         	What signifies my deadly-standing eye,
         	My silence and my cloudy melancholy,
         	My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
         	Even as an adder when she doth unroll
         	To do some fatal execution?
         	No, madam, these are no venereal signs:
         	Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
         	Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
         	Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,
         	Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,
         	This is the day of doom for Bassianus:
         	His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
         	Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
         	And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
         	Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,
         	And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.
         	Now question me no more; we are espied;
         	Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
         	Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
         
         TAMORA	Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!
         
         AARON	No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:
         	Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons
         	To back thy quarrels, whatsoever they be.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         	[Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA]
         
         BASSIANUS	Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,
         	Unfurnished of her well-beseeming troop?
         	Or is it Dian, habited  her,
         	Who hath abandoned her holy groves
         	To see the general hunting in this forest?
         
         TAMORA	Saucy controller of our private steps!
         	Had I the power that some say Dian had,
         	Thy temples should be planted presently
         	With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds
         	Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
         	Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
         
         LAVINIA	Under your patience, gentle empress,
         	'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;
         	And to be doubted that your Moor and you
         	Are singled forth to try experiments:
         	Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
         	'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
         
         BASSIANUS	Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian
         	Doth make your honour of his body's hue,
         	Spotted, detested, and abominable.
         	Why are you sequestered from all your train,
         	Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
         	And wandered hither to an obscure plot,
         	Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
         	If foul desire had not conducted you?
         
         LAVINIA	And, being intercepted in your sport,
         	Great reason that my noble lord be rated
         	For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,
         	And let her joy her raven-coloured love;
         	This valley fits the purpose passing well.
         
         BASSIANUS	The king my brother shall have note of this.
         
         LAVINIA	Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:
         	Good king, to be so mightily abused!
         
         TAMORA	Why have I patience to endure all this?
         
         	[Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON]
         
         DEMETRIUS	How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
         	Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
         
         TAMORA	Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
         	These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:
         	A barren detested vale, you see it is;
         	The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
         	Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe:
         	Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
         	Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:
         	And when they showed me this abhorred pit,
         	They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
         	A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
         	Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
         	Would make such fearful and confused cries
         	As any mortal body hearing it
         	Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.
         	No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
         	But straight they told me they would bind me here
         	Unto the body of a dismal yew,
         	And leave me to this miserable death:
         	And then they called me foul adulteress,
         	Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
         	That ever ear did hear to such effect:
         	And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,
         	This vengeance on me had they executed.
         	Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
         	Or be ye not henceforth called my children.
         
         DEMETRIUS	This is a witness that I am thy son.
         
         	[Stabs BASSIANUS]
         
         CHIRON	And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
         
         	[Also stabs BASSIANUS, who dies]
         
         LAVINIA	Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,
         	For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
         
         TAMORA	Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys
         	Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;
         	First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:
         	This minion stood upon her chastity,
         	Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
         	And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:
         	And shall she carry this unto her grave?
         
         CHIRON	An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
         	Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
         	And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
         
         TAMORA	But when ye have the honey ye desire,
         	Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
         
         CHIRON	I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.
         	Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
         	That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
         
         LAVINIA	O Tamora! thou bearest a woman's face,--
         
         TAMORA	I will not hear her speak; away with her!
         
         LAVINIA	Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
         	To see her tears; but be your heart to them
         	As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
         
         LAVINIA	When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
         	O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;
         	The milk thou suckedst from her did turn to marble;
         	Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
         	Yet every mother breeds not sons a:
         
         	[To CHIRON]
         
         	Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.
         
         CHIRON	What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
         
         LAVINIA	'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:
         	Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
         	The lion moved with pity did endure
         	To have his princely paws pared all away:
         	Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
         	The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
         	O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
         	Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!
         
         TAMORA	I know not what it means; away with her!
         
         LAVINIA	O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
         	That gave thee life, when well he might have
         	slain thee,
         	Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.
         
         TAMORA	Hadst thou in person never offended me,
         	Even for his sake am I pitiless.
         	Remember, boys, I poured forth tears in vain,
         	To save your brother from the sacrifice;
         	But fierce Andronicus would not relent;
         	Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,
         	The worse to her, the better loved of me.
         
         LAVINIA	O Tamora, be called a gentle queen,
         	And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
         	For 'tis not life that I have begged so long;
         	Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
         
         TAMORA	What beggest thou, then? fond woman, let me go.
         
         LAVINIA	'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more
         	That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
         	O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
         	And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
         	Where never man's eye may behold my body:
         	Do this, and be a charitable murderer.
         
         TAMORA	So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:
         	No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Away! for thou hast stayed us here too long.
         
         LAVINIA	No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!
         	The blot and enemy to our general name!
         	Confusion fall--
         
         CHIRON	Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:
         	This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
         
         	[DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the
         	pit; then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging
         	off LAVINIA]
         
         TAMORA	Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.
         	never let my heart know merry cheer indeed,
         	Till all the Andronici be made away.
         	Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
         	And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         	[Re-enter AARON, with QUINTUS and MARTIUS]
         
         AARON	Come on, my lords, the better foot before:
         	Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
         	Where I espied the panther fast asleep.
         
         QUINTUS	My sight is very dull, whatever it bodes.
         
         MARTIUS	And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,
         	Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
         
         	[Falls into the pit]
         
         QUINTUS	What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,
         	Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers,
         	Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
         	As fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers?
         	A very fatal place it seems to me.
         
         	Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?
         
         MARTIUS	O brother, with the dismallest object hurt
         	That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
         
         AARON	[Aside]  Now will I fetch the king to find them here,
         	That he thereby may give a ly guess
         	How these were they that made away his brother.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         MARTIUS	Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
         	From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?
         
         QUINTUS	I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
         	A chilling sweat over-runs my trembling joints:
         	My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
         
         MARTIUS	To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,
         	Aaron and thou look down into this den,
         	And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
         
         QUINTUS	Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart
         	Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
         	The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;
         	O, tell me how it is; for never till now
         	Was I a child to fear I know not what.
         
         MARTIUS	Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,
         	All on a heap,  to a slaughtered lamb,
         	In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.
         
         QUINTUS	If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
         
         MARTIUS	Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
         	A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,
         	Which,  a taper in some monument,
         	Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
         	And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:
         	So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
         	When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
         	O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--
         	If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--
         	Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
         	As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
         
         QUINTUS	Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
         	Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
         	I may be plucked into the swallowing womb
         	Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
         	I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
         
         MARTIUS	Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
         
         QUINTUS	Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
         	Till thou art here aloft, or I below:
         	Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.

         SATURNINUS	Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,
         	And what he is that now is leaped into it.
         	Say who art thou that lately didst descend
         	Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
         
         MARTIUS	The unhappy son of old Andronicus:
         	Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
         	To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
         
         SATURNINUS	My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
         	He and his lady both are at the lodge
         	Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
         	'Tis not an hour since I left him there.
         
         MARTIUS	We know not where you left him all alive;
         	But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.

         TAMORA	Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
         	The complot of this timeless tragedy;
         	And wonder greatly that man's face can fold

         	O Tamora! was ever heard the ?
         	This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.
         	Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
         	That should have murdered Bassianus here.
         
         AARON	My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.

         TAMORA	What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
         	How easily murder is discovered!
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	High emperor, upon my feeble knee
         	I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,

         	Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--
         
         SATURNINUS	If it be proved! you see it is apparent.
         	Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?
         
         TAMORA	Andronicus himself did take it up.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;
         	For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow
         	They shall be ready at your highness' will
         	To answer their suspicion with their lives.
         
         SATURNINUS	Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
         	Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers:
         	Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;
         	For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
         	That end upon them should be executed.

         	Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravished thee.

         MARCUS	Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast!
         	Cousin, a word; where is your husband?
         	If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
         	If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
         	That I may slumber in eternal sleep!
         	Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
         	Have lopped and hewed and made thy body bare
         	Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,
         	Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
         	And might not gain so great a happiness
         	As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
         	Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
         	 to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind,
         	Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
         	Coming and going with thy honey breath.
         	But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
         	And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
         	Ah, now thou turnest away thy face for shame!
         	And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
         	As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,
         	Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
         	Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.
         	Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?
         	O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
         	That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!
         	Sorrow concealed,  an oven stopped,
         	Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
         	Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,
         	And in a tedious sampler sewed her mind:
         	But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;
         	A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
         	And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,
         	That could have better sewed than Philomel.
         	O, had the monster seen those lily hands
         	Tremble,  aspen-leaves, upon a lute,
         	And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
         	He would not then have touched them for his life!
         	Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony
         	Which that sweet tongue hath made,
         	He would have dropped his knife, and fell asleep
         	As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
         	Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;
         	For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
         	One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
         	What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?

         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!
         	For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
         	In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;
         	For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;
         	For all the frosty nights that I have watched;
         	And for these bitter tears, which now you see
         	Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;
         	Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
         	Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
         	For two and twenty sons I never wept,
         	Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
         
         	[Lieth down; the Judges, &amp;c., pass by him, and Exeunt]
         
         	For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write
         	My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:
         	Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
         	My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
         	O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,
         	That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
         	Than youthful April shall with all his showers:
         	In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
         	In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
         	And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
         	So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
         
         	[Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn]

         	Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;
         	And let me say, that never wept before,
         	My tears are now prevailing orators.
         
         LUCIUS	O noble father, you lament in vain:
         	The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;
         	And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.
         	Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--
         
         LUCIUS	My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,
         	They would not mark me, or if they did mark,
         	They would not pity me, yet plead I must;
         	And bootless unto them [                  ]
         	Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
         	Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
         	Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,
         	For that they will not intercept my tale:
         	When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
         	Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
         	And, were they but attired in grave weeds,
         	Rome could afford no tribune  to these.
         	A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones;
         	A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
         	And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.

         	For which attempt the judges have pronounced
         	My everlasting doom of banishment.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	O happy man! they have befriended thee.
         	Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
         	That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
         	Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
         	But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,
         	From these devourers to be banished!
         	But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
         
         	[Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA]

         	Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:

         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Will it consume me? let me see it, then.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	This was thy daughter.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, Marcus, so she is.
         
         LUCIUS	Ay me, this object kills me!
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
         	Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
         	Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
         	What fool hath added water to the sea,
         	Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
         	My grief was at the height before thou camest,
         	And now  Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
         	Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;
         	For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
         	And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;
         	In bootless prayer have they been held up,
         	And they have served me to effectless use:
         	Now all the service I require of them
         	Is that the one will help to cut the other.
         	'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
         	For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.
         
         LUCIUS	Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyred thee?
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
         	That blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence,
         	Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,
         	Where,  a sweet melodious bird, it sung
         	Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!
         
         LUCIUS	O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, thus I found her, straying in the park,
         	Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer
         	That hath received some unrecuring wound.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	It was my deer; and he that wounded her
         	Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:
         	For now I stand as one upon a rock
         	Environed with a wilderness of sea,
         	Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
         	Expecting ever when some envious surge
         	Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
         	This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
         	Here stands my other son, a banished man,
         	And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
         	But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,
         	Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
         	Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
         	It would have madded me: what shall I do
         	Now I behold thy lively body so?
         	Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:
         	Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyred thee:
         	Thy husband he is dead: and for his death
         	Thy brothers are condemned, and dead by this.
         	Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!
         	When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
         	Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
         	Upon a gathered lily almost withered.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Perchance she weeps because they killed her husband;
         	Perchance because she knows them innocent.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful
         	Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
         	No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
         	Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
         	Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
         	Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
         	Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,
         	And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,
         	Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
         	How they are stained, as meadows, yet not dry,
         	With miry slime left on them by a flood?
         	And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
         	Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
         	And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
         	Or shall we cut away our hands,  thine?
         	Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
         	Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
         	What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,
         	Plot some deuce of further misery,
         	To make us wondered at in time to come.
         
         LUCIUS	Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,
         	See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot
         	Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
         	For thou, poor man, hast drowned it with thine own.
         
         LUCIUS	Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:
         	Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
         	That to her brother which I said to thee:
         	His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
         	Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
         	O, what a sympathy of woe is this,
         	As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
         
         	[Enter AARON]
         
         AARON	Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor
         	Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,
         	Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
         	Or any one of you, chop off your hand,
         	And send it to the king: he for the same
         	Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;
         	And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
         	Did ever raven sing so  a lark,
         	That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
         	With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:
         	Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?
         
         LUCIUS	Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
         	That hath thrown down so many enemies,
         	Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:
         	My youth can better spare my blood than you;
         	And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	 Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,
         	And reared aloft the bloody battle-axe,
         	Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
         	O, none of both but are of high desert:
         	My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
         	To ransom my two nephews from their death;
         	Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
         
         AARON	Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
         	For fear they die before their pardon come.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My hand shall go.
         
         LUCIUS	                  By heaven, it shall not go!
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Sirs, strive no more: such withered herbs as these
         	Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
         
         LUCIUS	Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
         	Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	And, for our father's sake and mother's care,
         	Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
         
         LUCIUS	Then I'll go fetch an axe.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	But I will use the axe.
         
         	[Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:
         	Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
         
         AARON	[Aside]  If that be called deceit, I will be honest,
         	And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:
         	But I'll deceive you in another sort,
         	And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass.
         
         	[Cuts off TITUS's hand]
         
         	[Re-enter LUCIUS and MARCUS]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatched.
         	Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:
         	Tell him it was a hand that warded him
         	From thousand dangers; bid him bury it
         	More hath it merited; that let it have.
         	As for my sons, say I account of them
         	As jewels purchased at an easy price;
         	And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.
         
         AARON	I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand
         	Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany
         	Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
         	Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
         	Aaron will have his soul black  his face.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
         	And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:
         	If any power pities wretched tears,
         	To that I call!
         
         	[To LAVINIA]
         	What, wilt thou kneel with me?
         	Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;
         	Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,
         	And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
         	When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O brother, speak with possibilities,
         	And do not break into these deep extremes.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
         	Then be my passions bottomless with them.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	But yet let reason govern thy lament.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	If there were reason for these miseries,
         	Then into limits could I bind my woes:
         	When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth overflow?
         	If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
         	Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?
         	And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
         	I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!
         	She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
         	Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
         	Then must my earth with her continual tears
         	Become a deluge, overflowed and drowned;
         	For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
         	But  a drunkard must I vomit them.
         	Then give me leave, for losers will have leave
         	To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
         
         	[Enter a Messenger, with two heads and a hand]
         
         Messenger	Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
         	For that good hand thou sentest the emperor.
         	Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
         	And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;
         	Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mocked;
         	That woe is me to think upon thy woes
         	More than remembrance of my father's death.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily,
         	And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
         	These miseries are more than may be borne.
         	To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;
         	But sorrow flouted at is double death.
         
         LUCIUS	Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
         	And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
         	That ever death should let life bear his name,
         	Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!
         
         	[LAVINIA kisses TITUS]
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
         	As frozen water to a starved snake.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	When will this fearful slumber have an end?
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus;
         	Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads,
         	Thy war hand, thy mangled daughter here:
         	Thy other banished son, with this dear sight
         	Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,
         	Even  a stony image, cold and numb.
         	Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:
         	Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand
         	Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight
         	The closing up of our most wretched eyes;
         	Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ha, ha, ha!
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, I have not another tear to shed:
         	Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
         	And would usurp upon my watery eyes
         	And make them blind with tributary tears:
         	Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
         	For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
         	And threat me I shall never come to bliss
         	Till all these mischiefs be returned again
         	Even in their throats that have committed them.
         	Come, let me see what task I have to do.
         	You heavy people, circle me about,
         	That I may turn me to each one of you,
         	And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
         	The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;
         	And in this hand the other I will bear.
         	Lavinia, thou shalt be employed: these arms!
         	Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
         	As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;
         	Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:
         	Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:
         	And, if you love me, as I think you do,
         	Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.

         	Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,

         	Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;
         	O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
         	But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
         	But in oblivion and hateful griefs.

         	And make proud Saturnine and his empress

         SCENE 	A room in Titus's house. A banquet set out.
         
         
         	[Enter TITUS, MARCUS, LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS, a boy]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more
         	Than will preserve just so much strength in us
         	As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
         	Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:
         	Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,
         	And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
         	With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
         	Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;
         	Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,
         	Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
         	Then thus I thump it down.
         
         	[To LAVINIA]
         
         	Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!
         	When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,
         	Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
         	Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;
         	Or get some little knife between thy teeth,
         	And just against thy heart make thou a hole;
         	That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
         	May run into that sink, and soaking in
         	Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay
         	Such violent hands upon her tender life.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?
         	Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
         	What violent hands can she lay on her life?
         	Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;
         	To bid AEneas tell the tale twice over,
         	How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
         	O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
         	Lest we remember still that we have none.
         	Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
         	As if we should forget we had no hands,
         	If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
         	Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
         	Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
         	I can interpret all her martyred signs;
         	She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
         	Brewed with her sorrow, meshed upon her cheeks:
         	Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
         	In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
         	As begging hermits in their holy prayers:
         	Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
         	Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
         	But I of these will wrest an alphabet
         	And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.
         
         Young LUCIUS	Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:
         	Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
         	Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
         	And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
         
         	[MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife]
         
         	What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	At that that I have killed, my lord; a fly.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Out on thee, murderer! thou killest my heart;
         	Mine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny:
         	A deed of death done on the innocent
         	Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:
         	I see thou art not for my company.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, my lord, I have but killed a fly.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	But how, if that fly had a father and mother?
         	How would he hang his slender gilded wings,
         	And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
         	Poor harmless fly,
         	That, with his pretty buzzing melody,
         	Came here to make us merry! and thou hast
         	killed him.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favored fly,
         	 to the empress' Moor; therefore I killed him.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	O, O, O,
         	Then pardon me for reprehending thee,
         	For thou hast done a charitable deed.
         	Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;
         	Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor
         	Come hither purposely to poison me.--
         	There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.
         	Ah, sirrah!
         	Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,
         	But that between us we can kill a fly
         	That comes in ness of a coal-black Moor.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
         	He takes false shadows for true substances.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:
         	I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee
         	Sad stories chanced in the times of old.
         	Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
         	And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Rome. Titus's garden.
         
         
         	[Enter young LUCIUS, and LAVINIA running after him,
         	and the boy flies from her, with books under his
         	arm. Then enter TITUS and MARCUS]
         
         Young LUCIUS	Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
         	Follows me every where, I know not why:
         	Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
         	Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
         
         Young LUCIUS	Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:
         	See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:
         	Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
         	Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care
         	Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
         	Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
         
         Young LUCIUS	My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
         	Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:
         	For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,
         	Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
         	And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
         	Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
         	Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
         	Loves me as dear as ever my mother did,
         	And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:
         	Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--
         	Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:
         	And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
         	I will most willingly attend your ladyship.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Lucius, I will.
         
         	[LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which
         	LUCIUS has let fall]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
         	Some book there is that she desires to see.
         	Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.
         	But thou art deeper read, and better skilled
         	Come, and take choice of all my library,
         	And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
         	Reveal the damned contriver of this deed.
         	Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	I think she means that there was more than one
         	Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;
         	Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
         
         Young LUCIUS	Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
         	My mother gave it me.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	For love of her that's gone,
         	Perhaps she culled it from among the rest.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!
         
         	[Helping her]
         
         	What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?
         	This is the tragic tale of Philomel,
         	And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:
         	And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
         	Ravished and wronged, as Philomela was,
         	Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!
         	Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--
         	O, had we never, never hunted there!--
         	Patterned by that the poet here describes,
         	By nature made for murders and for rapes.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, why should nature build so foul a den,
         	Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none
         	but friends,
         	What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:
         	Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
         	That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.
         	Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,
         	Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
         	My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:
         	This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst
         	This after me, when I have writ my name
         	Without the help of any hand at all.
         
         	[He writes his name with his staff, and guides it
         	with feet and mouth]
         
         	Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
         	Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,
         	What God will have discovered for revenge;
         	Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
         	That we may know the traitors and the truth!
         
         	[She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it
         	with her stumps, and writes]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?
         	estuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora
         	Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Magni Dominator poli,
         	Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know
         	There is enough written upon this earth
         	To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
         	And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
         	My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;
         	And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
         	And swear with me, as, with the woful fere
         	And father of that chaste dishonoured dame,
         	Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,
         	That we will prosecute by good advice
         	Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,
         	And see their blood, or die with this reproach.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.
         	But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:
         	The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,
         	She's with the lion deeply still in league,
         	And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,
         	And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
         	You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;
         	And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
         	And with a gad of steel will write these words,
         	And lay it by: the angry northern wind
         	Will blow these sands,  Sibyl's leaves, abroad,
         	And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?
         
         Young LUCIUS	I say, my lord, that if I were a man,
         	Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe
         	For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft
         	For his ungrateful country done the .
         
         Young LUCIUS	And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, go with me into mine armoury;
         	Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
         	Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons
         	Presents that I intend to send them both:
         	Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?
         
         Young LUCIUS	Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
         	Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:
         	Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:
         	Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.
         
         	[Exeunt TITUS, LAVINIA, and Young LUCIUS]
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,
         	And not relent, or not compassion him?
         	Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,
         	That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
         	Than foemen's marks upon his battered shield;
         	But yet so just that he will not revenge.
         	Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The same. A room in the palace.
         
         
         	[Enter, from one side, AARON, DEMETRIUS, and
         	CHIRON; from the other side, Young LUCIUS, and an
         	Attendant, with a bundle of weapons, and verses
         	writ upon them]
         
         CHIRON	Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
         	He hath some message to deliver us.
         
         AARON	Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
         
         Young LUCIUS	My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
         	I greet your honours from Andronicus.
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	And pray the Roman gods confound you both!
         
         DEMETRIUS	Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
         
         Young LUCIUS	[Aside]  That you are both deciphered, that's the news,
         	For villains marked with rape.--May it please you,
         	My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me
         	The goodliest weapons of his armoury
         	To gratify your honourable youth,
         	The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;
         	And so I do, and with his gifts present
         	Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
         	You may be armed and appointed well:
         	And so I leave you both:
         
         	[Aside]
         		    bloody villains.
         
         	[Exeunt Young LUCIUS, and Attendant]
         
         DEMETRIUS	What's here? A scroll; and written round about?
         	Let's see;
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,
         	Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'
         
         CHIRON	O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:
         	I read it in the grammar long ago.
         
         AARON	Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
         	Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;
         	And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,
         	That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
         	But were our witty empress well afoot,
         	She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
         	But let her rest in her unrest awhile.
         
         	And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
         	Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
         	Captives, to be advanced to this height?
         	It did me good, before the palace gate
         	To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.
         
         DEMETRIUS	But me more good, to see so great a lord
         	Basely insinuate and send us gifts.
         
         AARON	Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
         	Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
         
         DEMETRIUS	I would we had a thousand Roman dames
         	At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.
         
         CHIRON	A charitable wish and full of love.
         
         AARON	Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
         
         CHIRON	And that would she for twenty thousand more.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods
         	For our beloved mother in her pains.
         
         AARON	[Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
         
         	[Trumpets sound within]
         
         DEMETRIUS	Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
         
         CHIRON	Be, for joy the emperor hath a son.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Soft! who comes here?
         
         	[Enter a Nurse, with a blackamoor Child in her arms]
         
         Nurse	Good morrow, lords:
         	O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
         
         AARON	Well, more or less, or never a whit at all,
         	Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
         
         Nurse	O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
         	Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
         
         AARON	Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
         	What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?
         
         Nurse	O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,
         	Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!
         	She is delivered, lords; she is delivered.
         
         AARON	To whom?
         
         Nurse	       I mean, she is brought a-bed.
         
         AARON	Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
         
         Nurse	A devil.
         
         AARON	Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.
         
         Nurse	A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:
         	Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
         	Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:
         	The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
         	And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
         
         AARON	'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?
         	Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Villain, what hast thou done?
         
         AARON	That which thou canst not undo.
         
         CHIRON	Thou hast undone our mother.
         
         AARON	Villain, I have done thy mother.
         
         DEMETRIUS	And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.
         	Woe to her chance, and damned her loathed choice!
         	Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!
         
         CHIRON	It shall not live.
         
         AARON	It shall not die.
         
         Nurse	Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
         
         AARON	What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I
         	Do execution on my flesh and blood.
         
         DEMETRIUS	I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:
         	Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.
         
         AARON	Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
         
         	[Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws]
         
         	Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?
         	Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
         	That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
         	He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
         	That touches this my first-born son and heir!
         	I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
         	With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,
         	Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,
         	Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
         	What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
         	Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
         	Coal-black is better than another hue,
         	In that it scorns to bear another hue;
         	For all the water in the ocean
         	Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,
         	Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
         	Tell the empress from me, I am of age
         	To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
         
         AARON	My mistress is my mistress; this myself,
         	The vigour and the picture of my youth:
         	This before all the world do I prefer;
         	This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
         	Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
         
         DEMETRIUS	By this our mother is forever shamed.
         
         CHIRON	Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
         
         Nurse	The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.
         
         CHIRON	I blush to think upon this ignomy.
         
         AARON	Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
         	Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
         	The close enacts and counsels of the heart!
         	Here's a young lad framed of another leer:
         	Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,
         	As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'
         	He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
         	Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,
         	And from that womb where you imprisoned were
         	He is enfranchised and come to light:
         	Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
         	Although my seal be stamped in his face.
         
         Nurse	Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?
         
         DEMETRIUS	Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
         	And we will all subscribe to thy advice:
         	Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.
         
         AARON	Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
         	My son and I will have the wind of you:
         	Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.
         
         	[They sit]
         
         DEMETRIUS	How many women saw this child of his?
         
         AARON	Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,
         	I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
         	The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
         	The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
         	But say, again; how many saw the child?
         
         Nurse	Cornelia the midwife and myself;
         	And no one else but the delivered empress.
         
         AARON	The empress, the midwife, and yourself:
         	Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
         	Go to the empress, tell her this I said.
         
         	[He kills the nurse]
         
         	Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.
         
         DEMETRIUS	What meanest thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?
         
         AARON	O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:
         	Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,
         	A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:
         	And now be it known to you my full intent.
         	Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;
         	His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
         	His child is  to her, fair as you are:
         	Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
         	And tell them both the circumstance of all;
         	And how by this their child shall be advanced,
         	And be received for the emperor's heir,
         	And substituted in the place of mine,
         	To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
         	And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
         	Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,
         
         	[Pointing to the nurse]
         
         	And you must needs bestow her funeral;
         	The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:
         	This done, see that you take no longer days,
         	But send the midwife presently to me.
         	The midwife and the nurse well made away,
         	Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
         
         CHIRON	Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
         	With secrets.
         
         DEMETRIUS	                  For this care of Tamora,
         	Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
         
         	[Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the
         	Nurse's body]
         
         AARON	Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;
         	There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
         	And secretly to greet the empress' friends.
         	Come on, you thick lipped slave, I'll bear you hence;
         	For it is you that puts us to our shifts:
         	I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
         	And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
         	And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
         	To be a warrior, and command a camp.

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE I	The same. A public place.
         
         
         	[Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters at the
         	ends of them; with him, MARCUS, Young LUCIUS,
         	PUBLIUS, SEMPRONIUS, CAIUS, and other Gentlemen,
         	with bows]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.
         	Sir boy, now let me see your archery;
         	Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
         	Terras Astraea reliquit:
         	Be you remembered, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.
         	Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall
         	Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;
         	Happily you may catch her in the sea;
         	Yet there's as little justice as at land:
         	No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;
         	'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
         	And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:
         	Then, when you come to Pluto's region,
         	I pray you, deliver him this petition;
         	Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,
         	And that it comes from old Andronicus,
         	Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
         	Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable
         	What time I threw the people's suffrages
         	On him that thus doth tyrannize over me.
         	Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,
         	And leave you not a man-of-war unsearched:
         	This wicked emperor may have shipped her hence;
         	And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
         	To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
         
         PUBLIUS	Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns
         	By day and night to attend him carefully,
         	And feed his humour kindly as we may,
         	Till time beget some careful remedy.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
         	Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war
         	Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,
         	And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Publius, how now! how now, my masters!
         	What, have you met with her?
         
         PUBLIUS	No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
         	If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:
         	Marry, for Justice, she is so employed,
         	He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,
         	So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
         	I'll dive into the burning lake below,
         	And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
         	Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we
         	No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;
         	But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,
         	Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:
         	And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,
         	We will solicit heaven and move the gods
         	To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.
         	Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;
         
         	[He gives them the arrows]
         
         	'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:'
         	'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:
         	Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:
         	To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;
         	You were as good to shoot against the wind.
         	To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid.
         	Of my word, I have written to effect;
         	There's not a god left unsolicited.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:
         	We will afflict the emperor in his pride.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Now, masters, draw.
         
         	[They shoot]
         		O, well said, Lucius!
         	Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
         	Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ha, ha!
         	Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?
         	See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,
         	The Bull, being galled, gave Aries such a knock
         	That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;
         	And who should find them but the empress' villain?
         	She laughed, and told the Moor he should not choose
         	But give them to his master for a present.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!
         
         	[Enter a Clown, with a basket, and two pigeons in
         	it]
         
         	News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.
         	Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?
         	Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?
         
         Clown	O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken
         	them down again, for the man must not be hanged till
         	the next week.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
         
         Clown	Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him
         	in all my life.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
         
         Clown	Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
         
         Clown	From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there     God
         	forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my
         	young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the
         	tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl
         	betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for
         	your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to
         	the emperor from you.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor
         	with a grace?
         
         Clown	Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,
         	But give your pigeons to the emperor:
         	By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
         	Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.
         	Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace
         	deliver a supplication?
         
         Clown	Ay, sir.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Then here is a supplication for you. And when you
         	come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,
         	then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and
         	then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see
         	you do it bravely.
         
         Clown	I warrant you, sir, let me alone.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it.
         	Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
         	For thou hast made it  an humble suppliant.
         	And when thou hast given it the emperor,
         	Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
         
         Clown	God be with you, sir; I will.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The same. Before the palace.
         
         
         	[Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON,
         	Lords, and others; SATURNINUS with the arrows in
         	his hand that TITUS shot]
         
         SATURNINUS	Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen
         	An emperor in Rome thus overborne,
         	Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent
         	Of egal justice, used in such contempt?
         	My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
         	However these disturbers of our peace
         	Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath passed,
         	But even with law, against the willful sons
         	Of old Andronicus. And what an if
         	His sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits,
         	Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
         	His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
         	And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
         	See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;
         	This to Apollo; this to the god of war;
         	Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
         	What's this but libelling against the senate,
         	And blazoning our injustice every where?
         	A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
         	As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
         	But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
         	Shall be no shelter to these outrages:
         	But he and his shall know that justice lives
         	In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,
         	He'll so awake as she in fury shall
         	Cut off the proudest conspirator that lives.
         
         TAMORA	My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
         	Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
         	Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
         	The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,
         	Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart;
         	And rather comfort his distressed plight
         	Than prosecute the meanest or the best
         	For these contempts.
         
         	[Aside]
         
         		Why, thus it shall become
         	High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:
         	But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,
         	Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,
         	Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.
         
         	[Enter Clown]
         
         	How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?
         
         Clown	Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.
         
         TAMORA	Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.
         
         Clown	'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:
         	I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
         
         	[SATURNINUS reads the letter]
         
         SATURNINUS	Go, take him away, and hang him presently.
         
         Clown	How much money must I have?
         
         TAMORA	Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.
         
         Clown	Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to
         	a fair end.
         
         	[Exit, guarded]
         
         SATURNINUS	Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
         	Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
         	I know from whence this same device proceeds:
         	May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,
         	That died by law for murder of our brother,
         	Have by my means been butchered wrongfully!
         	Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;
         	Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:
         	For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;
         	Sly frantic wretch, that holpest to make me great,
         	In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.
         
         	[Enter AEMILIUS]
         
         	What news with thee, AEmilius?
         
         AEMILIUS	Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause.
         	The Goths have gathered head; and with a power
         	high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,
         	They hither march amain, under conduct
         	Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;
         	Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do
         	As much as ever Coriolanus did.
         
         SATURNINUS	Is war Lucius general of the Goths?
         	These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
         	As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:
         	Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:
         	'Tis he the common people love so much;
         	Myself hath often over-heard them say,
         	When I have walked  a private man,
         	That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
         	And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor.
         
         TAMORA	Why should you fear? is not your city strong?
         
         SATURNINUS	Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,
         	And will revolt from me to succor him.
         
         TAMORA	King, be thy thoughts imperious,  thy name.
         	Is the sun dimmed, that gnats do fly in it?
         	The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
         	And is not careful what they mean thereby,
         	Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
         	He can at pleasure stint their melody:
         	Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
         	Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,
         	I will enchant the old Andronicus
         	With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,
         	Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,
         	When as the one is wounded with the bait,
         	The other rotted with delicious feed.
         
         SATURNINUS	But he will not entreat his son for us.
         
         TAMORA	If Tamora entreat him, then he will:
         	For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
         	With golden promises; that, were his heart
         	Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,
         	Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
         
         	[To AEmilius]
         
         	Go thou before, be our ambassador:
         	Say that the emperor requests a parley
         	Of war Lucius, and appoint the meeting
         	Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.
         
         SATURNINUS	AEmilius, do this message honourably:
         	And if he stand on hostage for his safety,
         	Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.
         
         AEMILIUS	Your bidding shall I do effectually.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         TAMORA	Now will I to that old Andronicus;
         	And temper him with all the art I have,
         	To pluck proud Lucius from the war Goths.
         	And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,
         	And bury all thy fear in my devices.
         
         SATURNINUS	Then go successantly, and plead to him.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT V
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Plains near Rome.
         
         
         	[Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours]
         
         LUCIUS	Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
         	I have received letters from great Rome,
         	Which signify what hate they bear their emperor
         	And how desirous of our sight they are.
         	Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,
         	Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,
         	And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
         	Let him make treble satisfaction.
         
         First Goth	Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
         	Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;
         	Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
         	Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,
         	Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou leadest,
         	 stinging bees in hottest summer's day
         	Led by their master to the flowered fields,
         	And be avenged on cursed Tamora.
         
         All the Goths	And as he saith, so say we all with him.
         
         LUCIUS	I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
         	But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?
         
         	[Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms]
         
         Second Goth	Renowned Lucius, from our troops I strayed
         	To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
         	And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye
         	Upon the wasted building, suddenly
         	I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
         	I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
         	The crying babe controlled with this discourse:
         	'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
         	Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
         	Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
         	Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:
         	But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
         	They never do beget a coal-black calf.
         	Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates
         	the babe,--
         	'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
         	Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,
         	Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
         	With this, my weapon drawn, I rushed upon him,
         	Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,
         	To use as you think needful of the man.
         
         LUCIUS	O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
         	That robbed Andronicus of his good hand;
         	This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,
         	And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
         	Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey
         	This growing image of thy fiend- face?
         	Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?
         	A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.
         	And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
         
         AARON	Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.
         
         LUCIUS	Too  the sire for ever being good.
         	First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;
         	A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
         	Get me a ladder.
         
         	[A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend]
         
         AARON	                  Lucius, save the child,
         	And bear it from me to the empress.
         	If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
         	That highly may advantage thee to hear:
         	If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
         	I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
         
         LUCIUS	Say on: an if it please me which thou speakest
         	Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourished.
         
         AARON	An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,
         	'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
         	For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,
         	Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
         	Complots of mischief, treason, villanies
         	Ruthful to hear, yet piteously performed:
         	And this shall all be buried by my death,
         	Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
         
         LUCIUS	Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
         
         AARON	Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
         
         LUCIUS	Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:
         	That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
         
         AARON	What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;
         	Yet, for I know thou art religious
         	And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
         	With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
         	Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
         	Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
         	An idiot holds his bauble for a god
         	And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
         	To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
         	By that same god, what god soever it be,
         	That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
         	To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;
         	Or else I will discover nought to thee.
         
         LUCIUS	Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
         
         AARON	First know thou, I begot him on the empress.
         
         LUCIUS	O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
         
         AARON	Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
         	To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
         	'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;
         	They cut thy sister's tongue and ravished her
         	And cut her hands and trimmed her as thou sawest.
         
         LUCIUS	O detestable villain! callest thou that trimming?
         
         AARON	Why, she was washed and cut and trimmed, and 'twas
         	Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
         
         LUCIUS	O barbarous, beastly villains,  thyself!
         
         AARON	Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:
         	That codding spirit had they from their mother,
         	As sure a card as ever won the set;
         	That bloody mind, I think, they learned of me,
         	As true a dog as ever fought at head.
         	Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
         	I trained thy brethren to that guileful hole
         	Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
         	I wrote the letter that thy father found
         	And hid the gold within the letter mentioned,
         	Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
         	And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
         	Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
         	I played the cheater for thy father's hand,
         	And, when I had it, drew myself apart
         	And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
         	I pryed me through the crevice of a wall
         	When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
         	Beheld his tears, and laughed so heartily,
         	That both mine eyes were rainy  to his :
         	And when I told the empress of this sport,
         	She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
         	And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
         
         First Goth	What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?
         
         AARON	Ay,  a black dog, as the saying is.
         
         LUCIUS	Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
         
         AARON	Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
         	Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
         	Few come within the compass of my curse,--
         	Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
         	As kill a man, or else devise his death,
         	Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,
         	Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,
         	Set deadly enmity between two friends,
         	Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
         	Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
         	And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
         	Oft have I digged up dead men from their graves,
         	And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
         	Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
         	And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
         	Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
         	'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
         	Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
         	As willingly as one would kill a fly,
         	And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
         	But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
         
         LUCIUS	Bring down the devil; for he must not die
         	So sweet a death as hanging presently.
         
         AARON	If there be devils, would I were a devil,
         	To live and burn in everlasting fire,
         	So I might have your company in hell,
         	But to torment you with my bitter tongue!
         
         LUCIUS	Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
         
         	[Enter a Goth]
         
         Third Goth	My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
         	Desires to be admitted to your presence.
         
         LUCIUS	Let him come near.
         
         	[Enter AEMILIUS]
         
         	Welcome, AEmilius	what's the news from Rome?
         
         AEMILIUS	Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,
         	The Roman emperor greets you all by me;
         	And, for he understands you are in arms,
         	He craves a parley at your father's house,
         	Willing you to demand your hostages,
         	And they shall be immediately delivered.
         
         First Goth	What says our general?
         
         LUCIUS	AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges
         	Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
         	And we will come. March away.

         	[Enter TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, disguised]
         
         TAMORA	Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
         	I will encounter with Andronicus,
         	And say I am Revenge, sent from below
         	To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
         	Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,
         	To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;
         	Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,
         	And work confusion on his enemies.
         
         	[They knock]
         
         	[Enter TITUS, above]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Who doth molest my contemplation?
         	Is it your trick to make me ope the door,
         	That so my sad decrees may fly away,
         	And all my study be to no effect?
         	You are deceived: for what I mean to do
         	See here in bloody lines I have set down;
         	And what is written shall be executed.
         
         TAMORA	Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,
         	Wanting a hand to give it action?
         	Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.
         
         TAMORA	If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	I am not mad; I know thee well enough:
         	Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;
         	Witness these trenches made by grief and care,
         	Witness the tiring day and heavy night;
         	Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well
         	For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:
         	Is not thy coming for my other hand?
         
         TAMORA	Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;
         	She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:
         	I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,
         	To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,
         	By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
         	Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;
         	Confer with me of murder and of death:
         	There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
         	No vast obscurity or misty vale,
         	Where bloody murder or detested rape
         	Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;
         	And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
         	Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,
         	To be a torment to mine enemies?
         
         TAMORA	I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Do me some service, ere I come to thee.
         	Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
         	Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,
         	Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;
         	And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,
         	And whirl along with thee about the globe.
         	Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,
         	To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
         	And find out murderers in their guilty caves:
         	And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
         	I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel
         	Trot,  a servile footman, all day long,
         	Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
         	Until his very downfall in the sea:
         	And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
         	So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
         
         TAMORA	These are my ministers, and come with me.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Are these thy ministers? what are they called?
         
         TAMORA	Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,
         	Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Good Lord, how  the empress' sons they are!
         	And you, the empress! but we worldly men
         	Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.
         	O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;
         	And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,
         	I will embrace thee in it by and by.
         
         	[Exit above]
         
         TAMORA	This closing with him fits his lunacy
         	Whatever I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,
         	Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
         	For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
         	And, being credulous in this mad thought,
         	I'll make him send for Lucius his son;
         	And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
         	I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,
         	To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
         	Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
         	See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
         
         	[Enter TITUS below]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:
         	Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:
         	Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
         	How  the empress and her sons you are!
         	Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:
         	Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
         	For well I wot the empress never wags
         	But in her company there is a Moor;
         	And, would you represent our queen aright,
         	It were convenient you had such a devil:
         	But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?
         
         TAMORA	What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
         
         DEMETRIUS	Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
         
         CHIRON	Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
         	And I am sent to be revenged on him.
         
         TAMORA	Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,
         	And I will be revenged on them all.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;
         	And when thou findest a man that's  thyself.
         	Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.
         	Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
         	To find another that is  to thee,
         	Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.
         	Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court
         	There is a queen, attended by a Moor;
         	Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,
         	for up and down she doth resemble thee:
         	I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
         	They have been violent to me and mine.
         
         TAMORA	Well hast thou lessoned us; this shall we do.
         	But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
         	To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
         	Who leads towards Rome a band of war Goths,
         	And bid him come and banquet at thy house;
         	When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
         	I will bring in the empress and her sons,
         	The emperor himself and all thy foes;
         	And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,
         	And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
         	What says Andronicus to this device?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
         
         	[Enter MARCUS]
         
         	Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
         	Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
         	Bid him repair to me, and bring with him
         	Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;
         	Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
         	Tell him the emperor and the empress too
         	Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
         	This do thou for my love; and so let him,
         	As he regards his aged father's life.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	This will I do, and soon return again.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         TAMORA	Now will I hence about thy business,
         	And take my ministers along with me.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;
         	Or else I'll call my brother back again,
         	And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
         
         TAMORA	[Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? will you
         	bide with him,
         	Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
         	How I have governed our determined jest?
         	Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
         	And tarry with him till I turn again.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	[Aside]  I know them all, though they suppose me mad,
         	And will overreach them in their own devices:
         	A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!
         
         DEMETRIUS	Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
         
         TAMORA	Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes
         	To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
         
         	[Exit TAMORA]
         
         CHIRON	Tell us, old man, how shall we be employed?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
         	Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!
         
         	[Enter PUBLIUS and others]
         
         PUBLIUS	What is your will?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Know you these two?
         
         PUBLIUS	The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;
         	The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;
         	And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.
         	Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.
         	Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
         	And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,
         	And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         	[PUBLIUS, &amp;c. lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS]
         
         CHIRON	Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
         
         PUBLIUS	And therefore do we what we are commanded.
         	Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
         	Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.
         
         	[Re-enter TITUS, with LAVINIA; he bearing a knife,
         	and she a basin]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
         	Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;
         	But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
         	O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
         	Here stands the spring whom you have stained with mud,
         	This goodly summer with your winter mixed.
         	You killed her husband, and for that vile fault
         	Two of her brothers were condemned to death,
         	My hand cut off and made a merry jest;
         	Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
         	Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
         	Inhuman traitors, you constrained and forced.
         	What would you say, if I should let you speak?
         	Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
         	Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
         	This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
         	Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
         	The basin that receives your guilty blood.
         	You know your mother means to feast with me,
         	And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:
         	Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust
         	And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,
         	And of the paste a coffin I will rear
         	And make two pasties of your shameful heads,
         	And bid that strumpet, your unhallowed dam,
         	 to the earth swallow her own increase.
         	This is the feast that I have bid her to,
         	And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
         	For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,
         	And worse than Progne I will be revenged:
         	And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,
         
         	[He cuts their throats]
         
         	Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
         	Let me go grind their bones to powder small
         	And with this hateful liquor temper it;
         	And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.
         	Come, come, be every one officious
         	To make this banquet; which I wish may prove
         	More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
         	So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,
         	And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.
         
         	[Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies]

         ACT V
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Court of TITUS's house. A banquet set out.
         
         
         	[Enter LUCIUS, MARCUS, and Goths, with AARON prisoner]
         
         LUCIUS	Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind
         	That I repair to Rome, I am content.
         
         First Goth	And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.
         
         LUCIUS	Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
         	This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;
         	Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him
         	Till he be brought unto the empress' face,
         	For testimony of her foul proceedings:
         	And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
         	I fear the emperor means no good to us.
         
         AARON	Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,
         	And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth
         	The venomous malice of my swelling heart!
         
         LUCIUS	Away, inhuman dog! unhallowed slave!
         	Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
         
         	[Exeunt Goths, with AARON. Flourish within]
         
         	The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.
         
         	[Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA, with AEMILIUS,
         	Tribunes, Senators, and others]
         
         SATURNINUS	What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
         
         LUCIUS	What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;
         	These quarrels must be quietly debated.
         	The feast is ready, which the careful Titus
         	Hath ordained to an honourable end,
         	For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:
         	Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.
         
         SATURNINUS	Marcus, we will.
         
         	[Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table]
         
         	[Enter TITUS dressed  a Cook, LAVINIA veiled,
         	Young LUCIUS, and others. TITUS places the dishes
         	on the table]
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;
         	Welcome, ye war Goths; welcome, Lucius;
         	And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,
         	'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
         
         SATURNINUS	Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Because I would be sure to have all well,
         	To entertain your highness and your empress.
         
         TAMORA	We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	An if your highness knew my heart, you were.
         	My lord the emperor, resolve me this:
         	Was it well done of rash Virginius
         	To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
         	Because she was enforced, stained, and deflowered?
         
         SATURNINUS	It was, Andronicus.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Your reason, mighty lord?
         
         SATURNINUS	Because the girl should not survive her shame,
         	And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
         	A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,
         	For me, most wretched, to perform the .
         	Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;
         
         	[Kills LAVINIA]
         
         	And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!
         
         SATURNINUS	What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Killed her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
         	I am as woful as Virginius was,
         	And have a thousand times more cause than he
         	To do this outrage: and it now is done.
         
         SATURNINUS	What, was she ravished? tell who did the deed.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Will't please you eat? will't please your
         	highness feed?
         
         TAMORA	Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:
         	They ravished her, and cut away her tongue;
         	And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
         
         SATURNINUS	Go fetch them hither to us presently.
         
         TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;
         	Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
         	Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
         	'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.
         
         	[Kills TAMORA]
         
         SATURNINUS	Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
         
         	[Kills TITUS]
         
         LUCIUS	Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
         	There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!
         
         	[Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS, MARCUS,
         	and others go up into the balcony]
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
         	By uproar severed,  a flight of fowl
         	Scattered by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
         	O, let me teach you how to knit again
         	This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,
         	These broken limbs again into one body;
         	Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
         	And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,
         	 a forlorn and desperate castaway,
         	Do shameful execution on herself.
         	But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
         	Grave witnesses of true experience,
         	Cannot induce you to attend my words,
         
         	[To LUCIUS]
         
         	Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
         	When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
         	To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
         	The story of that baleful burning night
         	When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,
         	Tell us what Sinon hath bewitched our ears,
         	Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
         	That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
         	My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
         	Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
         	But floods of tears will drown my oratory,
         	And break my utterance, even in the time
         	When it should move you to attend me most,
         	Lending your kind commiseration.
         	Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
         	Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
         
         LUCIUS	Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,
         	That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
         	Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;
         	And they it were that ravished our sister:
         	For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;
         	Our father's tears despised, and basely cozened
         	Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
         	And sent her enemies unto the grave.
         	Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
         	The gates shut on me, and turned weeping out,
         	To beg relief among Rome's enemies:
         	Who drowned their enmity in my true tears.
         	And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
         	I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
         	That have preserved her welfare in my blood;
         	And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
         	Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
         	Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;
         	My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
         	That my report is just and full of truth.
         	But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
         	Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;
         	For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
         
         	[Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant]
         
         	Of this was Tamora delivered;
         	The issue of an irreligious Moor,
         	Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
         	The villain is alive in Titus' house,
         	And as he is, to witness this is true.
         	Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
         	These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,
         	Or more than any living man could bear.
         	Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?
         	Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,
         	And, from the place where you behold us now,
         	The poor remainder of Andronici
         	Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.
         	And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,
         	And make a mutual closure of our house.
         	Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,
         	Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
         
         AEMILIUS	Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
         	And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
         	Lucius our emperor; for well I know
         	The common voice do cry it shall be so.
         
         All	Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,
         
         	[To Attendants]
         
         	And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,
         	To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,
         	As punishment for his most wicked life.
         
         	[Exeunt Attendants]
         
         	[LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend]
         
         All	Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
         
         LUCIUS	Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,
         	To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!
         	But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
         	For nature puts me to a heavy task:
         	Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,
         	To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
         	O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
         
         	[Kissing TITUS]
         
         	These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stained face,
         	The last true duties of thy noble son!
         
         MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
         	Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
         	O were the sum of these that I should pay
         	Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!
         
         LUCIUS	Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
         	To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:
         	Many a time he danced thee on his knee,
         	Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:
         	Many a matter hath he told to thee,
         	Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;
         	In that respect, then,  a loving child,
         	Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
         	Because kind nature doth require it so:
         	Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:
         	Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
         	Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.
         
         Young LUCIUS	O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart
         	Would I were dead, so you did live again!
         	O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;
         	My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.
         
         	[Re-enter Attendants with AARON]
         
         AEMILIUS	You sad Andronici, have done with woes:
         	Give sentence on this execrable wretch,
         	That hath been breeder of these dire events.
         
         LUCIUS	Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
         	There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
         	If any one relieves or pities him,
         	For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
         	Some stay to see him fastened in the earth.
         
         AARON	O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
         	I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
         	I should repent the evils I have done:
         	Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
         	Would I perform, if I might have my will;
         	If one good deed in all my life I did,
         	I do repent it from my very soul.
         
         LUCIUS	Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
         	And give him burial in his father's grave:
         	My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
         	Be closed in our household's monument.
         	As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,
         	No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,
         	No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
         	But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:
         	Her life was beast-, and devoid of pity;
         	And, being so, shall have  want of pity.

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	London. A street.
         
         	[Enter GLOUCESTER, solus]
         
         GLOUCESTER	Now is the winter of our discontent
         	Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
         	And all the clouds that loured upon our house
         	In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
         	Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
         	Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
         	Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
         	Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
         	Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;
         	And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
         	To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
         	He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
         	To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
         	But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
         	Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
         	I, that am rudely stamped, and want love's majesty
         	To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
         	I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,
         	Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
         	Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time
         	Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
         	And that so lamely and unfashionable
         	That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
         	Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
         	Have no delight to pass away the time,
         	Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
         	And descant on mine own deformity:
         	And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
         	To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
         	I am determined to prove a villain
         	And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
         	Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
         	By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
         	To set my brother Clarence and the king
         	In deadly hate the one against the other:
         	And if King Edward be as true and just
         	As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
         	This day should Clarence closely be mewed up,
         	About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
         	Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
         	Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
         	Clarence comes.
         
         	[Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY]
         
         	Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
         	That waits upon your grace?
         
         CLARENCE	His majesty
         	Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
         	This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Upon what cause?
         
         CLARENCE	                  Because my name is George.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
         	He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
         	O, be his majesty hath some intent
         	That you shall be new-christened in the Tower.
         	But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
         
         CLARENCE	Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
         	As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
         	He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
         	And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
         	And says a wizard told him that by G
         	His issue disinherited should be;
         	And, for my name of George begins with G,
         	It follows in his thought that I am he.
         	These, as I learn, and such  toys as these
         	Have moved his highness to commit me now.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
         	'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
         	My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
         	That tempers him to this extremity.
         	Was it not she and that good man of worship,
         	Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
         	That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
         	From whence this present day he is delivered?
         	We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
         
         CLARENCE	By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
         	But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
         	That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
         	Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
         	Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
         
         GLOUCESTER	Humbly complaining to her deity
         	Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
         	I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
         	If we will keep in favour with the king,
         	To be her men and wear her livery:
         	The jealous overworn widow and herself,
         	Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen.
         	Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
         
         BRAKENBURY	I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
         	His majesty hath straitly given in charge
         	That no man shall have private conference,
         	Of what degree soever, with his brother.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
         	You may partake of any thing we say:
         	We speak no treason, man: we say the king
         	Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
         	Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
         	We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
         	A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
         	And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
         	How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
         
         BRAKENBURY	With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
         	He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
         	Were best he do it secretly, alone.
         
         BRAKENBURY	What one, my lord?
         
         GLOUCESTER	Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
         
         BRAKENBURY	I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
         	Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
         
         CLARENCE	We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
         
         GLOUCESTER	We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
         	Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
         	And whatsoever you will employ me in,
         	Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
         	I will perform it to enfranchise you.
         	Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
         	Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
         
         CLARENCE	I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
         	Meantime, have patience.
         
         CLARENCE	I must perforce. Farewell.
         
         	[Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard]
         
         GLOUCESTER	Go, tread the path that thou shalt never return.
         	Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
         	That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
         	If heaven will take the present at our hands.
         	But who comes here? the new-delivered Hastings?
         
         	[Enter HASTINGS]
         
         HASTINGS	Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
         
         GLOUCESTER	As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
         	Well are you welcome to the open air.
         	How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?
         
         HASTINGS	With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
         	But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
         	That were the cause of my imprisonment.
         
         GLOUCESTER	No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
         	For they that were your enemies are his,
         	And have prevailed as much on him as you.
         
         HASTINGS	More pity that the eagle should be mewed,
         	While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
         
         GLOUCESTER	What news abroad?
         
         HASTINGS	No news so bad abroad as this at home;
         	The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
         	And his physicians fear him mightily.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
         	O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
         	And overmuch consumed his royal person:
         	'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
         	What, is he in his bed?
         
         HASTINGS	He is.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Go you before, and I will follow you.
         
         	[Exit HASTINGS]
         
         	He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
         	Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.
         	I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
         	With lies well steeled with weighty arguments;
         	And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
         	Clarence hath not another day to live:
         	Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
         	And leave the world for me to bustle in!
         	For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
         	What though I killed her husband and her father?
         	The readiest way to make the wench amends
         	Is to become her husband and her father:
         	The which will I; not all so much for love
         	As for another secret close intent,
         	By marrying her which I must reach unto.
         	But yet I run before my horse to market:
         	Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
         	When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

         	If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
         	Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
         	The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
         	Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
         	Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
         	Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
         	Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
         	To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
         	Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,
         	Stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
         	Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
         	I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
         	Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
         	Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
         	Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
         	More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
         	That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
         	Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
         	Or any creeping venomed thing that lives!
         	If ever he have child, abortive be it,
         	Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
         	Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
         	May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
         	And that be heir to his unhappiness!
         	If ever he have wife, let her he made
         	A miserable by the death of him
         	As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
         	Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
         	Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
         	And still, as you are weary of the weight,
         	Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.

         	And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
         
         LADY ANNE	What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
         	Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
         	And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
         	Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
         	Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
         	His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.

         	For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
         	Filled it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
         	If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
         	Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
         	O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
         	Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh!
         	Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
         	For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
         	From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
         	Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
         	Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
         	O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
         	O earth, which this blood drinkest revenge his death!
         	Either heaven with lightning strike the
         	murderer dead,
         	Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
         	As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
         	Which his hell-governed arm hath butchered!
         
         GLOUCESTER	Lady, you know no rules of charity,
         	Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
         
         LADY ANNE	Villain, thou knowest no law of God nor man:
         	No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
         
         GLOUCESTER	But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
         
         LADY ANNE	O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
         
         GLOUCESTER	More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
         	Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
         	Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
         	By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
         
         LADY ANNE	Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
         	For these known evils, but to give me leave,
         	By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
         	Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
         
         LADY ANNE	Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
         	No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
         
         GLOUCESTER	By such despair, I should accuse myself.
         
         LADY ANNE	And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
         	For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
         	Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Say that I slew them not?
         
         LADY ANNE	Why, then they are not dead:
         	But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
         
         GLOUCESTER	I did not kill your husband.
         
         LADY ANNE	Why, then he is alive.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
         
         LADY ANNE	In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
         	Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
         	The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
         	But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
         
         GLOUCESTER	I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
         	which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
         
         LADY ANNE	Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
         	Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
         	Didst thou not kill this king?
         
         GLOUCESTER	I grant ye.
         
         LADY ANNE	Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
         	Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
         	O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
         
         GLOUCESTER	The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
         
         LADY ANNE	He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
         	For he was fitter for that place than earth.
         
         LADY ANNE	And thou unfit for any place but hell.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
         
         LADY ANNE	Some dungeon.
         
         GLOUCESTER	                             Your bed-chamber.
         
         LADY ANNE	I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
         
         GLOUCESTER	So will it, madam till I lie with you.
         
         LADY ANNE	I hope so.
         
         GLOUCESTER	I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
         	To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
         	And fall somewhat into a slower method,
         	Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
         	Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
         	As blameful as the executioner?
         
         LADY ANNE	Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
         	Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
         	To undertake the death of all the world,
         	So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
         
         LADY ANNE	If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
         	These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
         
         GLOUCESTER	These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
         	You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
         	As all the world is cheered by the sun,
         	So I by that; it is my day, my life.
         
         LADY ANNE	Black night overshade thy day, and death thy life!
         
         GLOUCESTER	Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
         
         LADY ANNE	I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
         
         GLOUCESTER	It is a quarrel most unnatural,
         	To be revenged on him that loveth you.
         
         LADY ANNE	It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
         	To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
         
         GLOUCESTER	He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
         	Did it to help thee to a better husband.
         
         LADY ANNE	His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
         
         GLOUCESTER	He lives that loves thee better than he could.
         
         LADY ANNE	Name him.
         
         GLOUCESTER	        Plantagenet.
         
         LADY ANNE	Why, that was he.
         
         GLOUCESTER	The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
         
         LADY ANNE	Where is he?
         
         GLOUCESTER	                 Here.
         
         	[She spitteth at him]
         
         	Why dost thou spit at me?
         
         LADY ANNE	Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
         
         GLOUCESTER	Never came poison from so sweet a place.
         
         LADY ANNE	Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
         	Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
         
         LADY ANNE	Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
         
         GLOUCESTER	I would they were, that I might die at once;
         	For now they kill me with a living death.
         	Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
         	Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
         	These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
         	No, when my father York and Edward wept,
         	To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
         	When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
         	Nor when thy war father,  a child,
         	Told the sad story of my father's death,
         	And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
         	That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
         	 trees bedashed with rain: in that sad time
         	My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
         	And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
         	Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
         	I never sued to friend nor enemy;
         	My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
         	But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
         	My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
         
         	[She looks scornfully at him]
         
         	Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
         	For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
         	If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
         	Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
         	Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
         	And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
         	I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
         	And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
         
         	[He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword]
         
         	Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
         	But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
         	Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabbed young Edward,
         	But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
         
         	[Here she lets fall the sword]
         
         	Take up the sword again, or take up me.
         
         LADY ANNE	Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
         	I will not be the executioner.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
         
         LADY ANNE	I have already.
         
         GLOUCESTER	                  Tush, that was in thy rage:
         	Speak it again, and, even with the word,
         	That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
         	Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
         	To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
         
         LADY ANNE	I would I knew thy heart.
         
         GLOUCESTER	'Tis figured in my tongue.
         
         LADY ANNE	I fear me both are false.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Then never man was true.
         
         LADY ANNE	Well, well, put up your sword.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Say, then, my peace is made.
         
         LADY ANNE	That shall you know hereafter.
         
         GLOUCESTER	But shall I live in hope?
         
         LADY ANNE	All men, I hope, live so.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
         
         LADY ANNE	To take is not to give.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
         	Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
         	Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
         	And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
         	But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
         	Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
         
         LADY ANNE	What is it?
         
         GLOUCESTER	That it would please thee leave these sad designs
         	To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
         	And presently repair to Crosby Place;
         	Where, after I have solemnly interred
         	At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
         	And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
         	I will with all expedient duty see you:
         	For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
         	Grant me this boon.
         
         LADY ANNE	With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
         	To see you are become so penitent.
         	Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Bid me farewell.
         
         LADY ANNE	'Tis more than you deserve;
         	But since you teach me how to flatter you,
         	Imagine I have said farewell already.
         
         	[Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY]
         
         GLOUCESTER	Sirs, take up the corse.
         
         GENTLEMEN	Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
         
         GLOUCESTER	No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
         
         	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]
         
         	Was ever woman in this humour wooed?
         	Was ever woman in this humour won?
         	I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
         	What! I, that killed her husband and his father,
         	To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
         	With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
         	The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
         	Having God, her conscience, and these bars
         	against me,
         	And I nothing to back my suit at all,
         	But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
         	And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
         	Ha!
         	Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
         	Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
         	Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
         	A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
         	Framed in the prodigality of nature,
         	Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
         	The spacious world cannot again afford
         	And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
         	That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince,
         	And made her widow to a woful bed?
         	On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
         	On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
         	My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
         	I do mistake my person all this while:
         	Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
         	Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
         	I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
         	And entertain some score or two of tailors,
         	To study fashions to adorn my body:
         	Since I am crept in favour with myself,
         	Will maintain it with some little cost.
         	But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
         	And then return lamenting to my love.
         	Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
         	That I may see my shadow as I pass.

         SCENE I	The palace.
         
         
         	[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY]
         
         RIVERS	Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
         	Will soon recover his accustomed health.
         
         GREY	In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
         	Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
         	And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	If he were dead, what would betide of me?
         
         RIVERS	No other harm but loss of such a lord.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
         
         GREY	The heavens have blessed you with a goodly son,
         	To be your comforter when he is gone.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Oh, he is young and his minority
         	Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
         	A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
         
         RIVERS	Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	It is determined, not concluded yet:
         	But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
         
         	[Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY]
         
         GREY	Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Good time of day unto your royal grace!
         
         DERBY	God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
         	To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
         	Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
         	And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
         	I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
         
         DERBY	I do beseech you, either not believe
         	The envious slanders of her false accusers;
         	Or, if she be accused in true report,
         	Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
         	From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
         
         RIVERS	Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
         
         DERBY	But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
         	Are come from visiting his majesty.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	What lihood of his amendment, lords?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
         	Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
         	And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
         	And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Would all were well! but that will never be
         	I fear our happiness is at the highest.
         
         	[Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET]
         
         GLOUCESTER	They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
         	Who are they that complain unto the king,
         	That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
         	By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
         	That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
         	Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
         	Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
         	Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
         	I must be held a rancorous enemy.
         	Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
         	But thus his simple truth must be abused
         	By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
         
         RIVERS	To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
         
         GLOUCESTER	To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
         	When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
         	Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
         	A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
         	Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
         	Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
         	But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
         	The king, of his own royal disposition,
         	And not provoked by any suitor else;
         	Aiming, be, at your interior hatred,
         	Which in your outward actions shows itself
         	Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
         	Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
         	The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
         
         GLOUCESTER	I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
         	That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
         	Since every Jack became a gentleman
         	There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
         	Gloucester;
         	You envy my advancement and my friends':
         	God grant we never may have need of you!
         
         GLOUCESTER	Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
         	Your brother is imprisoned by your means,
         	Myself disgraced, and the nobility
         	Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
         	Are daily given to ennoble those
         	That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	By Him that raised me to this careful height
         	From that contented hap which I enjoyed,
         	I never did incense his majesty
         	Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
         	An earnest advocate to plead for him.
         	My lord, you do me shameful injury,
         	Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
         
         GLOUCESTER	You may deny that you were not the cause
         	Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
         
         RIVERS	She may, my lord, for--
         
         GLOUCESTER	She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
         	She may do more, sir, than denying that:
         	She may help you to many fair preferments,
         	And then deny her aiding hand therein,
         	And lay those honours on your high deserts.
         	What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
         
         RIVERS	What, marry, may she?
         
         GLOUCESTER	What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
         	A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
         	I wis your grandam had a worser match.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
         	Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
         	By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
         	With those gross taunts I often have endured.
         	I had rather be a country servant-maid
         	Than a great queen, with this condition,
         	To be thus taunted, scorned, and baited at:
         
         	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind]
         
         	Small joy have I in being England's queen.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	And lessened be that small, God, I beseech thee!
         	Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
         
         GLOUCESTER	What! threat you me with telling of the king?
         	Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
         	I will avouch in presence of the king:
         	I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
         	'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Out, devil! I remember them too well:
         	Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
         	And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
         	I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
         	A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
         	A liberal rewarder of his friends:
         	To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
         
         GLOUCESTER	In all which time you and your husband Grey
         	Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
         	And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
         	In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
         	Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
         	What you have been ere now, and what you are;
         	Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
         	Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Which God revenge!
         
         GLOUCESTER	To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
         	And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.
         	I would to God my heart were flint,  Edward's;
         	Or Edward's soft and pitiful,  mine
         	I am too childish-foolish for this world.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
         	Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
         
         RIVERS	My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
         	Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
         	We followed then our lord, our lawful king:
         	So should we you, if you should be our king.
         
         GLOUCESTER	If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
         	Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
         	You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
         	As little joy may you suppose in me.
         	That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
         	For I am she, and altogether joyless.
         	I can no longer hold me patient.
         
         	[Advancing]
         
         	Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
         	In sharing that which you have pilled from me!
         	Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
         	If not, that, I being queen, you bow  subjects,
         	Yet that, by you deposed, you quake  rebels?
         	O gentle villain, do not turn away!
         
         GLOUCESTER	Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	But repetition of what thou hast marred;
         	That will I make before I let thee go.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
         	Than death can yield me here by my abode.
         	A husband and a son thou owest to me;
         	And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
         	The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
         	And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
         
         GLOUCESTER	The curse my noble father laid on thee,
         	When thou didst crown his war brows with paper
         	And with thy scorns drewest rivers from his eyes,
         	And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
         	Steeped in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
         	His curses, then from bitterness of soul
         	Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
         	And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	So just is God, to right the innocent.
         
         HASTINGS	O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
         	And the most merciless that ever was heard of!
         
         RIVERS	Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
         
         DORSET	No man but prophesied revenge for it.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	What were you snarling all before I came,
         	Ready to catch each other by the throat,
         	And turn you all your hatred now on me?
         	Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
         	That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
         	Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
         	Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
         	Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
         	Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
         	If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
         	As ours by murder, to make him a king!
         	Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
         	For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
         	Die in his youth by  untimely violence!
         	Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
         	Outlive thy glory,  my wretched self!
         	Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
         	And see another, as I see thee now,
         	Decked in thy rights, as thou art stalled in mine!
         	Long die thy happy days before thy death;
         	And, after many lengthened hours of grief,
         	Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
         	Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
         	And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
         	Was stabbed with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
         	That none of you may live your natural age,
         	But by some unlooked accident cut off!
         
         GLOUCESTER	Have done thy charm, thou hateful withered hag!
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
         	If heaven have any grievous plague in store
         	Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
         	O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
         	And then hurl down their indignation
         	On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
         	The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
         	Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
         	And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
         	No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
         	Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
         	Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
         	Thou elvish-marked, abortive, rooting hog!
         	Thou that wast sealed in thy nativity
         	The slave of nature and the son of hell!
         	Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
         	Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
         	Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
         
         GLOUCESTER	Margaret.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	        Richard!
         
         GLOUCESTER	                  Ha!
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	                  I call thee not.
         
         GLOUCESTER	I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
         	That thou hadst called me all these bitter names.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Why, so I did; but looked for no reply.
         	O, let me make the period to my curse!
         
         GLOUCESTER	'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
         	Why strewest thou sugar on that bottled spider,
         	Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
         	Fool, fool! thou whetest a knife to kill thyself.
         	The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
         	To help thee curse that poisonous bunchbacked toad.
         
         HASTINGS	False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
         	Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
         
         RIVERS	Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
         	Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
         	O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
         
         DORSET	Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
         	Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
         	O, that your young nobility could judge
         	What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
         	They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
         	And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
         
         DORSET	It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
         	Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
         	And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
         	Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
         	Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
         	Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
         	Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
         	O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
         	As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
         	Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
         	And shamefully by you my hopes are butchered.
         	My charity is outrage, life my shame
         	And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Have done, have done.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
         	In sign of league and amity with thee:
         	Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
         	Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
         	Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Nor no one here; for curses never pass
         	The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
         	And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
         	O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
         	Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
         	His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
         	Have not to do with him, beware of him;
         	Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
         	And all their ministers attend on him.
         
         GLOUCESTER	What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
         	And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
         	O, but remember this another day,
         	When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
         	And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
         	Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
         	And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         HASTINGS	My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
         
         RIVERS	And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
         
         GLOUCESTER	I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
         	She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
         	My part thereof that I have done to her.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	I never did her any, to my knowledge.
         
         GLOUCESTER	But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
         	I was too hot to do somebody good,
         	That is too cold in thinking of it now.
         	Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
         	He is franked up to fatting for his pains
         	God pardon them that are the cause of it!
         
         RIVERS	A virtuous and a Christian- conclusion,
         	To pray for them that have done scathe to us.

         	[Aside]
         
         	being well-advised.

         	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]
         
         GLOUCESTER	I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
         	The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
         	I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
         	Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
         	I do beweep to many simple gulls
         	Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
         	And say it is the queen and her allies
         	That stir the king against the duke my brother.
         	Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
         	To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
         	But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
         	Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
         	And thus I clothe my naked villany
         	With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
         	And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
         
         	[Enter two Murderers]
         
         	But, soft! here come my executioners.
         	How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
         	Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
         
         First Murderer	We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
         	That we may be admitted where he is.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
         
         	[Gives the warrant]
         
         	When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
         	But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
         	Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
         	For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
         	May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
         
         First Murderer	Tush!
         	Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
         	Talkers are no good doers: be assured
         	We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:

         	[Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY]
         
         BRAKENBURY	Why looks your grace so heavily today?
         
         CLARENCE	O, I have passed a miserable night,
         	So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
         	That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
         	I would not spend another such a night,
         	Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
         	So full of dismal terror was the time!
         
         BRAKENBURY	What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
         
         CLARENCE	Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
         	And was embarked to cross to Burgundy;
         	And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
         	Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
         	Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
         	And cited up a thousand fearful times,
         	During the wars of York and Lancaster
         	That had befall'n us. As we paced along
         	Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
         	Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
         	Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
         	Into the tumbling billows of the main.
         	Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
         	What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
         	What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
         	Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
         	Ten thousand men that fishes gnawed upon;
         	Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
         	Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
         	All scattered in the bottom of the sea:
         	Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
         	Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
         	As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
         	Which wooed the slimy bottom of the deep,
         	And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.
         
         BRAKENBURY	Had you such leisure in the time of death
         	To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
         
         CLARENCE	Methought I had; and often did I strive
         	To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
         	Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
         	To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
         	But smothered it within my panting bulk,
         	Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
         
         BRAKENBURY	Awaked you not with this sore agony?
         
         CLARENCE	O, no, my dream was lengthened after life;
         	O, then began the tempest to my soul,
         	Who passed, methought, the melancholy flood,
         	With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
         	Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
         	The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
         	Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
         	Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
         	Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
         	And so he vanished: then came wandering by
         	A shadow  an angel, with bright hair
         	Dabbled in blood; and he squeaked out aloud,
         	'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
         	That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury;
         	Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
         	With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
         	Environed me about, and howled in mine ears
         	Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
         	I trembling waked, and for a season after
         	Could not believe but that I was in hell,
         	Such terrible impression made the dream.
         
         BRAKENBURY	No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
         	I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
         
         CLARENCE	O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
         	Which now bear evidence against my soul,
         	For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
         	O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
         	But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
         	Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
         	O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
         	I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
         	My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
         
         BRAKENBURY	I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
         
         	[CLARENCE sleeps]
         
         	Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
         	Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
         	Princes have but their tides for their glories,
         	An outward honour for an inward toil;
         	And, for unfelt imagination,
         	They often feel a world of restless cares:
         	So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
         	There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
         
         	[Enter the two Murderers]
         
         First Murderer	Ho! who's here?
         
         BRAKENBURY	In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
         
         First Murderer	I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
         
         BRAKENBURY	Yea, are you so brief?
         
         Second Murderer	O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
         	him our commission; talk no more.
         
         	[BRAKENBURY reads it]
         
         BRAKENBURY	I am, in this, commanded to deliver
         	The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
         	I will not reason what is meant hereby,
         	Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
         	Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
         	I'll to the king; and signify to him
         	That thus I have resigned my charge to you.
         
         First Murderer	Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
         
         	[Exit BRAKENBURY]
         
         Second Murderer	What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
         
         First Murderer	No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
         
         Second Murderer	When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
         	the judgment-day.
         
         First Murderer	Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
         
         Second Murderer	The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
         	of remorse in me.
         
         First Murderer	What, art thou afraid?
         
         Second Murderer	Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
         	damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
         
         First Murderer	I thought thou hadst been resolute.
         
         Second Murderer	So I am, to let him live.
         
         First Murderer	Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
         
         Second Murderer	I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
         	will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
         	would tell twenty.
         
         First Murderer	How dost thou feel thyself now?
         
         Second Murderer	'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
         	within me.
         
         First Murderer	Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
         
         Second Murderer	'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
         
         First Murderer	Where is thy conscience now?
         
         Second Murderer	In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
         
         First Murderer	So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
         	thy conscience flies out.
         
         Second Murderer	Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
         
         First Murderer	How if it come to thee again?
         
         Second Murderer	I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
         	makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
         	accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
         	he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
         	detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
         	mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
         	obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
         	that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
         	is turned out of all towns and cities for a
         	dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
         	well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
         	without it.
         
         First Murderer	'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
         	not to kill the duke.
         
         Second Murderer	Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
         	would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
         
         First Murderer	Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
         	I warrant thee.
         
         Second Murderer	Spoke  a tail fellow that respects his
         	reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
         
         First Murderer	Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
         	sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
         	in the next room.
         
         Second Murderer	O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
         
         First Murderer	Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
         
         Second Murderer	No, first let's reason with him.
         
         CLARENCE	Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
         
         Second murderer	You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
         
         CLARENCE	In God's name, what art thou?
         
         Second Murderer	A man, as you are.
         
         CLARENCE	But not, as I am, royal.
         
         Second Murderer	Nor you, as we are, loyal.
         
         CLARENCE	Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
         
         Second Murderer	My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
         
         CLARENCE	How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
         	Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
         	Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
         
         Both	To, to, to--
         
         CLARENCE	To murder me?
         
         Both	Ay, ay.
         
         CLARENCE	You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
         	And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
         	Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
         
         First Murderer	Offended us you have not, but the king.
         
         CLARENCE	I shall be reconciled to him again.
         
         Second Murderer	Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
         
         CLARENCE	Are you called forth from out a world of men
         	To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
         	Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
         	What lawful quest have given their verdict up
         	Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
         	The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
         	Before I be convict by course of law,
         	To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
         	I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
         	By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
         	That you depart and lay no hands on me
         	The deed you undertake is damnable.
         
         First Murderer	What we will do, we do upon command.
         
         Second Murderer	And he that hath commanded is the king.
         
         CLARENCE	Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
         	Hath in the tables of his law commanded
         	That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
         	Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
         	Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
         	To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
         
         Second Murderer	And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
         	For false forswearing and for murder too:
         	Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
         	To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
         
         First Murderer	And,  a traitor to the name of God,
         	Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
         	Unripedst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
         
         Second Murderer	Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
         
         First Murderer	How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
         	When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
         
         CLARENCE	Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
         	For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
         	He sends ye not to murder me for this
         	For in this sin he is as deep as I.
         	If God will be revenged for this deed.
         	O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
         	Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
         	He needs no indirect nor lawless course
         	To cut off those that have offended him.
         
         First Murderer	Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
         	When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
         	That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
         
         CLARENCE	My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
         
         First Murderer	Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
         	Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
         
         CLARENCE	Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
         	I am his brother, and I love him well.
         	If you be hired for meed, go back again,
         	And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
         	Who shall reward you better for my life
         	Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
         
         Second Murderer	You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
         
         CLARENCE	O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
         	Go you to him from me.
         
         Both	Ay, so we will.
         
         CLARENCE	Tell him, when that our princely father York
         	Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm,
         	And charged us from his soul to love each other,
         	He little thought of this divided friendship:
         	Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
         
         First Murderer	Ay, millstones; as be lessoned us to weep.
         
         CLARENCE	O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
         
         First Murderer	Right,
         	As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
         	'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
         
         CLARENCE	It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
         	He hugged me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
         	That he would labour my delivery.
         
         Second Murderer	Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
         	From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
         
         First Murderer	Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
         
         CLARENCE	Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
         	To counsel me to make my peace with God,
         	And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
         	That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
         	Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
         	To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
         
         Second Murderer	What shall we do?
         
         CLARENCE	                  Relent, and save your souls.
         
         First Murderer	Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
         
         CLARENCE	Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
         	Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
         	Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
         	if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
         	Would not entreat for life?
         	My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
         	O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
         	Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
         	As you would beg, were you in my distress
         	A begging prince what beggar pities not?
         
         Second Murderer	Look behind you, my lord.
         
         First Murderer	Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
         
         	[Stabs him]
         
         	I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
         
         	[Exit, with the body]
         
         Second Murderer	A bloody deed, and desperately dispatched!
         	How fain,  Pilate, would I wash my hands
         	Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
         
         	[Re-enter First Murderer]
         
         First Murderer	How now! what meanest thou, that thou helpest me not?
         	By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
         
         Second Murderer	I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
         	Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
         	For I repent me that the duke is slain.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         First Murderer	So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
         	Now must I hide his body in some hole,
         	Until the duke take order for his burial:
         	And when I have my meed, I must away;
         	For this will out, and here I must not stay.

         	ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM,
         	GREY, and others]
         
         KING EDWARD 	Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
         	You peers, continue this united league:
         	I every day expect an embassage
         	From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
         	And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
         	Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
         	Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
         	Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
         
         RIVERS	By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
         	And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
         
         HASTINGS	So thrive I, as I truly swear the !
         
         KING EDWARD 	Take heed you dally not before your king;
         	Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
         	Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
         	Either of you to be the other's end.
         
         HASTINGS	So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
         
         RIVERS	And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
         
         KING EDWARD 	Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
         	Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
         	You have been factious one against the other,
         	Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
         	And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
         	Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
         
         KING EDWARD 	Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.
         
         DORSET	This interchange of love, I here protest,
         	Upon my part shall be unviolable.
         
         HASTINGS	And so swear I, my lord
         
         	[They embrace]
         
         KING EDWARD 	Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
         	With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
         	And make me happy in your unity.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
         	On you or yours,
         
         	[To the Queen]
         
         	but with all duteous love
         	Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
         	With hate in those where I expect most love!
         	When I have most need to employ a friend,
         	And most assured that he is a friend
         	Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
         	Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
         	When I am cold in zeal to yours.
         
         KING EDWARD 	A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
         	is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
         	There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
         	To make the perfect period of this peace.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
         
         	[Enter GLOUCESTER]
         
         GLOUCESTER	Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
         	And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
         
         KING EDWARD 	Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
         	Brother, we done deeds of charity;
         	Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
         	Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
         
         GLOUCESTER	A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
         	Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
         	By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
         	Hold me a foe;
         	If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
         	Have aught committed that is hardly borne
         	By any in this presence, I desire
         	To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
         	'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
         	I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
         	First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
         	Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
         	Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
         	If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
         	Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
         	That without desert have frowned on me;
         	Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
         	I do not know that Englishman alive
         	With whom my soul is any jot at odds
         	More than the infant that is born to-night
         	I thank my God for my humility.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
         	I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
         	My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
         	To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Why, madam, have I offered love for this
         	To be so bouted in this royal presence?
         	Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
         
         	[They all start]
         
         	You do him injury to scorn his corse.
         
         RIVERS	Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
         
         DORSET	Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
         	But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
         
         KING EDWARD 	Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
         
         GLOUCESTER	But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
         	And that a winged Mercury did bear:
         	Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
         	That came too lag to see him buried.
         	God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
         	Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
         	Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
         	And yet go current from suspicion!
         
         	[Enter DERBY]
         
         DORSET	A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
         
         KING EDWARD 	I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.
         
         DORSET	I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
         
         KING EDWARD 	Then speak at once what is it thou demandest.
         
         DORSET	The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
         	Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
         	Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
         
         KING EDWARD 	Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
         	And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
         	My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
         	And yet his punishment was cruel death.
         	Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
         	Kneeled at my feet, and bade me be advised
         	Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
         	Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
         	The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
         	Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
         	When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
         	And said, edear brother, live, and be a king'?
         	Who told me, when we both lay in the field
         	Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
         	Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
         	All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
         	All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
         	Sinfully plucked, and not a man of you
         	Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
         	But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
         	Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
         	The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
         	You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
         	And I unjustly too, must grant it you
         	But for my brother not a man would speak,
         	Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
         	For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
         	Have been beholding to him in his life;
         	Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
         	O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
         	On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
         	Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
         	Oh, poor Clarence!
         
         	[Exeunt some with KING EDWARD  and QUEEN MARGARET]
         
         GLOUCESTER	This is the fruit of rashness! Marked you not
         	How that the guilty kindred of the queen
         	Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
         	O, they did urge it still unto the king!
         	God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
         	To comfort Edward with our company.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	We wait upon your grace.

         SCENE 	The palace.
         
         
         	[Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK, with the two children of CLARENCE]
         
         Boy	Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	No, boy.
         
         Boy	Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
         	And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
         
         Girl	Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
         	And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
         	If that our noble father be alive?
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
         	I do lament the sickness of the king.
         	As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
         	It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
         
         Boy	Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
         	The king my uncle is to blame for this:
         	God will revenge it; whom I will importune
         	With daily prayers all to that effect.
         
         Girl	And so will I.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
         	Incapable and shallow innocents,
         	You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
         
         Boy	Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
         	Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
         	Devised impeachments to imprison him :
         	And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
         	And hugged me in his arm, and kindly kissed my cheek;
         	Bade me rely on him as on my father,
         	And he would love me dearly as his child.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
         	And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
         	He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
         	Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
         
         Boy	Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Ay, boy.
         
         Boy	I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
         
         	[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her
         	ears; RIVERS, and DORSET after her]
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
         	To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
         	I'll join with black despair against my soul,
         	And to myself become an enemy.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	What means this scene of rude impatience?
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	To make an act of tragic violence:
         	Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
         	Why grow the branches now the root is withered?
         	Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
         	If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
         	That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
         	Or,  obedient subjects, follow him
         	To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
         	As I had title in thy noble husband!
         	I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
         	And lived by looking on his images:
         	But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
         	Are cracked in pieces by malignant death,
         	And I for comfort have but one false glass,
         	Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
         	Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
         	And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
         	But death hath snatched my husband from mine arms,
         	And plucked two crutches from my feeble limbs,
         	Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
         	Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
         	To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
         
         Boy	Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
         	How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
         
         Girl	Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned;
         	Your widow-dolour wise be unwept!
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Give me no help in lamentation;
         	I am not barren to bring forth complaints
         	All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
         	That I, being governed by the watery moon,
         	May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
         	Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
         
         Children	Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
         
         Children	What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Was never widow had so dear a loss!
         
         Children	Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Was never mother had so dear a loss!
         	Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
         	Their woes are parcelled, mine are general.
         	She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
         	I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
         	These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
         	I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
         	Alas, you three, on me, threefold distressed,
         	Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
         	And I will pamper it with lamentations.
         
         DORSET	Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
         	That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
         	In common worldly things, 'tis called ungrateful,
         	With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
         	Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
         	Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
         	For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
         
         RIVERS	Madam, bethink you,  a careful mother,
         	Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
         	Let him be crowned; in him your comfort lives:
         	Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
         	And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
         
         	[Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF]
         
         GLOUCESTER	Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
         	To wail the dimming of our shining star;
         	But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
         	Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
         	I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
         	I crave your blessing.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
         	Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
         
         GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Amen; and make me die a good old man!
         	That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:
         	I marvel why her grace did leave it out.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
         	That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
         	Now cheer each other in each other's love
         	Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
         	We are to reap the harvest of his son.
         	The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
         	But lately splintered, knit, and joined together,
         	Must gently be preserved, cherished, and kept:
         	Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
         	Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetched
         	Hither to London, to be crowned our king.
         
         RIVERS	Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
         	The new-healed wound of malice should break out,
         	Which would be so much the more dangerous
         	By how much the estate is green and yet ungoverned:
         	Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
         	And may direct his course as please himself,
         	As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
         	In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
         
         GLOUCESTER	I hope the king made peace with all of us
         	And the compact is firm and true in me.
         
         RIVERS	And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
         	Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
         	To no apparent lihood of breach,
         	Which haply by much company might be urged:
         	Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
         	That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
         
         HASTINGS	And so say I.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Then be it so; and go we to determine
         	Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
         	Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
         	To give your censures in this weighty business?

         	Hear you the news abroad?
         
         First Citizen	Ay, that the king is dead.
         
         Second Citizen	Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:

         Second Citizen	Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
         
         Third Citizen	Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.

         Third Citizen	Woe to the land that's governed by a child!
         
         Second Citizen	In him there is a hope of government,
         	That in his nonage council under him,
         	And in his full and ripened years himself,
         	No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
         
         First Citizen	So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
         	Was crowned in Paris but at nine months old.
         
         Third Citizen	Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
         	For then this land was famously enriched
         	With politic grave counsel; then the king
         	Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
         
         First Citizen	Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
         
         Third Citizen	Better it were they all came by the father,
         	Or by the father there were none at all;
         	For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
         	Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
         	O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
         	And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
         	And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
         	This sickly land might solace as before.
         
         First Citizen	Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
         
         Third Citizen	When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
         	When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
         	When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
         	Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
         	All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
         	'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
         
         Second Citizen	Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
         	Ye cannot reason almost with a man
         	That looks not heavily and full of fear.
         
         Third Citizen	Before the times of change, still is it so:
         	By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
         	Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
         	The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
         	But leave it all to God. whither away?
         
         Second Citizen	Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
         
         Third Citizen	And so was I: I'll bear you company.

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	London. The palace.
         
         
         	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN
         	ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF YORK]
         
         ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
         	At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
         	To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	I long with all my heart to see the prince:
         	I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	But I hear, no; they say my son of York
         	Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
         
         YORK	Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
         
         YORK	Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
         	My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow
         	More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
         	Gloucester,
         	'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
         	And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
         	Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
         	In him that did object the same to thee;
         	He was the wretchedest thing when he was young,
         	So long a-growing and so leisurely,
         	That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
         
         ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
         
         YORK	Now, by my troth, if I had been remembered,
         	I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
         	To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
         
         YORK	Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
         	That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
         	'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
         	Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
         
         YORK	Grandam, his nurse.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
         
         YORK	If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
         
         ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Good madam, be not angry with the child.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Pitchers have ears.
         
         	[Enter a Messenger]
         
         ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Here comes a messenger. What news?
         
         Messenger	Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	How fares the prince?
         
         Messenger	Well, madam, and in health.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	What is thy news then?
         
         Messenger	Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
         	With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Who hath committed them?
         
         Messenger	The mighty dukes
         	Gloucester and Buckingham.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	For what offence?
         
         Messenger	The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
         	Why or for what these nobles were committed
         	Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
         	The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
         	Insulting tyranny begins to jet
         	Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
         	Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
         	I see, as in a map, the end of all.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
         	How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
         	My husband lost his life to get the crown;
         	And often up and down my sons were tossed,
         	For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
         	And being seated, and domestic broils
         	Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
         	Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
         	Self against self: O, preposterous
         	And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
         	Or let me die, to look on death no more!
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
         	Madam, farewell.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	                  I'll go along with you.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	You have no cause.
         
         ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	                  My gracious lady, go;
         	And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
         	For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
         	The seal I keep: and so betide to me
         	As well I tender you and all of yours!
         	Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.

         SCENE I	London. A street.
         
         
         	[The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD,
         	GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others]
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
         	The weary way hath made you melancholy.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
         	Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
         	I want more uncles here to welcome me.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
         	Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
         	Nor more can you distinguish of a man
         	Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
         	Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
         	Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
         	Your grace attended to their sugared words,
         	But looked not on the poison of their hearts :
         	God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
         
         GLOUCESTER	My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
         
         	[Enter the Lord Mayor and his train]
         
         Lord Mayor	God bless your grace with health and happy days!
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
         	I thought my mother, and my brother York,
         	Would long ere this have met us on the way
         	Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
         	To tell us whether they will come or no!
         
         	[Enter HASTINGS]
         
         BUCKINGHAM	And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
         
         HASTINGS	On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
         	The queen your mother, and your brother York,
         	Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
         	Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
         	But by his mother was perforce withheld.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
         	Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
         	Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
         	Unto his princely brother presently?
         	If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
         	And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
         
         CARDINAL	My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
         	Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
         	Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
         	To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
         	We should infringe the holy privilege
         	Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
         	Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
         	Too ceremonious and traditional
         	Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
         	You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
         	The benefit thereof is always granted
         	To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
         	And those who have the wit to claim the place:
         	This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it;
         	And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
         	Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
         	You break no privilege nor charter there.
         	Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
         	But sanctuary children never till now.
         
         CARDINAL	My lord, you shall over-rule my mind for once.
         	Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
         
         HASTINGS	I go, my lord.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
         
         	[Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS]
         
         	Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
         	Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
         
         GLOUCESTER	Where it seems best unto your royal self.
         	If I may counsel you, some day or two
         	Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
         	Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
         	For your best health and recreation.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	I do not  the Tower, of any place.
         	Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
         	Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	Is it upon record, or else reported
         	Successively from age to age, he built it?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Upon record, my gracious lord.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	But say, my lord, it were not registered,
         	Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
         	As 'twere retailed to all posterity,
         	Even to the general all-ending day.
         
         GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never
         	live long.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	What say you, uncle?
         
         GLOUCESTER	I say, without characters, fame lives long.
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	Thus,  the formal vice, Iniquity,
         	I moralize two meanings in one word.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
         	With what his valour did enrich his wit,
         	His wit set down to make his valour live
         	Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
         	For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
         	I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
         
         BUCKINGHAM	What, my gracious lord?
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	An if I live until I be a man,
         	I'll win our ancient right in France again,
         	Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
         
         GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
         
         	[Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL]
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
         
         YORK	Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
         	Too late he died that might have kept that title,
         	Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
         
         GLOUCESTER	How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
         
         YORK	I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
         	You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
         	The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
         
         GLOUCESTER	He hath, my lord.
         
         YORK	                  And therefore is he idle?
         
         GLOUCESTER	O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
         
         YORK	Then is he more beholding to you than I.
         
         GLOUCESTER	He may command me as my sovereign;
         	But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
         
         YORK	I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
         
         GLOUCESTER	My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	A beggar, brother?
         
         YORK	Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
         	And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
         
         GLOUCESTER	A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
         
         YORK	A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
         
         GLOUCESTER	A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
         
         YORK	O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
         	In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
         
         GLOUCESTER	It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
         
         YORK	I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
         
         GLOUCESTER	What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
         
         YORK	I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
         
         GLOUCESTER	How?
         
         YORK	Little.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
         	Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
         
         YORK	You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
         	Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
         	Because that I am little,  an ape,
         	He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
         	To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
         	He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
         	So cunning and so young is wonderful.
         
         GLOUCESTER	My lord, will't please you pass along?
         	Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
         	Will to your mother, to entreat of her
         	To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
         
         YORK	What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	My lord protector needs will have it so.
         
         YORK	I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Why, what should you fear?
         
         YORK	Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
         	My grandam told me he was murdered there.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	I fear no uncles dead.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Nor none that live, I hope.
         
         PRINCE EDWARD	An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
         	But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
         	Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
         
         	[A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM
         	and CATESBY]
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Think you, my lord, this little prating York
         	Was not incensed by his subtle mother
         	To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
         
         GLOUCESTER	No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
         	Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
         	He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
         	Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
         	As closely to conceal what we impart:
         	Thou knowest our reasons urged upon the way;
         	What thinkest thou? is it not an easy matter
         	To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
         	For the instalment of this noble duke
         	In the seat royal of this famous isle?
         
         CATESBY	He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
         	That he will not be won to aught against him.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	What thinkest thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
         
         CATESBY	He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
         	And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
         	How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
         	And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
         	To sit about the coronation.
         	If thou dost find him tractable to us,
         	Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
         	If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
         	Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
         	And give us notice of his inclination:
         	For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
         	Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
         	His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
         	To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
         	And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
         	Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
         
         CATESBY	My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
         
         CATESBY	You shall, my lord.
         
         GLOUCESTER	At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
         
         	[Exit CATESBY]
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
         	Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
         
         GLOUCESTER	Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
         	And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
         	The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
         	Whereof the king my brother stood possessed.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
         
         GLOUCESTER	And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
         	Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
         	We may digest our complots in some form.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	Before Lord Hastings' house.
         
         
         	[Enter a Messenger]
         
         Messenger	What, ho! my lord!
         
         HASTINGS	[Within]  Who knocks at the door?
         
         Messenger	A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
         
         	[Enter HASTINGS]
         
         HASTINGS	What is't o'clock?
         
         Messenger	Upon the stroke of four.
         
         HASTINGS	Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
         
         Messenger	So it should seem by that I have to say.
         	First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
         
         HASTINGS	And then?
         
         Messenger	And then he sends you word
         	He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
         	Besides, he says there are two councils held;
         	And that may be determined at the one
         	which may make you and him to rue at the other.
         	Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
         	If presently you will take horse with him,
         	And with all speed post with him toward the north,
         	To shun the danger that his soul divines.
         
         HASTINGS	Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
         	Bid him not fear the separated councils
         	His honour and myself are at the one,
         	And at the other is my servant Catesby
         	Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
         	Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
         	Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
         	And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
         	To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
         	To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
         	Were to incense the boar to follow us
         	And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
         	Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
         	And we will both together to the Tower,
         	Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
         
         Messenger	My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         	[Enter CATESBY]
         
         CATESBY	Many good morrows to my noble lord!
         
         HASTINGS	Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
         	What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
         
         CATESBY	It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
         	And I believe twill never stand upright
         	Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
         
         HASTINGS	How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
         
         CATESBY	Ay, my good lord.
         
         HASTINGS	I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
         	Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
         	But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
         
         CATESBY	Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
         	Upon his party for the gain thereof:
         	And thereupon he sends you this good news,
         	That this same very day your enemies,
         	The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
         
         HASTINGS	Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
         	Because they have been still mine enemies:
         	But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
         	To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
         	God knows I will not do it, to the death.
         
         CATESBY	God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
         
         HASTINGS	But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
         	That they who brought me in my master's hate
         	I live to look upon their tragedy.
         	I tell thee, Catesby--
         
         CATESBY	What, my lord?
         
         HASTINGS	Ere a fortnight make me elder,
         	I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
         
         CATESBY	'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
         	When men are unprepared and look not for it.
         
         HASTINGS	O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
         	With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
         	With some men else, who think themselves as safe
         	As thou and I; who, as thou knowest, are dear
         	To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
         
         CATESBY	The princes both make high account of you;
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	For they account his head upon the bridge.
         
         HASTINGS	I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
         
         	[Enter STANLEY]
         
         	Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
         	Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
         
         STANLEY	My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
         	You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
         	I do not  these several councils, I.
         
         HASTINGS	My lord,
         	I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
         	And never in my life, I do protest,
         	Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
         	Think you, but that I know our state secure,
         	I would be so triumphant as I am?
         
         STANLEY	The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
         	Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
         	And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
         	But yet, you see how soon the day overcast.
         	This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
         	Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
         	What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
         
         HASTINGS	Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
         	To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
         
         LORD STANLEY	They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
         	Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
         	But come, my lord, let us away.
         
         	[Enter a Pursuivant]
         
         HASTINGS	Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
         
         	[Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY]
         
         	How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
         
         Pursuivant	The better that your lordship please to ask.
         
         HASTINGS	I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
         	Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
         	Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
         	By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
         	But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
         	This day those enemies are put to death,
         	And I in better state than ever I was.
         
         Pursuivant	God hold it, to your honour's good content!
         
         HASTINGS	Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
         
         	[Throws him his purse]
         
         Pursuivant	God save your lordship!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         	[Enter a Priest]
         
         Priest	Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
         
         HASTINGS	I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
         	I am in your debt for your last exercise;
         	Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
         
         	[He whispers in his ear]
         
         	[Enter BUCKINGHAM]
         
         BUCKINGHAM	What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
         	Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
         	Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
         
         HASTINGS	Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
         	Those men you talk of came into my mind.
         	What, go you toward the Tower?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
         	I shall return before your lordship thence.
         
         HASTINGS	'Tis  enough, for I stay dinner there.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	[Aside]  And supper too, although thou knowest it not.
         	Come, will you go?
         
         HASTINGS	I'll wait upon your lordship.

         	GREY, and VAUGHAN to death]
         
         RATCLIFF	Come, bring forth the prisoners.
         
         RIVERS	Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
         	To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
         	For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
         
         GREY	God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
         	A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
         
         VAUGHAN	You live that shall cry woe for this after.
         
         RATCLIFF	Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
         
         RIVERS	O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
         	Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
         	Within the guilty closure of thy walls
         	Richard the second here was hacked to death;
         	And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
         	We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
         
         GREY	Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
         	For standing by when Richard stabbed her son.
         
         RIVERS	Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
         	Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
         	To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
         	And for my sister and her princely sons,
         	Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
         	Which, as thou knowest, unjustly must be spilt.
         
         RATCLIFF	Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
         
         RIVERS	Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
         	And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.

         HASTINGS	My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
         	Is, to determine of the coronation.
         	In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Are all things fitting for that royal time?
         
         DERBY	It is, and wants but nomination.
         
         BISHOP OF ELY	To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
         	Who is most inward with the royal duke?
         
         BISHOP OF ELY	Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
         	But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
         	Than I of yours;
         	Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
         	Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
         
         HASTINGS	I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
         	But, for his purpose in the coronation.
         	I have not sounded him, nor he delivered
         	His gracious pleasure any way therein:
         	But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
         	And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
         	Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
         
         	[Enter GLOUCESTER]
         
         BISHOP OF ELY	Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
         
         GLOUCESTER	My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
         	I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
         	My absence doth neglect no great designs,
         	Which by my presence might have been concluded.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
         	William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
         	I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
         	His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
         
         HASTINGS	I thank your grace.
         
         GLOUCESTER	My lord of Ely!

         GLOUCESTER	When I was last in Holborn,
         	I saw good strawberries in your garden there
         	I do beseech you send for some of them.
         
         BISHOP OF ELY	Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
         
         	[Exit]

         DERBY	We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
         	To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
         	For I myself am not so well provided
         	As else I would be, were the day prolonged.

         HASTINGS	His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
         	There's some conceit or other s him well,
         	When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
         	I think there's never a man in Christendom
         	That can less hide his love or hate than he;
         	For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
         
         DERBY	What of his heart perceive you in his face
         	By any lihood he showed to-day?
         
         HASTINGS	Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
         	For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
         
         DERBY	I pray God he be not, I say.

         	Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevailed
         	Upon my body with their hellish charms?
         
         HASTINGS	The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
         	Makes me most forward in this noble presence
         	To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
         	I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
         	See how I am bewitched; behold mine arm
         	Is,  a blasted sapling, withered up:
         	And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
         	Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
         	That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
         
         HASTINGS	If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
         
         GLOUCESTER	If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
         	Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
         	Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
         	I will not dine until I see the same.
         	Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
         	The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
         
         	[Exeunt all but HASTINGS, RATCLIFF, and LOVEL]
         
         HASTINGS	Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
         	For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
         	Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
         	But I disdained it, and did scorn to fly:
         	Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
         	And startled, when he looked upon the Tower,
         	As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
         	O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
         	I now repent I told the pursuivant
         	As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
         	How they at Pomfret bloodily were butchered,
         	And I myself secure in grace and favour.
         	O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
         	Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
         
         RATCLIFF	Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
         	Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
         
         HASTINGS	O momentary grace of mortal men,
         	Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
         	Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
         	Lives  a drunken sailor on a mast,
         	Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
         	Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
         
         LOVEL	Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
         
         HASTINGS	O bloody Richard! miserable England!
         	I prophesy the fearfulest time to thee
         	That ever wretched age hath looked upon.
         	Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
         	They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         	[Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour,
         	marvellous ill-favoured]
         
         GLOUCESTER	Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
         	Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
         	And then begin again, and stop again,
         	As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
         	Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
         	Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
         	Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
         	Are at my service,  enforced smiles;
         	And both are ready in their offices,
         	At any time, to grace my stratagems.
         	But what, is Catesby gone?
         
         GLOUCESTER	He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
         
         	[Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY]
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Lord mayor,--
         
         GLOUCESTER	Look to the drawbridge there!
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Hark! a drum.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Catesby, overlook the walls.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--
         
         GLOUCESTER	Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	God and our innocency defend and guard us!
         
         GLOUCESTER	Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
         
         	[Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head]
         
         LOVEL	Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
         	The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
         
         GLOUCESTER	So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
         	I took him for the plainest harmless creature
         	That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
         	Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
         	The history of all her secret thoughts:
         	So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue,
         	That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
         	I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
         	He lived from all attainder of suspect.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Well, well, he was the covertest sheltered traitor
         	That ever lived.
         	Would you imagine, or almost believe,
         	Were't not that, by great preservation,
         	We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
         	This day had plotted, in the council-house
         	To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
         
         Lord Mayor	What, had he so?
         
         GLOUCESTER	What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
         	Or that we would, against the form of law,
         	Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
         	But that the extreme peril of the case,
         	The peace of England and our persons' safety,
         	Enforced us to this execution?
         
         Lord Mayor	Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
         	And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
         	To warn false traitors from the  attempts.
         	I never looked for better at his hands,
         	After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Yet had not we determined he should die,
         	Until your lordship came to see his death;
         	Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
         	Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
         	Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
         	The traitor speak, and timorously confess
         	The manner and the purpose of his treason;
         	That you might well have signified the same
         	Unto the citizens, who haply may
         	Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
         
         Lord Mayor	But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
         	As well as I had seen and heard him speak
         	And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
         	But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
         	With all your just proceedings in this cause.
         
         GLOUCESTER	And to that end we wished your lord-ship here,
         	To avoid the carping censures of the world.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	But since you come too late of our intents,
         	Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
         	And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
         
         	[Exit Lord Mayor]
         
         GLOUCESTER	Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
         	The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
         	There, at your meetest advantage of the time,
         	Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
         	Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
         	Only for saying he would make his son
         	Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
         	Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
         	Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
         	And bestial appetite in change of lust;
         	Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
         	Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
         	Without control, listed to make his prey.
         	Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
         	Tell them, when that my mother went with child
         	Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
         	My princely father then had wars in France
         	And, by just computation of the time,
         	Found that the issue was not his begot;
         	Which well appeared in his lineaments,
         	Being nothing  the noble duke my father:
         	But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
         	Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
         	As if the golden fee for which I plead
         	Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
         
         GLOUCESTER	If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
         	Where you shall find me well accompanied
         	With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	I go: and towards three or four o'clock
         	Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
         
         	[Exit BUCKINGHAM]
         
         GLOUCESTER	Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
         
         	[To CATESBY]
         
         	Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
         	Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
         
         	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]
         
         	Now will I in, to take some privy order,
         	To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
         	And to give notice, that no manner of person
         	At any time have recourse unto the princes.

         	[Enter a Scrivener, with a paper in his hand]
         
         Scrivener	This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
         	Which in a set hand fairly is engrossed,
         	That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
         	And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
         	Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
         	For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
         	The precedent was full as long a-doing:
         	And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
         	Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
         	Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
         	That seeth not this palpable device?
         	Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
         	Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
         	When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.

         	[Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors]
         
         GLOUCESTER	How now, my lord, what say the citizens?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
         	The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Touched you the bastardy of Edward's children?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
         	And his contract by deputy in France;
         	The insatiate greediness of his desires,
         	And his enforcement of the city wives;
         	His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
         	As being got, your father then in France,
         	His resemblance, being not  the duke;
         	Withal I did infer your lineaments,
         	Being the right idea of your father,
         	Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
         	Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
         	Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
         	Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
         	Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
         	Untouched, or slightly handled, in discourse
         	And when mine oratory grew to an end
         	I bid them that did love their country's good
         	Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
         
         GLOUCESTER	Ah! and did they so?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
         	But,  dumb statues or breathing stones,
         	Gazed each on other, and looked deadly pale.
         	Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
         	And asked the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
         	His answer was, the people were not wont
         	To be spoke to but by the recorder.
         	Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
         	'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferred;'
         	But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
         	When he had done, some followers of mine own,
         	At the lower end of the hall, hurled up their caps,
         	And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
         	And thus I took the vantage of those few,
         	'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
         	'This general applause and loving shout
         	Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
         	And even here brake off, and came away.
         
         GLOUCESTER	What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	No, by my troth, my lord.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
         	Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
         	And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
         	And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
         	For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
         	And be not easily won to our request:
         	Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
         
         GLOUCESTER	I go; and if you plead as well for them
         	As I can say nay to thee for myself,
         	No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
         
         	[Exit GLOUCESTER]
         
         	[Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens]
         
         	Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
         	I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
         
         	[Enter CATESBY]
         
         	Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
         	What says he?
         
         CATESBY	             My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
         	To visit him to-morrow or next day:
         	He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
         	Divinely bent to meditation;
         	And no worldly suit would he be moved,
         	To draw him from his holy exercise.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
         	Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
         	In deep designs and matters of great moment,
         	No less importing than our general good,
         	Are come to have some conference with his grace.
         
         CATESBY	I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
         	He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
         	But on his knees at meditation;
         	Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
         	But meditating with two deep divines;
         	Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
         	But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
         	Happy were England, would this gracious prince
         	Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
         	But, sure, I fear, we shall never win him to it.
         
         Lord Mayor	Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!
         
         BUCKINGHAM	I fear he will.
         
         	[Re-enter CATESBY]
         
         	How now, Catesby, what says your lord?
         
         CATESBY	My lord,
         	He wonders to what end you have assembled
         	Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
         	His grace not being warned thereof before:
         	My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Sorry I am my noble cousin should
         	Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
         	By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
         	And so once more return and tell his grace.
         
         	[Exit CATESBY]
         
         	When holy and devout religious men
         	Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
         	So sweet is zealous contemplation.
         
         	[Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops.
         	CATESBY returns]
         
         Lord Mayor	See, where he stands between two clergymen!
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
         	To stay him from the fall of vanity:
         	And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
         	True ornaments to know a holy man.
         	Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
         	Lend favourable ears to our request;
         	And pardon us the interruption
         	Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
         
         GLOUCESTER	My lord, there needs no such apology:
         	I rather do beseech you pardon me,
         	Who, earnest in the service of my God,
         	Neglect the visitation of my friends.
         	But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
         	And all good men of this ungoverned isle.
         
         GLOUCESTER	I do suspect I have done some offence
         	That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
         	And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
         	At our entreaties, to amend that fault!
         
         GLOUCESTER	Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Then know, it is your fault that you resign
         	The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
         	The sceptered office of your ancestors,
         	Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
         	The lineal glory of your royal house,
         	To the corruption of a blemished stock:
         	Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
         	Which here we waken to our country's good,
         	This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
         	Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
         	Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
         	And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf
         	Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
         	Which to recure, we heartily solicit
         	Your gracious self to take on you the charge
         	And kingly government of this your land,
         	Not as protector, steward, substitute,
         	Or lowly factor for another's gain;
         	But as successively from blood to blood,
         	Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
         	For this, consorted with the citizens,
         	Your very worshipful and loving friends,
         	And by their vehement instigation,
         	In this just suit come I to move your grace.
         
         GLOUCESTER	I know not whether to depart in silence,
         	Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
         	Best fitteth my degree or your condition
         	If not to answer, you might haply think
         	Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
         	To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
         	Which fondly you would here impose on me;
         	If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
         	So seasoned with your faithful love to me.
         	Then, on the other side, I chequeed my friends.
         	Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
         	And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
         	Definitively thus I answer you.
         	Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
         	Unmeritable shuns your high request.
         	First if all obstacles were cut away,
         	And that my path were even to the crown,
         	As my ripe revenue and due by birth
         	Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
         	So mighty and so many my defects,
         	As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
         	Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
         	Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
         	And in the vapour of my glory smothered.
         	But, God be thanked, there's no need of me,
         	And much I need to help you, if need were;
         	The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
         	Which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time,
         	Will well become the seat of majesty,
         	And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
         	On him I lay what you would lay on me,
         	The right and fortune of his happy stars;
         	Which God defend that I should wring from him!
         
         BUCKINGHAM	My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
         	But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
         	All circumstances well considered.
         	You say that Edward is your brother's son:
         	So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
         	For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
         	Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
         	And afterward by substitute betrothed
         	To Bona, sister to the King of France.
         	These both put by a poor petitioner,
         	A care-crazed mother of a many children,
         	A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
         	Even in the afternoon of her best days,
         	Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
         	Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
         	To base declension and loathed bigamy
         	By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
         	This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
         	More bitterly could I expostulate,
         	Save that, for reverence to some alive,
         	I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
         	Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
         	This proffered benefit of dignity;
         	If non to bless us and the land withal,
         	Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
         	From the corruption of abusing times,
         	Unto a lineal true-derived course.
         
         Lord Mayor	Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.
         
         CATESBY	O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
         
         GLOUCESTER	Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
         	I am unfit for state and majesty;
         	I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
         	I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
         	Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
         	As well we know your tenderness of heart
         	And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
         	Which we have noted in you to your kin,
         	And egally indeed to all estates,--
         	Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
         	Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
         	But we will plant some other in the throne,
         	To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
         	And in this resolution here we leave you.--
         	Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.
         
         GLOUCESTER	O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
         
         	[Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens]
         
         CATESBY	Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.
         
         ANOTHER	Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Would you enforce me to a world of care?
         	Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
         	But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
         	Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
         
         	[Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest]
         
         	Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
         	Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
         	To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
         	I must have patience to endure the load:
         	But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
         	Attend the sequel of your imposition,
         	Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
         	From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
         	For God he knows, and you may partly see,
         	How far I am from the desire thereof.
         
         Lord Mayor	God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
         
         GLOUCESTER	In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Then I salute you with this kingly title:
         	Long live Richard, England's royal king!

         GLOUCESTER	Even when you please, since you will have it so.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
         	And so most joyfully we take our leave.
         
         GLOUCESTER	Come, let us to our holy task again.

         DUCHESS OF YORK	Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
         	Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
         	Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
         	On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
         	Daughter, well met.

         LADY ANNE	No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
         	Upon the  devotion as yourselves,
         	To gratulate the gentle princes there.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
         
         	[Enter BRAKENBURY]
         
         	And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
         	Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
         	How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
         
         BRAKENBURY	Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
         	I may not suffer you to visit them;
         	The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	The king! why, who's that?
         
         BRAKENBURY	I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
         	Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
         	I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
         
         LADY ANNE	Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
         	Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
         	And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
         
         BRAKENBURY	No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
         	I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.

         	And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
         
         	[To LADY ANNE]
         
         	Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
         	There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
         	May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
         	With this dead-killing news!
         
         LADY ANNE	Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
         
         DORSET	Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
         	Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
         	Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
         	If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
         	And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
         	Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
         	Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
         	And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
         	Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
         
         LORD STANLEY	Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
         	Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
         	You shall have letters from me to my son
         	To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
         	Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
         	O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
         	A cockatrice hast thou hatched to the world,
         	Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
         
         LORD STANLEY	Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
         
         LADY ANNE	And I in all unwillingness will go.
         	I would to God that the inclusive verge
         	Of golden metal that must round my brow
         	Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
         	Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
         	And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
         	To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
         
         LADY ANNE	No! why?  When he that is my husband now
         	Came to me, as I followed Henry's corse,
         	When scarce the blood was well washed from his hands
         	Which issued from my other angel husband
         	And that dead saint which then I weeping followed;
         	O, when, I say, I looked on Richard's face,
         	This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
         	For making me, so young, so old a widow!
         	And, when thou wedest, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
         	And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
         	As miserable by the life of thee
         	As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
         	Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
         	Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
         	Grossly grew captive to his honey words
         	And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
         	Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
         	For never yet one hour in his bed
         	Have I enjoyed the golden dew of sleep,
         	But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
         	Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
         	And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
         
         LADY ANNE	No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!
         
         LADY ANNE	Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	[To DORSET]

         	Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
         	I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
         	Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
         	And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
         	Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
         	Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
         	Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
         	Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
         	For tender princes, use my babies well!
         	So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

         	Look, how thou dreamest! I say again, give out
         	That Anne my wife is sick and  to die:
         	About it; for it stands me much upon,

         	Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
         	Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
         	Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
         	So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
         	Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.

         	Is thy name Tyrrel?
         
         TYRREL	James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Art thou, indeed?
         
         TYRREL	           Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
         
         TYRREL	Ay, my lord;
         	But I had rather kill two enemies.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
         	Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
         	Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
         	Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
         
         TYRREL	Let me have open means to come to them,
         	And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Thou singest sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
         	Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
         
         	[Whispers]
         
         	There is no more but so: say it is done,
         	And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.
         
         TYRREL	'Tis done, my gracious lord.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
         
         TYRREL	Ye shall, my Lord.

         	[Re-enter BUCKINGHAM]
         
         BUCKINGHAM	My Lord, I have considered in my mind
         	The late demand that you did sound me in.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	I hear that news, my lord.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
         	For which your honour and your faith is pawned;
         	The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
         	The which you promised I should possess.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
         	Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	What says your highness to my just demand?
         
         KING RICHARD I	As I remember, Henry the Sixth
         	Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
         	When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
         	A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
         
         BUCKINGHAM	My lord!
         
         KING RICHARD I	How chance the prophet could not at that time
         	Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	My lord, your promise for the earldom,--
         
         KING RICHARD I	Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
         	The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle,
         	And called it Rougemont: at which name I started,
         	Because a bard of Ireland told me once
         	I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	My Lord!
         
         KING RICHARD I	       Ay, what's o'clock?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
         	Of what you promised me.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Well, but what's o'clock?
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Upon the stroke of ten.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Well, let it strike.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Why let it strike?
         
         KING RICHARD I	Because that,  a Jack, thou keepest the stroke
         	Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
         	I am not in the giving vein to-day.
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Tut, tut,
         	Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
         
         	[Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM]
         
         BUCKINGHAM	Is it even so? rewards he my true service
         	With such deep contempt made I him king for this?

         	To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!

         	[Enter TYRREL]
         
         TYRREL	The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
         	The most arch of piteous massacre
         	That ever yet this land was guilty of.
         	Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
         	To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
         	Although they were fleshed villains, bloody dogs,
         	Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
         	Wept  two children in their deaths' sad stories.
         	'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
         	'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
         	Within their innocent alabaster arms:
         	Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
         	Which in their summer beauty kissed each other.
         	A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
         	Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
         	But O! the devil'--there the villain stopped
         	Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
         	The most replenished sweet work of nature,
         	That from the prime creation ever she framed.'
         	Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
         	They could not speak; and so I left them both,
         	To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
         	And here he comes.
         
         	[Enter KING RICHARD I]
         
         	All hail, my sovereign liege!
         
         KING RICHARD I	Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
         
         TYRREL	If to have done the thing you gave in charge
         	Beget your happiness, be happy then,
         	For it is done, my lord.
         
         KING RICHARD I	But didst thou see them dead?
         
         TYRREL	I did, my lord.
         
         KING RICHARD I	                 And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
         
         TYRREL	The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
         	But how or in what place I do not know.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
         	And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
         	Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
         	And be inheritor of thy desire.
         	Farewell till soon.

         	The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
         	His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage;
         	The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
         	And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
         	Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
         	At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
         	And, by that knot, looks proudly over the crown,
         	To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.

         CATESBY	Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
         	And Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen,
         	Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
         	Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
         	Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
         	Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
         	Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
         	Then fiery expedition be my wing,
         	Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!

         	To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
         	A dire induction am I witness to,
         	And will to France, hoping the consequence
         	Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
         	Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
         
         	[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK]

         	If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
         	And be not fixed in doom perpetual,
         	Hover about me with your airy wings
         	And hear your mother's lamentation!
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Hover about her; say, that right for right
         	Hath dimmed your infant morn to aged night.

         	And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
         	When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

         	As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
         	Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
         	O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
         
         	[Sitting down by her]
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
         	Give mine the benefit of seniory,
         	And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
         	If sorrow can admit society,
         
         	[Sitting down with them]
         
         	Tell over your woes again by viewing mine:
         	I had an Edward, till a Richard killed him;
         	I had a Harry, till a Richard killed him:
         	Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard killed him;
         	Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
         	I had a Rutland too, thou holpest to kill him.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him.
         	From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
         	A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
         	That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
         	To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
         	That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
         	That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
         	That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
         	Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
         	O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
         	How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
         	Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
         	And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
         	God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
         	And now I cloy me with beholding it.
         	Thy Edward he is dead, that stabbed my Edward:
         	Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
         	Young York he is but boot, because both they
         	Match not the high perfection of my loss:
         	Thy Clarence he is dead that killed my Edward;
         	And the beholders of this tragic play,
         	The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
         	Untimely smothered in their dusky graves.
         	Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
         	Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
         	And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
         	Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
         	Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
         	To have him suddenly conveyed away.
         	Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
         	That I may live to say, The dog is dead!
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
         	That I should wish for thee to help me curse
         	That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad!
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	I called thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
         	I called thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
         	The presentation of but what I was;
         	The flattering index of a direful pageant;
         	One heaved a-high, to be hurled down below;
         	A mother only mocked with two sweet babes;
         	A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
         	A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
         	To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
         	A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
         	Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
         	Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
         	Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
         	Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?
         	Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?
         	Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
         	For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
         	For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
         	For queen, a very caitiff crowned with care;
         	For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
         	For one that scorned at me, now scorned of me;
         	For one being feared of all, now fearing one;
         	For one commanding all, obeyed of none.
         	Thus hath the course of justice wheeled about,
         	And left thee but a very prey to time;
         	Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
         	To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
         	Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
         	Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
         	Now thy proud neck bears half my burthened yoke;
         	From which even here I slip my weary neck,
         	And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
         	Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
         	These English woes will make me smile in France.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	O thou well skilled in curses, stay awhile,
         	And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
         	Compare dead happiness with living woe;
         	Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
         	And he that slew them fouler than he is:
         	Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
         	Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!
         
         QUEEN MARGARET	Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce  mine.
         
         	[Exit]

         	Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	O, let me speak!
         
         KING RICHARD I	                  Do then: but I'll not hear.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
         
         KING RICHARD I	And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Art thou so hasty? I have stayed for thee,
         	God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
         
         KING RICHARD I	And came I not at last to comfort you?
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	No, by the holy rood, thou knowest it well,
         	Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
         	A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
         	Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
         	Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
         	Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
         	Thy age confirmed, proud, subdued, bloody,
         	treacherous,
         	More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
         	What comfortable hour canst thou name,
         	That ever graced me in thy company?
         
         KING RICHARD I	Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that called
         	your grace
         	To breakfast once forth of my company.
         	If I be so disgracious in your sight,
         	Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
         	Strike the drum.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	                  I prithee, hear me speak.
         
         KING RICHARD I	You speak too bitterly.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Hear me a word;
         	For I shall never speak to thee again.
         
         KING RICHARD I	So.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
         	Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
         	Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
         	And never look upon thy face again.
         	Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
         	Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
         	Than all the complete armour that thou wearest!
         	My prayers on the adverse party fight;
         	And there the little souls of Edward's children
         	Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
         	And promise them success and victory.
         	Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
         	Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
         	Abides in me; I say amen to all.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	I have no more sons of the royal blood
         	For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
         	They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
         	And therefore level not to hit their lives.
         
         KING RICHARD I	You have a daughter called Elizabeth,
         	Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	And must she die for this? O, let her live,
         	And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
         	Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
         	Throw over her the veil of infamy:
         	So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter,
         	I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Her life is only safest in her birth.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	And only in that safety died her brothers.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
         
         KING RICHARD I	All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
         	My babes were destined to a fairer death,
         	If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life.
         
         KING RICHARD I	You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozened
         	Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
         	Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
         	Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
         	No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
         	Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
         	To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
         	But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
         	My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
         	Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes;
         	And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
         	 a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
         	Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
         	And dangerous success of bloody wars,
         	As I intend more good to you and yours,
         	Than ever you or yours were by me wronged!
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	What good is covered with the face of heaven,
         	To be discovered, that can do me good?
         
         KING RICHARD I	The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
         
         KING RICHARD I	No, to the dignity and height of honour
         	The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
         	Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
         	Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
         
         KING RICHARD I	Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
         	Will I withal endow a child of thine;
         	So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
         	Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
         	Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
         	Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
         
         KING RICHARD I	What do you think?
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
         	So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
         	And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
         	I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
         	And mean to make her queen of England.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
         
         KING RICHARD I	Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	What, thou?
         
         KING RICHARD I	I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	How canst thou woo her?
         
         KING RICHARD I	That would I learn of you,
         	As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	And wilt thou learn of me?
         
         KING RICHARD I	Madam, with all my heart.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
         	A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
         	Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
         	Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
         	Did to thy father, steeped in Rutland's blood,--
         	A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
         	The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
         	And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
         	If this inducement force her not to love,
         	Send her a story of thy noble acts;
         	Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
         	Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
         	Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
         	To win our daughter.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	There is no other way
         	Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
         	And not be Richard that hath done all this.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Say that I did all this for love of her.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
         	Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
         	Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
         	Which after hours give leisure to repent.
         	If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
         	To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
         	If I have killed the issue of your womb,
         	To quicken your increase, I will beget
         	Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
         	A grandam's name is little less in love
         	Than is the doting title of a mother;
         	They are as children but one step below,
         	Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
         	Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
         	Endured of her, for whom you bid  sorrow.
         	Your children were vexation to your youth,
         	But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
         	The loss you have is but a son being king,
         	And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
         	I cannot make you what amends I would,
         	Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
         	Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
         	Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
         	This fair alliance quickly shall call home
         	To high promotions and great dignity:
         	The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
         	Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
         	Again shall you be mother to a king,
         	And all the ruins of distressful times
         	Repaired with double riches of content.
         	What! we have many goodly days to see:
         	The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
         	Shall come again, transformed to orient pearl,
         	Advantaging their loan with interest
         	Of ten times double gain of happiness.
         	Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
         	Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
         	Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
         	Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
         	Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
         	With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
         	And when this arm of mine hath chastised
         	The petty rebel, dull-brained Buckingham,
         	Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
         	And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
         	To whom I will retail my conquest won,
         	And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	What were I best to say? her father's brother
         	Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
         	Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
         	Under what title shall I woo for thee,
         	That God, the law, my honour and her love,
         	Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
         
         KING RICHARD I	Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	To wail the tide, as her mother doth.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Say, I will love her everlastingly.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
         
         KING RICHARD I	Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
         
         KING RICHARD I	So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	So long as hell and Richard s of it.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
         	Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Profaned, dishonoured, and the third usurped.
         
         KING RICHARD I	I swear--
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	        By nothing; for this is no oath:
         	The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
         	The garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue;
         	The crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.
         	if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
         	Swear then by something that thou hast not wronged.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Now, by the world--
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
         
         KING RICHARD I	My father's death--
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thy life hath that dishonoured.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Then, by myself--
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	                  Thyself thyself misusest.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Why then, by God--
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	                  God's wrong is most of all.
         	If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him,
         	The unity the king thy brother made
         	Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
         	If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him,
         	The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
         	Had graced the tender temples of my child,
         	And both the princes had been breathing here,
         	Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
         	Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
         	What canst thou swear by now?
         
         KING RICHARD I	The time to come.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	That thou hast wronged in the time overpast;
         	For I myself have many tears to wash
         	Hereafter time, for time past wronged by thee.
         	The children live, whose parents thou hast
         	slaughtered,
         	Ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age;
         	The parents live, whose children thou hast butchered,
         	Old withered plants, to wail it with their age.
         	Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
         	Misused ere used, by time misused overpast.
         
         KING RICHARD I	As I intend to prosper and repent,
         	So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
         	Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
         	Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
         	Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
         	Be opposite all planets of good luck
         	To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
         	Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
         	I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
         	In her consists my happiness and thine;
         	Without her, follows to this land and me,
         	To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
         	Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
         	It cannot be avoided but by this;
         	It will not be avoided but by this.
         	Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
         	Be the attorney of my love to her:
         	Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
         	Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
         	Urge the necessity and state of times,
         	And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
         
         KING RICHARD I	Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I forget myself to be myself?
         
         KING RICHARD I	Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	But thou didst kill my children.
         
         KING RICHARD I	But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
         	Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
         	Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
         
         KING RICHARD I	And be a happy mother by the deed.
         
         QUEEN ELIZABETH	I go. Write to me very shortly.
         	And you shall understand from me her mind.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
         
         	[Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH]
         
         	Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
         
         	[Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following]
         
         	How now! what news?
         
         RATCLIFF	My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
         	Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
         	Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
         	Unarmed, and unresolved to beat them back:
         	'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
         	And there they hull, expecting but the aid
         	Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
         	Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
         
         CATESBY	Here, my lord.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Fly to the duke:
         
         	[To RATCLIFF]
         
         	Post thou to Salisbury
         	When thou comest thither--
         
         	[To CATESBY]
         
         		     Dull, unmindful villain,
         	Why standest thou still, and goest not to the duke?
         
         CATESBY	First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
         	What from your grace I shall deliver to him.
         
         KING RICHARD I	O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
         	The greatest strength and power he can make,
         	And meet me presently at Salisbury.
         
         CATESBY	I go.

         KING RICHARD I	Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
         
         RATCLIFF	Your highness told me I should post before.
         
         KING RICHARD I	My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
         
         	[Enter STANLEY]
         
         	How now, what news with you?
         
         STANLEY	None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
         	Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
         	Why dost thou run so many mile about,
         	When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
         	Once more, what news?
         
         STANLEY	Richmond is on the seas.
         
         KING RICHARD I	There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
         	White-livered runagate, what doth he there?
         
         STANLEY	I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?
         
         STANLEY	Stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
         	He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Is the chair empty? is the sword unswayed?
         	Is the king dead? the empire unpossessed?
         	What heir of York is there alive but we?
         	And who is England's king but great York's heir?
         	Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?
         
         STANLEY	Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
         	You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
         	Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.
         
         STANLEY	No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
         	Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
         	Are they not now upon the western shore.
         	Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!
         
         STANLEY	No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
         	When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
         
         STANLEY	They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
         	Please it your majesty to give me leave,
         	I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
         	Where and what time your majesty shall please.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
         	I will not trust you, sir.
         
         STANLEY	Most mighty sovereign,
         	You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
         	I never was nor never will be false.
         
         KING RICHARD I	Well,
         	Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
         	Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
         	Or else his head's assurance is but frail.

         	So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
         	And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
         	In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
         	Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
         	And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
         	Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
         	I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
         	With best advantage will deceive the time,
         	And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
         	But on thy side I may not be too forward
         	Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
         	Be executed in his father's sight.
         	Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
         	Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
         	And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
         	Which so long sundered friends should dwell upon:
         	God give us leisure for these rites of love!
         	Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
         
         RICHMOND	Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
         	I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
         	Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
         	When I should mount with wings of victory:
         	Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
         
         	[Exeunt all but RICHMOND]
         
         	O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
         	Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
         	Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
         	That they may crush down with a heavy fall
         	The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
         	Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
         	That we may praise thee in the victory!
         	To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
         	Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
         	Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!

         	Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
         	O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
         	The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
         	Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
         	What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
         	Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
         	Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
         	Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
         	Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
         	Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
         	That I myself have done unto myself?
         	O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
         	For hateful deeds committed by myself!
         	I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
         	Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
         	My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
         	And every tongue brings in a several tale,
         	And every tale condemns me for a villain.
         	Perjury, perjury, in the highest degree
         	Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
         	All several sins, all used in each degree,
         	Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
         	I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
         	And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
         	Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
         	Find in myself no pity to myself?
         	Methought the souls of all that I had murdered
         	Came to my tent; and every one did threat
         	To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

         	Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.
         
         KING RICHARD I	O Ratcliff, I have dreamed a fearful dream!
         	What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?

         RATCLIFF	Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
         
         KING RICHARD I	By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
         	Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
         	Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
         	Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
         	It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
         	Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
         	To see if any mean to shrink from me.

         	Have I since your departure had, my lords.
         	Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murdered,
         	Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
         	I promise you, my soul is very jocund
         	In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
         	How far into the morning is it, lords?
         
         LORDS	Upon the stroke of four.
         
         RICHMOND	Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
         
         	[His oration to his soldiers]
         
         	More than I have said, loving countrymen,
         	The leisure and enforcement of the time
         	Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
         	God and our good cause fight upon our side;
         	The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
         	 high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces;
         	Richard except, those whom we fight against
         	Had rather have us win than him they follow:
         	For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
         	A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
         	One raised in blood, and one in blood established;
         	One that made means to come by what he hath,
         	And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
         	Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
         	Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
         	One that hath ever been God's enemy:
         	Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
         	God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
         	If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
         	You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
         	If you do fight against your country's foes,
         	Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
         	If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
         	Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
         	If you do free your children from the sword,
         	Your children's children quit it in your age.
         	Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
         	Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
         	For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
         	Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
         	But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
         	The least of you shall share his part thereof.
         	Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
         	God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

         KING RICHARD I	He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
         
         RATCLIFF	He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'

         	I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
         	Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
         	More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
         	That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

         	Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:

         	In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
         	Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.

         NORFOLK	A good direction, war sovereign.

         	Conscience is but a word that cowards use,

         	Remember whom you are to cope withal;
         	A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
         	A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
         	Whom their over-cloyed country vomits forth
         	To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
         	You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
         	You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
         	They would restrain the one, distain the other.
         	And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
         	Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?
         	A milk-sop, one that never in his life
         	Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
         	Let's whip these stragglers over the seas again;
         	Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
         	These famished beggars, weary of their lives;
         	Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
         	For want of means, poor rats, had hanged themselves:
         	If we be conquered, let men conquer us,
         	And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
         	Have in their own land beaten, bobbed, and thumped,
         	And in record, left them the heirs of shame.

         	What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
         	England hath long been mad, and scarred herself;
         	The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
         	The father rashly slaughtered his own son,

         	Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
         	With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
         	Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
         	That would reduce these bloody days again,
         	And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
         	Let them not live to taste this land's increase
         	That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
         	Now civil wounds are stopped, peace lives again:

         SCENE I	Venice. A street.
         
         
         	[Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO]
         
         ANTONIO	In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
         	It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
         	But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
         	What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
         	I am to learn;
         	And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
         	That I have much ado to know myself.
         
         SALARINO	Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
         	There, where your argosies with portly sail,
         	 signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
         	Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
         	Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
         	That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
         	As they fly by them with their woven wings.
         
         SALANIO	Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
         	The better part of my affections would
         	Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
         	Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
         	Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
         	And every object that might make me fear
         	Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
         	Would make me sad.
         
         SALARINO	                  My wind cooling my broth
         	Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
         	What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
         	I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
         	But I should think of shallows and of flats,
         	And see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand,
         	Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
         	To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
         	And see the holy edifice of stone,
         	And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
         	Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
         	Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
         	Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
         	And, in a word, but even now worth this,
         	And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
         	To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
         	That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
         	But tell not me; I know, Antonio
         	Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
         
         ANTONIO	Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
         	My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
         	Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
         	Upon the fortune of this present year:
         	Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
         
         SALARINO	Why, then you are in love.
         
         ANTONIO	Fie, fie!
         
         SALARINO	Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
         	Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
         	For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
         	Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
         	Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
         	Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
         	And laugh  parrots at a bag-piper,
         	And other of such vinegar aspect
         	That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
         	Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
         
         	[Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO]
         
         SALANIO	Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
         	Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
         	We leave you now with better company.
         
         SALARINO	I would have stayed till I had made you merry,
         	If worthier friends had not prevented me.
         
         ANTONIO	Your worth is very dear in my regard.
         	I take it, your own business calls on you
         	And you embrace the occasion to depart.
         
         SALARINO	Good morrow, my good lords.
         
         BASSANIO	Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
         	You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
         
         SALARINO	We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
         
         	[Exeunt Salarino and Salanio]
         
         LORENZO	My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
         	We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
         	I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
         
         BASSANIO	I will not fail you.
         
         GRATIANO	You look not well, Signior Antonio;
         	You have too much respect upon the world:
         	They lose it that do buy it with much care:
         	Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
         
         ANTONIO	I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
         	A stage where every man must play a part,
         	And mine a sad one.
         
         GRATIANO	Let me play the fool:
         	With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
         	And let my liver rather heat with wine
         	Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
         	Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
         	Sit  his grandsire cut in alabaster?
         	Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
         	By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
         	I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
         	There are a sort of men whose visages
         	Do cream and mantle  a standing pond,
         	And do a wilful stillness entertain,
         	With purpose to be dressed in an opinion
         	Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
         	As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
         	And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
         	O my Antonio, I do know of these
         	That therefore only are reputed wise
         	For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
         	If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
         	Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
         	I'll tell thee more of this another time:
         	But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
         	For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
         	Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
         	I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
         
         LORENZO	Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
         	I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
         	For Gratiano never lets me speak.
         
         GRATIANO	Well, keep me company but two years moe,
         	Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
         
         ANTONIO	Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
         
         GRATIANO	Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
         	In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
         
         	[Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO]
         
         ANTONIO	Is that any thing now?
         
         BASSANIO	Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
         	than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
         	grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
         	shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
         	have them, they are not worth the search.
         
         ANTONIO	Well, tell me now what lady is the same
         	To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
         	That you to-day promised to tell me of?
         
         BASSANIO	'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
         	How much I have disabled mine estate,
         	By something showing a more swelling port
         	Than my faint means would grant continuance:
         	Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
         	From such a noble rate; but my chief care
         	Is to come fairly off from the great debts
         	Wherein my time something too prodigal
         	Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
         	I owe the most, in money and in love,
         	And from your love I have a warranty
         	To unburden all my plots and purposes
         	How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
         
         ANTONIO	I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
         	And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
         	Within the eye of honour, be assured,
         	My purse, my person, my extremest means,
         	Lie all unlocked to your occasions.
         
         BASSANIO	In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
         	I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
         	The self-same way with more advised watch,
         	To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
         	I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
         	Because what follows is pure innocence.
         	I owe you much, and,  a wilful youth,
         	That which I owe is lost; but if you please
         	To shoot another arrow that self way
         	Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
         	As I will watch the aim, or to find both
         	Or bring your latter hazard back again
         	And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
         
         ANTONIO	You know me well, and herein spend but time
         	To wind about my love with circumstance;
         	And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
         	In making question of my uttermost
         	Than if you had made waste of all I have:
         	Then do but say to me what I should do
         	That in your knowledge may by me be done,
         	And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.
         
         BASSANIO	In Belmont is a lady richly left;
         	And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
         	Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
         	I did receive fair speechless messages:
         	Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
         	To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
         	Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
         	For the four winds blow in from every coast
         	Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
         	Hang on her temples  a golden fleece;
         	Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
         	And many Jasons come in quest of her.
         	O my Antonio, had I but the means
         	To hold a rival place with one of them,
         	I have a mind presages me such thrift,
         	That I should questionless be fortunate!
         
         ANTONIO	Thou knowest that all my fortunes are at sea;
         	Neither have I money nor commodity
         	To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
         	Try what my credit can in Venice do:
         	That shall be racked, even to the uttermost,
         	To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
         	Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
         	Where money is, and I no question make
         	To have it of my trust or for my sake.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE : Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
         
         
         	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]
         
         PORTIA	By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
         	this great world.
         
         NERISSA	You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
         	the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
         	yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
         	with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
         	is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
         	mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
         	competency lives longer.
         
         PORTIA	Good sentences and well pronounced.
         
         NERISSA	They would be better, if well followed.
         
         PORTIA	If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
         	do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
         	cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
         	follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
         	twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
         	twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
         	devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
         	over a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
         	youth, to skip over the meshes of good counsel the
         	cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
         	choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
         	neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
         	dis; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
         	by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
         	Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?
         
         NERISSA	Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
         	death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
         	that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
         	silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
         	chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
         	rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
         	warmth is there in your affection towards any of
         	these princely suitors that are already come?
         
         PORTIA	I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
         	them, I will describe them; and, according to my
         	description, level at my affection.
         
         NERISSA	First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
         
         PORTIA	Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
         	talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
         	appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
         	shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
         	mother played false with a smith.
         
         NERISSA	Then there is the County Palatine.
         
         PORTIA	He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
         	will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
         	smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
         	philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
         	unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
         	married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
         	than to either of these. God defend me from these
         	two!
         
         NERISSA	How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
         
         PORTIA	God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
         	In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
         	he! why, he hath a horse better than the
         	Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
         	the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
         	throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
         	fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
         	should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
         	I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
         	shall never requite him.
         
         NERISSA	What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
         	of England?
         
         PORTIA	You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
         	not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
         	nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
         	swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
         	He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
         	converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
         	I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
         	hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
         	behavior every where.
         
         NERISSA	What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
         
         PORTIA	That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
         	borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
         	swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
         	think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
         	under for another.
         
         NERISSA	How  you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
         
         PORTIA	Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
         	most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
         	he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
         	when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
         	and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
         	make shift to go without him.
         
         NERISSA	If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
         	casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
         	will, if you should refuse to accept him.
         
         PORTIA	Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
         	deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
         	for if the devil be within and that temptation
         	without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
         	thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.
         
         NERISSA	You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
         	lords: they have acquainted me with their
         	determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
         	home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
         	you may be won by some other sort than your father's
         	imposition depending on the caskets.
         
         PORTIA	If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
         	chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
         	of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
         	are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
         	but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
         	them a fair departure.
         
         NERISSA	Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
         	Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
         	in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
         
         PORTIA	Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.
         
         NERISSA	True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
         	eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
         
         PORTIA	I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
         	thy praise.
         
         	[Enter a Serving-man]
         
         	How now! what news?
         
         Servant	The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
         	their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
         	fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
         	prince his master will be here to-night.
         
         PORTIA	If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
         	heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
         	be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
         	of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
         	rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
         	Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
         	Whiles we shut the gates
         	upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.

         	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Venice. A public place.
         
         
         	[Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK]
         
         SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats; well.
         
         BASSANIO	Ay, sir, for three months.
         
         SHYLOCK	For three months; well.
         
         BASSANIO	For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
         
         SHYLOCK	Antonio shall become bound; well.
         
         BASSANIO	May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
         	know your answer?
         
         SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
         
         BASSANIO	Your answer to that.
         
         SHYLOCK	Antonio is a good man.
         
         BASSANIO	Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
         
         SHYLOCK	Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
         	good man is to have you understand me that he is
         	sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
         	hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
         	Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
         	hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
         	other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
         	are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
         	and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
         	mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
         	winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
         	sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
         	take his bond.
         
         BASSANIO	Be assured you may.
         
         SHYLOCK	I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
         	I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
         
         BASSANIO	If it please you to dine with us.
         
         SHYLOCK	Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which
         	your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
         	will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
         	walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
         	with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
         	news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
         
         	[Enter ANTONIO]
         
         BASSANIO	This is Signior Antonio.
         
         SHYLOCK	[Aside]  How  a fawning publican he looks!
         	I hate him for he is a Christian,
         	But more for that in low simplicity
         	He lends out money gratis and brings down
         	The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
         	If I can catch him once upon the hip,
         	I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
         	He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
         	Even there where merchants most do congregate,
         	On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
         	Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
         	If I forgive him!
         
         BASSANIO	                  Shylock, do you hear?
         
         SHYLOCK	I am debating of my present store,
         	And, by the near guess of my memory,
         	I cannot instantly raise up the gross
         	Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
         	Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
         	Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
         	Do you desire?
         
         	[To ANTONIO]
         
         	Rest you fair, good signior;
         	Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
         
         ANTONIO	Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
         	By taking nor by giving of excess,
         	Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
         	I'll break a custom. Is he yet possessed
         	How much ye would?
         
         SHYLOCK	                  Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
         
         ANTONIO	And for three months.
         
         SHYLOCK	I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
         	Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
         	Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
         	Upon advantage.
         
         ANTONIO	                  I do never use it.
         
         SHYLOCK	When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
         	This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
         	As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
         	The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
         
         ANTONIO	And what of him? did he take interest?
         
         SHYLOCK	No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
         	Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
         	When Laban and himself were compromised
         	That all the eanlings which were streaked and pied
         	Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
         	In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
         	And, when the work of generation was
         	Between these woolly breeders in the act,
         	The skilful shepherd peeled me certain wands,
         	And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
         	He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
         	Who then conceiving did in eaning time
         	Fall parti-coloured lambs, and those were Jacob's.
         	This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
         	And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
         
         ANTONIO	This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
         	A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
         	But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.
         	Was this inserted to make interest good?
         	Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
         
         SHYLOCK	I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
         	But note me, signior.
         
         ANTONIO	Mark you this, Bassanio,
         	The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
         	An evil soul producing holy witness
         	Is  a villain with a smiling cheek,
         	A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
         	O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
         
         SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
         	Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--
         
         ANTONIO	Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
         
         SHYLOCK	Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
         	In the Rialto you have rated me
         	About my moneys and my usances:
         	Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
         	For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
         	You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
         	And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
         	And all for use of that which is mine own.
         	Well then, it now appears you need my help:
         	Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
         	'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
         	You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
         	And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
         	Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
         	What should I say to you? Should I not say
         	'Hath a dog money? is it possible
         	A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
         	Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
         	With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
         	'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
         	You spurned me such a day; another time
         	You called me dog; and for these courtesies
         	I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
         
         ANTONIO	I am as  to call thee so again,
         	To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
         	If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
         	As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
         	A breed for barren metal of his friend?
         	But lend it rather to thine enemy,
         	Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
         	Exact the penalty.
         
         SHYLOCK	                  Why, look you, how you storm!
         	I would be friends with you and have your love,
         	Forget the shames that you have stained me with,
         	Supply your present wants and take no doit
         	Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
         	This is kind I offer.
         
         
         BASSANIO	This were kindness.
         
         SHYLOCK	This kindness will I show.
         	Go with me to a notary, seal me there
         	Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
         	If you repay me not on such a day,
         	In such a place, such sum or sums as are
         	Expressed in the condition, let the forfeit
         	Be nominated for an equal pound
         	Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
         	In what part of your body pleaseth me.
         
         ANTONIO	Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
         	And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
         
         BASSANIO	You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
         	I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
         
         ANTONIO	Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
         	Within these two months, that's a month before
         	This bond expires, I do expect return
         	Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
         
         SHYLOCK	O father Abram, what these Christians are,
         	Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
         	The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
         	If he should break his day, what should I gain
         	By the exaction of the forfeiture?
         	A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
         	Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
         	As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
         	To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
         	If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
         	And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
         
         ANTONIO	Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
         
         SHYLOCK	Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
         	Give him direction for this merry bond,
         	And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
         	See to my house, left in the fearful guard
         	Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
         	I will be with you.
         
         ANTONIO	Hie thee, gentle Jew.
         
         	[Exit Shylock]
         
         	The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.

         ANTONIO	Come on: in this there can be no dismay;

         	Hath feared the valiant: by my love I swear
         	The best-regarded virgins of our clime
         	Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
         	Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
         
         PORTIA	In terms of choice I am not solely led
         	By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
         	Besides, the lottery of my destiny
         	Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
         	But if my father had not scanted me
         	And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
         	His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
         	Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
         	As any comer I have looked on yet
         	For my affection.
         
         MOROCCO	                  Even for that I thank you:
         	Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
         	To try my fortune. By this scimitar
         	That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
         	That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
         	I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
         	Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
         	Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
         	Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
         	To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
         	If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
         	Which is the better man, the greater throw
         	May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
         	So is Alcides beaten by his page;
         	And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
         	Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
         	And die with grieving.
         
         PORTIA	You must take your chance,
         	And either not attempt to choose at all
         	Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
         	Never to speak to lady afterward
         	In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
         
         MOROCCO	Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
         
         PORTIA	First, forward to the temple: after dinner
         	Your hazard shall be made.
         
         MOROCCO	Good fortune then!
         	To make me blest or cursedest among men.

         	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
         
         
         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	Venice. A street.
         
         
         	[Enter LAUNCELOT]
         
         LAUNCELOT	Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
         	this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
         	tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good
         	Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot
         	Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My
         	conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;
         	take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest
         	Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
         	heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
         	pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
         	fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
         	says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
         	hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
         	to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
         	man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,
         	indeed, my father did something smack, something
         	grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience
         	says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the
         	fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
         	'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'
         	say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
         	conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
         	who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to
         	run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
         	fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
         	himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
         	incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
         	but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
         	me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
         	friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are
         	at your command; I will run.
         
         	[Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket]
         
         GOBBO	Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way
         	to master Jew's?
         
         LAUNCELOT	[Aside]  O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!
         	who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,
         	knows me not: I will try confusions with him.
         
         GOBBO	Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way
         	to master Jew's?
         
         LAUNCELOT	Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
         	at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at
         	the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
         	down indirectly to the Jew's house.
         
         GOBBO	By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can
         	you tell me whether one Launcelot,
         	that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?
         
         LAUNCELOT	Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you
         	of young Master Launcelot?
         
         GOBBO	No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,
         	though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man
         	and, God be thanked, well to live.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of
         	young Master Launcelot.
         
         GOBBO	Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.
         
         LAUNCELOT	But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
         	talk you of young Master Launcelot?
         
         GOBBO	Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master
         	Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,
         	according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
         	sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
         	learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say
         	in plain terms, gone to heaven.
         
         GOBBO	Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my
         	age, my very prop.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Do I look  a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
         	a prop? Do you know me, father?
         
         GOBBO	Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:
         	but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his
         	soul, alive or dead?
         
         LAUNCELOT	Do you not know me, father?
         
         GOBBO	Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
         	the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
         	own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
         	your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
         	to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
         	may, but at the length truth will out.
         
         GOBBO	Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not
         	Launcelot, my boy.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but
         	give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy
         	that was, your son that is, your child that shall
         	be.
         
         GOBBO	I cannot think you are my son.
         
         LAUNCELOT	I know not what I shall think of that: but I am
         	Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your
         	wife is my mother.
         
         GOBBO	Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou
         	be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
         	Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
         	got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
         	Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
         
         LAUNCELOT	It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
         	backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail
         	than I have of my face when I last saw him.
         
         GOBBO	Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy
         	master agree? I have brought him a present. How
         	'gree you now?
         
         LAUNCELOT	Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set
         	up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I
         	have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give
         	him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
         	his service; you may tell every finger I have with
         	my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me
         	your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,
         	gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I
         	will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
         	fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I
         	am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
         
         	[Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers]
         
         BASSANIO	You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper
         	be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
         	these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,
         	and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
         
         	[Exit a Servant]
         
         LAUNCELOT	To him, father.
         
         GOBBO	God bless your worship!
         
         BASSANIO	Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?
         
         GOBBO	Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--
         
         LAUNCELOT	Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that
         	would, sir, as my father shall specify--
         
         GOBBO	He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--
         
         LAUNCELOT	Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
         	and have a desire, as my father shall specify--
         
         GOBBO	His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,
         	are scarce cater-cousins--
         
         LAUNCELOT	To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having
         	done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I
         	hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--
         
         GOBBO	I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
         	your worship, and my suit is--
         
         LAUNCELOT	In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
         	your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,
         	though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.
         
         BASSANIO	One speak for both. What would you?
         
         LAUNCELOT	Serve you, sir.
         
         GOBBO	That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
         
         BASSANIO	I know thee well; thou hast obtained thy suit:
         	Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
         	And hath preferred thee, if it be preferment
         	To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
         	The follower of so poor a gentleman.
         
         LAUNCELOT	The old proverb is very well parted between my
         	master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of
         	God, sir, and he hath enough.
         
         BASSANIO	Thou speakest it well. Go, father, with thy son.
         	Take leave of thy old master and inquire
         	My lodging out. Give him a livery
         	More guarded than his fellows': see it done.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have
         	never a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in
         	Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
         	upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,
         	here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle
         	of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven
         	widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
         	man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be
         	in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;
         	here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a
         	woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
         	come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.

         	My best-esteemed acquaintance: hie thee, go.

         GRATIANO	You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
         
         BASSANIO	Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;
         	Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
         	Parts that become thee happily enough
         	And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
         	But where thou art not known, why, there they show
         	Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
         	To allay with some cold drops of modesty
         	Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
         	I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
         	And lose my hopes.
         
         GRATIANO	                  Signior Bassanio, hear me:

         	Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
         	Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
         	Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
         	Use all the observance of civility,
         	 one well studied in a sad ostent
         	To please his grandam, never trust me more.
         
         BASSANIO	Well, we shall see your bearing.
         
         GRATIANO	Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
         	By what we do to-night.
         
         BASSANIO	No, that were pity:
         	I would entreat you rather to put on
         	Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
         	That purpose merriment. But fare you well:

         LORENZO	I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
         	And whiter than the paper it writ on
         	Is the fair hand that writ.
         
         GRATIANO	Love-news, in faith.
         
         LAUNCELOT	By your leave, sir.
         
         LORENZO	Whither goest thou?
         
         LAUNCELOT	Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
         	Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.
         
         LORENZO	Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
         	I will not fail her; speak it privately.
         	Go, gentlemen,
         
         	[Exit Launcelot]
         
         	Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
         	I am provided of a torch-bearer.
         
         SALANIO	Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
         
         SALANIO	And so will I.
         
         LORENZO	                  Meet me and Gratiano
         	At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
         
         SALARINO	'Tis good we do so.

         GRATIANO	Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
         
         LORENZO	I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
         	How I shall take her from her father's house,
         	What gold and jewels she is furnished with,
         	What page's suit she hath in readiness.
         	If ever the Jew her father come to heaven,
         	It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
         	And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
         	Unless she do it under this excuse,
         	That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
         	Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
         	Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.

         	[Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT]
         
         SHYLOCK	Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
         	The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
         	What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
         	As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
         	And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
         	Why, Jessica, I say!
         
         LAUNCELOT	Why, Jessica!
         
         SHYLOCK	Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Your worship was wont to tell me that
         	I could do nothing without bidding.
         
         	[Enter Jessica]
         
         JESSICA	Call you? what is your will?
         
         SHYLOCK	I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
         	There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
         	I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
         	But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
         	The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
         	Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
         	There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
         	For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
         
         LAUNCELOT	I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect
         	your reproach.
         
         SHYLOCK	So do I his.
         
         LAUNCELOT	An they have conspired together, I will not say you
         	shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not
         	for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
         	Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,
         	falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
         	year, in the afternoon.
         
         SHYLOCK	What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
         	Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
         	And the vile squealing of the wry-necked fife,
         	Clamber not you up to the casements then,
         	Nor thrust your head into the public street
         	To gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces,
         	But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
         	Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
         	My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
         	I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
         	But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
         	Say I will come.
         
         LAUNCELOT	I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at
         	window, for all this, There will come a Christian
         	boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.

         	Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
         	More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;
         	Therefore I part with him, and part with him
         	To one that would have him help to waste
         	His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
         	Perhaps I will return immediately:
         	Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:

         SALARINO	His hour is almost past.

         SALARINO	O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
         	To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
         	To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
         
         GRATIANO	That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
         	With that keen appetite that he sits down?
         	Where is the horse that doth untread again
         	His tedious measures with the unbated fire
         	That he did pace them first? All things that are,
         	Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed.
         	How  a younker or a prodigal
         	The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
         	Hugged and embraced by the strumpet wind!
         	How  the prodigal doth she return,
         	With over-weathered ribs and ragged sails,
         	Lean, rent and beggared by the strumpet wind!
         
         SALARINO	Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.

         LORENZO	Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
         	Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
         	When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
         	I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
         	Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
         
         	[Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes]
         
         JESSICA	Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
         	Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
         
         LORENZO	Lorenzo, and thy love.
         
         JESSICA	Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
         	For who love I so much? And now who knows
         	But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
         
         LORENZO	Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
         
         JESSICA	Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
         	I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
         	For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
         	But love is blind and lovers cannot see
         	The pretty follies that themselves commit;
         	For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
         	To see me thus transformed to a boy.
         
         LORENZO	Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
         
         JESSICA	What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
         	They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
         	Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
         	And I should be obscured.
         
         LORENZO	So are you, sweet,
         	Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
         	But come at once;
         	For the close night doth play the runaway,
         	And we are stayed for at Bassanio's feast.
         
         JESSICA	I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
         	With some more ducats, and be with you straight.

         	For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
         	And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
         	And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
         	And therefore,  herself, wise, fair and true,
         	Shall she be placed in my constant soul.

         	[Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the
         	PRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains]
         
         PORTIA	Go draw aside the curtains and discover
         	The several caskets to this noble prince.
         	Now make your choice.
         
         MOROCCO	The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
         	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
         	The second, silver, which this promise carries,
         	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
         	This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
         	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
         	How shall I know if I do choose the right?
         
         PORTIA	The one of them contains my picture, prince:
         	If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
         
         MOROCCO	Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
         	I will survey the inscriptions back again.
         	What says this leaden casket?
         	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
         	Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
         	This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
         	Do it in hope of fair advantages:
         	A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
         	I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
         	What says the silver with her virgin hue?
         	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
         	As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
         	And weigh thy value with an even hand:
         	If thou beest rated by thy estimation,
         	Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
         	May not extend so far as to the lady:
         	And yet to be afeard of my deserving
         	Were but a weak disabling of myself.
         	As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
         	I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
         	In graces and in qualities of breeding;
         	But more than these, in love I do deserve.
         	What if I strayed no further, but chose here?
         	Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
         	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
         	Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
         	From the four corners of the earth they come,
         	To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
         	The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
         	Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
         	For princes to come view fair Portia:
         	The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
         	Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
         	To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
         	As over a brook, to see fair Portia.
         	One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
         	Is't  that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
         	To think so base a thought: it were too gross
         	To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
         	Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
         	Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
         	O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
         	Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
         	A coin that bears the figure of an angel
         	Stamped in gold, but that's insculped upon;
         	But here an angel in a golden bed
         	Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
         	Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
         
         PORTIA	There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
         	Then I am yours.
         
         	[He unlocks the golden casket]
         
         MOROCCO	                  O hell! what have we here?
         	A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
         	There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	All that glitters is not gold;
         	Often have you heard that told:
         	Many a man his life hath sold
         	But my outside to behold:
         	Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
         	Had you been as wise as bold,
         	Young in limbs, in judgment old,
         	Your answer had not been inscrolled:
         	Fare you well; your suit is cold.
         	Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
         	Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
         	Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
         	To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
         
         	[Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets]
         
         PORTIA	A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.

         	[Enter SALARINO and SALANIO]
         
         SALARINO	Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
         	With him is Gratiano gone along;
         	And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
         
         SALANIO	The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
         	Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
         
         SALARINO	He came too late, the ship was under sail:
         	But there the duke was given to understand
         	That in a gondola were seen together
         	Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
         	Besides, Antonio certified the duke
         	They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
         
         SALANIO	I never heard a passion so confused,
         	So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
         	As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
         	'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
         	Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
         	Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
         	A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
         	Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
         	And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
         	Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
         	She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'
         
         SALARINO	Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
         	Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
         
         SALANIO	Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
         	Or he shall pay for this.
         
         SALARINO	Marry, well remembered.
         	I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday,
         	Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
         	The French and English, there miscarried
         	A vessel of our country richly fraught:
         	I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
         	And wished in silence that it were not his.
         
         SALANIO	You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
         	Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
         
         SALARINO	A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
         	I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
         	Bassanio told him he would make some speed
         	Of his return: he answered, edo not so;
         	Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
         	But stay the very riping of the time;
         	And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
         	Let it not enter in your mind of love:
         	Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
         	To courtship and such fair ostents of love
         	As shall conveniently become you there:'
         	And even there, his eye being big with tears,
         	Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
         	And with affection wondrous sensible
         	He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
         
         SALANIO	I think he only loves the world for him.
         	I pray thee, let us go and find him out
         	And quicken his embraced heaviness
         	With some delight or other.
         
         SALARINO	Do we so.

         SCENE IX	Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
         
         
         	[Enter NERISSA with a Servitor]
         
         NERISSA	Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
         	The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
         	And comes to his election presently.
         
         	[Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON,
         	PORTIA, and their trains]
         
         PORTIA	Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
         	If you choose that wherein I am contained,
         	Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
         	But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
         	You must be gone from hence immediately.
         
         ARRAGON	I am enjoined by oath to observe three things:
         	First, never to unfold to any one
         	Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
         	Of the right casket, never in my life
         	To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
         	If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
         	Immediately to leave you and be gone.
         
         PORTIA	To these injunctions every one doth swear
         	That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
         
         ARRAGON	And so have I addressed me. Fortune now
         	To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
         	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
         	You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
         	What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
         	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
         	What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
         	By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
         	Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
         	Which pries not to the interior, but,  the martlet,
         	Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
         	Even in the force and road of casualty.
         	I will not choose what many men desire,
         	Because I will not jump with common spirits
         	And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
         	Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
         	Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
         	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
         	And well said too; for who shall go about
         	To cozen fortune and be honourable
         	Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
         	To wear an undeserved dignity.
         	O, that estates, degrees and offices
         	Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
         	Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
         	How many then should cover that stand bare!
         	How many be commanded that command!
         	How much low peasantry would then be gleaned
         	From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
         	Picked from the chaff and ruin of the times
         	To be new-varnished! Well, but to my choice:
         	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
         	I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
         	And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
         
         	[He opens the silver casket]
         
         PORTIA	Too long a pause for that which you find there.
         
         ARRAGON	What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
         	Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
         	How much un art thou to Portia!
         	How much un my hopes and my deservings!
         	'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
         	Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
         	Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
         
         PORTIA	To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
         	And of opposed natures.
         
         ARRAGON	What is here?
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	The fire seven times tried this:
         	Seven times tried that judgment is,
         	That did never choose amiss.
         	Some there be that shadows kiss;
         	Such have but a shadow's bliss:
         	There be fools alive, I wis,
         	Silvered over; and so was this.
         	Take what wife you will to bed,
         	I will ever be your head:
         	So be gone: you are sped.
         	Still more fool I shall appear
         	By the time I linger here
         	With one fool's head I came to woo,
         	But I go away with two.
         	Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
         	Patiently to bear my wroth.
         
         	[Exeunt Arragon and train]
         
         PORTIA	Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
         	O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
         	They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
         
         NERISSA	The ancient saying is no heresy,
         	Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
         
         PORTIA	Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
         
         	[Enter a Servant]
         
         Servant	Where is my lady?
         
         PORTIA	                  Here: what would my lord?
         
         Servant	Madam, there is alighted at your gate
         	A young Venetian, one that comes before
         	To signify the approaching of his lord;
         	From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
         	To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
         	Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
         	So ly an ambassador of love:
         	A day in April never came so sweet,
         	To show how costly summer was at hand,
         	As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
         
         PORTIA	No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
         	Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
         	Thou spendest such high-day wit in praising him.
         	Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
         	Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.
         
         NERISSA	Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!

         SCENE I	Venice. A street.
         
         
         	[Enter SALANIO and SALARINO]
         
         SALANIO	Now, what news on the Rialto?
         
         SALARINO	Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath
         	a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;
         	the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very
         	dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many
         	a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
         	Report be an honest woman of her word.
         
         SALANIO	I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
         	knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
         	wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
         	true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
         	plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
         	honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
         	to keep his name company!--
         
         SALARINO	Come, the full stop.
         
         SALANIO	Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
         	lost a ship.
         
         SALARINO	I would it might prove the end of his losses.
         
         SALANIO	Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my
         	prayer, for here he comes in the ness of a Jew.
         
         	[Enter SHYLOCK]
         
         	How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?
         
         SHYLOCK	You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my
         	daughter's flight.
         
         SALARINO	That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
         	that made the wings she flew withal.
         
         SALANIO	And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
         	fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
         	to leave the dam.
         
         SHYLOCK	She is damned for it.
         
         SALANIO	That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
         
         SHYLOCK	My own flesh and blood to rebel!
         
         SALANIO	Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?
         
         SHYLOCK	I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.
         
         SALARINO	There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
         	than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
         	than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
         	tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
         	loss at sea or no?
         
         SHYLOCK	There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
         	prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
         	Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
         	the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
         	call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
         	wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
         	look to his bond.
         
         SALARINO	Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take
         	his flesh: what's that good for?
         
         SHYLOCK	To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,
         	it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
         	hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,
         	mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
         	bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
         	enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
         	not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
         	dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
         	the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
         	to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
         	warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
         	a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
         	if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
         	us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
         	revenge? If we are  you in the rest, we will
         	resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
         	what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
         	wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
         	Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
         	teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
         	will better the instruction.
         
         	[Enter a Servant]
         
         Servant	Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and
         	desires to speak with you both.
         
         SALARINO	We have been up and down to seek him.
         
         	[Enter TUBAL]
         
         SALANIO	Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
         	matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
         
         	[Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant]
         
         SHYLOCK	How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou
         	found my daughter?
         
         TUBAL	I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
         
         SHYLOCK	Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,
         	cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
         	never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
         	till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
         	precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
         	were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!
         	would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in
         	her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know
         	not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon
         	loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to
         	find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
         	nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
         	shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
         	but of my shedding.
         
         TUBAL	Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I
         	heard in Genoa,--
         
         SHYLOCK	What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?
         
         TUBAL	Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.
         
         SHYLOCK	I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?
         
         TUBAL	I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
         
         SHYLOCK	I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!
         	ha, ha! where? in Genoa?
         
         TUBAL	Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one
         	night fourscore ducats.
         
         SHYLOCK	Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
         	gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
         	fourscore ducats!
         
         TUBAL	There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
         	company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.
         
         SHYLOCK	I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture
         	him: I am glad of it.
         
         TUBAL	One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
         	daughter for a monkey.
         
         SHYLOCK	Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
         	turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
         	I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
         
         TUBAL	But Antonio is certainly undone.
         
         SHYLOCK	Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee
         	me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I
         	will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were
         	he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I
         	will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
         	go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.

         	[Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and
         	Attendants]
         
         PORTIA	I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
         	Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
         	I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
         	There's something tells me, but it is not love,
         	I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
         	Hate counsels not in such a quality.
         	But lest you should not understand me well,--
         	And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
         	I would detain you here some month or two
         	Before you venture for me. I could teach you
         	How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
         	So will I never be: so may you miss me;
         	But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
         	That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
         	They have overlooked me and divided me;
         	One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
         	Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
         	And so all yours. O, these naughty times
         	Put bars between the owners and their rights!
         	And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
         	Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
         	I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
         	To eke it and to draw it out in length,
         	To stay you from election.
         
         BASSANIO	Let me choose
         	For as I am, I live upon the rack.
         
         PORTIA	Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
         	What treason there is mingled with your love.
         
         BASSANIO	None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
         	Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
         	There may as well be amity and life
         	'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
         
         PORTIA	Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
         	Where men enforced do speak anything.
         
         BASSANIO	Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
         
         PORTIA	Well then, confess and live.
         
         BASSANIO	'Confess' and 'love'
         	Had been the very sum of my confession:
         	O happy torment, when my torturer
         	Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
         	But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
         
         PORTIA	Away, then! I am locked in one of them:
         	If you do love me, you will find me out.
         	Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
         	Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
         	Then, if he lose, he makes a swan- end,
         	Fading in music: that the comparison
         	May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
         	And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
         	And what is music then? Then music is
         	Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
         	To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
         	As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
         	That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
         	And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
         	With no less presence, but with much more love,
         	Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
         	The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
         	To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
         	The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
         	With bleared visages, come forth to view
         	The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
         	Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
         	I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
         
         	[Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself]
         	
         	SONG.
         	Tell me where is fancy bred,
         	Or in the heart, or in the head?
         	How begot, how nourished?
         	Reply, reply.
         	It is engendered in the eyes,
         	With gazing fed; and fancy dies
         	In the cradle where it lies.
         	Let us all ring fancy's knell
         	I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.
         
         ALL	Ding, dong, bell.
         
         BASSANIO	So may the outward shows be least themselves:
         	The world is still deceived with ornament.
         	In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
         	But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
         	Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
         	What damned error, but some sober brow
         	Will bless it and approve it with a text,
         	Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
         	There is no vice so simple but assumes
         	Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
         	How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
         	As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
         	The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
         	Who, inward searched, have livers white as milk;
         	And these assume but valour's excrement
         	To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
         	And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
         	Which therein works a miracle in nature,
         	Making them lightest that wear most of it:
         	So are those crisped snaky golden locks
         	Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
         	Upon supposed fairness, often known
         	To be the dowry of a second head,
         	The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
         	Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
         	To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
         	Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
         	The seeming truth which cunning times put on
         	To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
         	Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
         	Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
         	'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
         	Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
         	Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
         	And here choose I; joy be the consequence!
         
         PORTIA	[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,
         	As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
         	And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,
         	Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
         	In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
         	I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
         	For fear I surfeit.
         
         BASSANIO	What find I here?
         
         	[Opening the leaden casket]
         
         	Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
         	Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
         	Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
         	Seem they in motion? Here are severed lips,
         	Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
         	Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
         	The painter plays the spider and hath woven
         	A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
         	Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
         	How could he see to do them? having made one,
         	Methinks it should have power to steal both his
         	And leave itself unfurnished. Yet look, how far
         	The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
         	In underprizing it, so far this shadow
         	Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
         	The continent and summary of my fortune.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	You that choose not by the view,
         	Chance as fair and choose as true!
         	Since this fortune falls to you,
         	Be content and seek no new,
         	If you be well pleased with this
         	And hold your fortune for your bliss,
         	Turn you where your lady is
         	And claim her with a loving kiss.
         	A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
         	I come by note, to give and to receive.
         	 one of two contending in a prize,
         	That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
         	Hearing applause and universal shout,
         	Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
         	Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
         	So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
         	As doubtful whether what I see be true,
         	Until confirmed, signed, ratified by you.
         
         PORTIA	You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
         	Such as I am: though for myself alone
         	I would not be ambitious in my wish,
         	To wish myself much better; yet, for you
         	I would be trebled twenty times myself;
         	A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
         	That only to stand high in your account,
         	I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
         	Exceed account; but the full sum of me
         	Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
         	Is an unlessoned girl, unschooled, unpractised;
         	Happy in this, she is not yet so old
         	But she may learn; happier than this,
         	She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
         	Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
         	Commits itself to yours to be directed,
         	As from her lord, her governor, her king.
         	Myself and what is mine to you and yours
         	Is now converted: but now I was the lord
         	Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
         	Queen over myself: and even now, but now,
         	This house, these servants and this same myself
         	Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
         	Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
         	Let it presage the ruin of your love
         	And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
         
         BASSANIO	Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
         	Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
         	And there is such confusion in my powers,
         	As after some oration fairly spoke
         	By a beloved prince, there doth appear
         	Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
         	Where every something, being blent together,
         	Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
         	Expressed and not expressed. But when this ring
         	Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
         	O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!
         
         NERISSA	My lord and lady, it is now our time,
         	That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
         	To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!
         
         GRATIANO	My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
         	I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
         	For I am sure you can wish none from me:
         	And when your honours mean to solemnize
         	The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
         	Even at that time I may be married too.
         
         BASSANIO	With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
         
         GRATIANO	I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
         	My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
         	You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
         	You loved, I loved for intermission.
         	No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
         	Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
         	And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
         	For wooing here until I sweat again,
         	And sweating until my very roof was dry
         	With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
         	I got a promise of this fair one here
         	To have her love, provided that your fortune
         	Achieved her mistress.
         
         PORTIA	Is this true, Nerissa?
         
         NERISSA	Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
         
         BASSANIO	And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
         
         GRATIANO	Yes, faith, my lord.
         
         BASSANIO	Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.
         
         GRATIANO	We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
         
         NERISSA	What, and stake down?
         
         GRATIANO	No; we shall never win at that sport, and stake down.
         	But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
         	and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
         
         	[Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger
         	from Venice]
         
         BASSANIO	Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
         	If that the youth of my new interest here
         	Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
         	I bid my very friends and countrymen,
         	Sweet Portia, welcome.
         
         PORTIA	So do I, my lord:
         	They are entirely welcome.
         
         LORENZO	I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
         	My purpose was not to have seen you here;
         	But meeting with Salerio by the way,
         	He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
         	To come with him along.
         
         SALERIO	I did, my lord;
         	And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
         	Commends him to you.
         
         	[Gives Bassanio a letter]
         
         BASSANIO	Ere I ope his letter,
         	I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
         
         SALERIO	Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
         	Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
         	Will show you his estate.
         
         GRATIANO	Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
         	Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
         	How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
         	I know he will be glad of our success;
         	We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
         
         SALERIO	I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
         
         PORTIA	There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
         	That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
         	Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
         	Could turn so much the constitution
         	Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
         	With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
         	And I must freely have the half of anything
         	That this same paper brings you.
         
         BASSANIO	O sweet Portia,
         	Here are a few of the unpleasantest words
         	That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
         	When I did first impart my love to you,
         	I freely told you, all the wealth I had
         	Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
         	And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
         	Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
         	How much I was a braggart. When I told you
         	My state was nothing, I should then have told you
         	That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
         	I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
         	Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
         	To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
         	The paper as the body of my friend,
         	And every word in it a gaping wound,
         	Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
         	Have all his ventures failed? What, not one hit?
         	From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
         	From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
         	And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
         	Of merchant-marring rocks?
         
         SALERIO	Not one, my lord.
         	Besides, it should appear, that if he had
         	The present money to discharge the Jew,
         	He would not take it. Never did I know
         	A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
         	So keen and greedy to confound a man:
         	He plies the duke at morning and at night,
         	And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
         	If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
         	The duke himself, and the magnificoes
         	Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
         	But none can drive him from the envious plea
         	Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
         
         JESSICA	When I was with him I have heard him swear
         	To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
         	That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
         	Than twenty times the value of the sum
         	That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
         	If law, authority and power deny not,
         	It will go hard with poor Antonio.
         
         PORTIA	Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
         
         BASSANIO	The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
         	The best-conditioned and unwearied spirit
         	In doing courtesies, and one in whom
         	The ancient Roman honour more appears
         	Than any that draws breath in Italy.
         
         PORTIA	What sum owes he the Jew?
         
         BASSANIO	For me three thousand ducats.
         
         PORTIA	What, no more?
         	Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
         	Double six thousand, and then treble that,
         	Before a friend of this description
         	Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
         	First go with me to church and call me wife,
         	And then away to Venice to your friend;
         	For never shall you lie by Portia's side
         	With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
         	To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
         	When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
         	My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
         	Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
         	For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
         	Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
         	Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
         	But let me hear the letter of your friend.
         
         BASSANIO	[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
         	miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
         	very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since
         	in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
         	debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
         	see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
         	pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
         	let not my letter.
         
         PORTIA	O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!
         
         BASSANIO	Since I have your good leave to go away,
         	I will make haste: but, till I come again,
         	No bed shall ever be guilty of my stay,
         	No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

         SHYLOCK	I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
         	I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
         	Thou calledst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
         	But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
         	The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
         	Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
         	To come abroad with him at his request.
         
         ANTONIO	I pray thee, hear me speak.
         
         SHYLOCK	I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
         	I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
         	I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
         	To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
         	To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
         	I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.

         SALARINO	It is the most impenetrable cur

         	I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
         	He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
         	I oft delivered from his forfeitures
         	Many that have at times made moan to me;
         	Therefore he hates me.
         
         SALARINO	I am sure the duke
         	Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
         
         ANTONIO	The duke cannot deny the course of law:
         	For the commodity that strangers have
         	With us in Venice, if it be denied,
         	Will much impeach the justice of his state;

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
         
         
         	[Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and
         	BALTHASAR]
         
         LORENZO	Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
         	You have a noble and a true conceit
         	Of god amity; which appears most strongly
         	In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
         	But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
         	How true a gentleman you send relief,
         	How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
         	I know you would be prouder of the work
         	Than customary bounty can enforce you.
         
         PORTIA	I never did repent for doing good,
         	Nor shall not now: for in companions
         	That do converse and waste the time together,
         	Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
         	There must be needs a  proportion
         	Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
         	Which makes me think that this Antonio,
         	Being the bosom lover of my lord,
         	Must needs be  my lord. If it be so,
         	How little is the cost I have bestowed
         	In purchasing the semblance of my soul
         	From out the state of hellish misery!
         	This comes too near the praising of myself;
         	Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
         	Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
         	The husbandry and manage of my house
         	Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
         	I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
         	To live in prayer and contemplation,
         	Only attended by Nerissa here,
         	Until her husband and my lord's return:
         	There is a monastery two miles off;
         	And there will we abide. I do desire you
         	Not to deny this imposition;
         	The which my love and some necessity
         	Now lays upon you.
         
         LORENZO	                  Madam, with all my heart;
         	I shall obey you in all fair commands.
         
         PORTIA	My people do already know my mind,
         	And will acknowledge you and Jessica
         	In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
         	And so farewell, till we shall meet again.
         
         LORENZO	Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
         
         JESSICA	I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
         
         PORTIA	I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
         	To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
         
         	[Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO]
         
         	Now, Balthasar,
         	As I have ever found thee honest-true,
         	So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
         	And use thou all the endeavour of a man
         	In speed to Padua: see thou render this
         	Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;
         	And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
         	Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
         	Unto the tranect, to the common ferry
         	Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
         	But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.
         
         BALTHASAR	Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         PORTIA	Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
         	That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
         	Before they think of us.
         
         NERISSA	Shall they see us?
         
         PORTIA	They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
         	That they shall think we are accomplished
         	With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
         	When we are both accoutred  young men,
         	I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
         	And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
         	And speak between the change of man and boy
         	With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
         	Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
         	 a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
         	How honourable ladies sought my love,
         	Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
         	I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
         	And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;
         	And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
         	That men shall swear I have discontinued school
         	Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
         	A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
         	Which I will practise.
         
         NERISSA	Why, shall we turn to men?
         
         PORTIA	Fie, what a question's that,
         	If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
         	But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
         	When I am in my coach, which stays for us
         	At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
         	For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE V	The same. A garden.
         
         
         	[Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA]
         
         LAUNCELOT	Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father
         	are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I
         	promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
         	you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
         	therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
         	are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
         	you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
         	hope neither.
         
         JESSICA	And what hope is that, I pray thee?
         
         LAUNCELOT	Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
         	not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
         
         JESSICA	That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
         	sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
         	mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
         	fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
         	gone both ways.
         
         JESSICA	I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
         	Christian.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
         	enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
         	another. This making Christians will raise the
         	price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
         	shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
         
         	[Enter LORENZO]
         
         JESSICA	I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.
         
         LORENZO	I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if
         	you thus get my wife into corners.
         
         JESSICA	Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
         	are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
         	me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
         	says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
         	for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
         	price of pork.
         
         LORENZO	I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
         	you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
         	Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.
         
         LAUNCELOT	It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
         	but if she be less than an honest woman, she is
         	indeed more than I took her for.
         
         LORENZO	How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
         	best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,
         	and discourse grow commendable in none only but
         	parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.
         
         LAUNCELOT	That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
         
         LORENZO	Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid
         	them prepare dinner.
         
         LAUNCELOT	That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.
         
         LORENZO	Will you cover then, sir?
         
         LAUNCELOT	Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
         
         LORENZO	Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
         	the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
         	tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:
         	go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve
         	in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
         
         LAUNCELOT	For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the
         	meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in
         	to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
         	conceits shall govern.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         LORENZO	O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
         	The fool hath planted in his memory
         	An army of good words; and I do know
         	A many fools, that stand in better place,
         	Garnished  him, that for a tricksy word
         	Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?
         	And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
         	How dost thou  the Lord Bassanio's wife?
         
         JESSICA	Past all expressing. It is very meet
         	The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
         	For, having such a blessing in his lady,
         	He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
         	And if on earth he do not mean it, then
         	In reason he should never come to heaven
         	Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
         	And on the wager lay two earthly women,
         	And Portia one, there must be something else
         	Pawned with the other, for the poor rude world
         	Hath not her fellow.
         
         LORENZO	Even such a husband
         	Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
         
         JESSICA	Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
         
         LORENZO	I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.
         
         JESSICA	Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
         
         LORENZO	No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
         '	Then, howsover thou speakest, 'mong other things
         	I shall digest it.
         
         JESSICA	                  Well, I'll set you forth.

         	[Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO,
         	GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others]
         
         DUKE	What, is Antonio here?
         
         ANTONIO	Ready, so please your grace.
         
         DUKE	I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
         	A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
         	uncapable of pity, void and empty
         	From any dram of mercy.
         
         ANTONIO	I have heard
         	Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
         	His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
         	And that no lawful means can carry me
         	Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
         	My patience to his fury, and am armed
         	To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
         	The very tyranny and rage of his.
         
         DUKE	Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
         
         SALERIO	He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
         
         	[Enter SHYLOCK]
         
         DUKE	Make room, and let him stand before our face.
         	Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
         	That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice
         	To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
         	Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
         	Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
         	And where thou now exactest the penalty,
         	Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
         	Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
         	But, touched with human gentleness and love,
         	Forgive a moiety of the principal;
         	Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
         	That have of late so huddled on his back,
         	Enow to press a royal merchant down
         	And pluck commiseration of his state
         	From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
         	From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never trained
         	To offices of tender courtesy.
         	We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
         
         SHYLOCK	I have possessed your grace of what I purpose;
         	And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
         	To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
         	If you deny it, let the danger light
         	Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
         	You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
         	A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
         	Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
         	But, say, it is my humour: is it answered?
         	What if my house be troubled with a rat
         	And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
         	To have it baned? What, are you answered yet?
         	Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
         	Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
         	And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
         	Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
         	Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
         	Of what it s or loathes. Now, for your answer:
         	As there is no firm reason to be rendered,
         	Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
         	Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
         	Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
         	Must yield to such inevitable shame
         	As to offend, himself being offended;
         	So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
         	More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
         	I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
         	A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
         
         BASSANIO	This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
         	To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
         
         SHYLOCK	I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
         
         BASSANIO	Do all men kill the things they do not love?
         
         SHYLOCK	Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
         
         BASSANIO	Every offence is not a hate at first.
         
         SHYLOCK	What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
         
         ANTONIO	I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
         	You may as well go stand upon the beach
         	And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
         	You may as well use question with the wolf
         	Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
         	You may as well forbid the mountain pines
         	To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
         	When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
         	You may as well do anything most hard,
         	As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
         	His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
         	Make no more offers, use no farther means,
         	But with all brief and plain conveniency
         	Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
         
         BASSANIO	For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
         
         SHYLOCK	What judgment shall I dread, doing
         	Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
         	I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
         
         DUKE	How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
         
         SHYLOCK	What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
         	You have among you many a purchased slave,
         	Which,  your asses and your dogs and mules,
         	You use in abject and in slavish parts,
         	Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
         	Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
         	Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
         	Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
         	Be seasoned with such viands? You will answer
         	'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
         	The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
         	Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
         	If you deny me, fie upon your law!
         	There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
         	I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
         
         DUKE	Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
         	Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
         	Whom I have sent for to determine this,
         	Come here to-day.
         
         SALERIO	                  My lord, here stays without
         	A messenger with letters from the doctor,
         	New come from Padua.
         
         DUKE	Bring us the letter; call the messenger.
         
         BASSANIO	Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
         	The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
         	Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
         
         ANTONIO	I am a tainted wether of the flock,
         	Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
         	Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
         	You cannot better be employed, Bassanio,
         	Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
         
         	[Enter NERISSA, dressed  a lawyer's clerk]

         BASSANIO	Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
         
         SHYLOCK	To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
         
         GRATIANO	Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
         	Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
         	No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
         	Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
         
         SHYLOCK	No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
         
         GRATIANO	O, be thou damned, inexecrable dog!
         	And for thy life let justice be accused.
         	Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
         	To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
         	That souls of animals infuse themselves
         	Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
         	Governed a wolf, who, hanged for human slaughter,
         	Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
         	And, whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,
         	Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
         	Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.
         
         SHYLOCK	Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
         	Thou but offendest thy lungs to speak so loud:
         	Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
         	To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
         
         DUKE	This letter from Bellario doth commend
         	A young and learned doctor to our court.
         	Where is he?
         
         NERISSA	                  He attendeth here hard by,
         	To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
         
         DUKE	With all my heart. Some three or four of you
         	Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
         	Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
         
         Clerk	[Reads]
         
         	Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
         	your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
         	your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
         	me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
         	acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
         	the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned over
         	many books together: he is furnished with my
         	opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
         	greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
         	with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
         	request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
         	years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
         	estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
         	old a head. I leave him to your gracious
         	acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
         	commendation.
         
         DUKE	You hear the learned Bellario, what he writes:
         	And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
         
         	[Enter PORTIA, dressed  a doctor of laws]
         
         	Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
         
         PORTIA	I did, my lord.
         
         DUKE	                  You are welcome: take your place.
         	Are you acquainted with the difference
         	That holds this present question in the court?
         
         PORTIA	I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
         	Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
         
         DUKE	Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
         
         PORTIA	Is your name Shylock?
         
         SHYLOCK	Shylock is my name.
         
         PORTIA	Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
         	Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
         	Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
         	You stand within his danger, do you not?
         
         ANTONIO	Ay, so he says.
         
         PORTIA	                  Do you confess the bond?
         
         ANTONIO	I do.
         
         PORTIA	    Then must the Jew be merciful.
         
         SHYLOCK	On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
         
         PORTIA	The quality of mercy is not strained,
         	It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
         	Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
         	It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
         	'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
         	The throned monarch better than his crown;
         	His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
         	The attribute to awe and majesty,
         	Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
         	But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
         	It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
         	It is an attribute to God himself;
         	And earthly power doth then show  God's
         	When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
         	Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
         	That, in the course of justice, none of us
         	Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
         	And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
         	The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
         	To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
         	Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
         	Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
         
         SHYLOCK	My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
         	The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
         
         PORTIA	Is he not able to discharge the money?
         
         BASSANIO	Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
         	Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
         	I will be bound to pay it ten times over,
         	On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
         	If this will not suffice, it must appear
         	That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
         	Wrest once the law to your authority:
         	To do a great right, do a little wrong,
         	And curb this cruel devil of his will.
         
         PORTIA	It must not be; there is no power in Venice
         	Can alter a decree established:
         	'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
         	And many an error by the same example
         	Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
         
         SHYLOCK	A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
         	O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
         
         PORTIA	I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
         
         SHYLOCK	Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
         
         PORTIA	Shylock, there's thrice thy money offered thee.
         
         SHYLOCK	An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
         	Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
         	No, not for Venice.
         
         PORTIA	Why, this bond is forfeit;
         	And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
         	A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
         	Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
         	Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
         
         SHYLOCK	When it is paid according to the tenor.
         	It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
         	You know the law, your exposition
         	Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
         	Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
         	Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
         	There is no power in the tongue of man
         	To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
         
         ANTONIO	Most heartily I do beseech the court
         	To give the judgment.
         
         PORTIA	Why then, thus it is:
         	You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
         
         SHYLOCK	O noble judge! O excellent young man!
         
         PORTIA	For the intent and purpose of the law
         	Hath full relation to the penalty,
         	Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
         
         SHYLOCK	'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
         	How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
         
         PORTIA	Therefore lay bare your bosom.
         
         SHYLOCK	Ay, his breast:
         	So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
         	'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
         
         PORTIA	It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
         	The flesh?
         
         SHYLOCK	         I have them ready.
         
         PORTIA	Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
         	To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
         
         SHYLOCK	Is it so nominated in the bond?
         
         PORTIA	It is not so expressed: but what of that?
         	'Twere good you do so much for charity.
         
         SHYLOCK	I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
         
         PORTIA	You, merchant, have you any thing to say?
         
         ANTONIO	But little: I am armed and well prepared.
         	Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
         	Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
         	For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
         	Than is her custom: it is still her use
         	To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
         	To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
         	An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
         	Of such misery doth she cut me off.
         	Commend me to your honourable wife:
         	Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
         	Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
         	And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
         	Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
         	Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
         	And he repents not that he pays your debt;
         	For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
         	I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
         
         BASSANIO	Antonio, I am married to a wife
         	Which is as dear to me as life itself;
         	But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
         	Are not with me esteemed above thy life:
         	I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
         	Here to this devil, to deliver you.
         
         PORTIA	Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
         	If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
         
         GRATIANO	I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
         	I would she were in heaven, so she could
         	Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
         
         NERISSA	'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
         	The wish would make else an unquiet house.
         
         SHYLOCK	These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
         	Would any of the stock of Barrabas
         	Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
         
         PORTIA	A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
         	The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
         
         SHYLOCK	Most rightful judge!
         
         PORTIA	And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
         	The law allows it, and the court awards it.
         
         SHYLOCK	Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!
         
         PORTIA	Tarry a little; there is something else.
         	This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
         	The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
         	Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
         	But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
         	One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
         	Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
         	Unto the state of Venice.
         
         GRATIANO	O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!
         
         SHYLOCK	Is that the law?
         
         PORTIA	                  Thyself shalt see the act:
         	For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
         	Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
         
         GRATIANO	O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!
         
         SHYLOCK	I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
         	And let the Christian go.
         
         BASSANIO	Here is the money.
         
         PORTIA	Soft!
         	The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
         	He shall have nothing but the penalty.
         
         GRATIANO	O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
         
         PORTIA	Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
         	Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
         	But just a pound of flesh: if thou cutest more
         	Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
         	As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
         	Or the division of the twentieth part
         	Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
         	But in the estimation of a hair,
         	Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
         
         GRATIANO	A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
         	Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
         
         PORTIA	Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
         
         SHYLOCK	Give me my principal, and let me go.
         
         BASSANIO	I have it ready for thee; here it is.
         
         PORTIA	He hath refused it in the open court:
         	He shall have merely justice and his bond.
         
         GRATIANO	A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
         	I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
         
         SHYLOCK	Shall I not have barely my principal?
         
         PORTIA	Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
         	To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
         
         SHYLOCK	Why, then the devil give him good of it!
         	I'll stay no longer question.
         
         PORTIA	Tarry, Jew:
         	The law hath yet another hold on you.
         	It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
         	If it be proved against an alien
         	That by direct or indirect attempts
         	He seek the life of any citizen,
         	The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
         	Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
         	Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
         	And the offender's life lies in the mercy
         	Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
         	In which predicament, I say, thou standest;
         	For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
         	That indirectly and directly too
         	Thou hast contrived against the very life
         	Of the defendant; and thou hast incurred
         	The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
         	Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
         
         GRATIANO	Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
         	And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
         	Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
         	Therefore thou must be hanged at the state's charge.
         
         DUKE	That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
         	I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
         	For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
         	The other half comes to the general state,
         	Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
         
         PORTIA	Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
         
         SHYLOCK	Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
         	You take my house when you do take the prop
         	That doth sustain my house; you take my life
         	When you do take the means whereby I live.
         
         PORTIA	What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
         
         GRATIANO	A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.
         
         ANTONIO	So please my lord the duke and all the court
         	To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
         	I am content; so he will let me have
         	The other half in use, to render it,
         	Upon his death, unto the gentleman
         	That lately stole his daughter:
         	Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
         	He presently become a Christian;
         	The other, that he do record a gift,
         	Here in the court, of all he dies possessed,
         	Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
         
         DUKE	He shall do this, or else I do recant
         	The pardon that I late pronounced here.
         
         PORTIA	Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?
         
         SHYLOCK	I am content.
         
         PORTIA	                  Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
         
         SHYLOCK	I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
         	I am not well: send the deed after me,
         	And I will sign it.
         
         DUKE	Get thee gone, but do it.
         
         GRATIANO	In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
         	Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
         	To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
         
         	[Exit SHYLOCK]
         
         DUKE	Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
         
         PORTIA	I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
         	I must away this night toward Padua,
         	And it is meet I presently set forth.
         
         DUKE	I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
         	Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
         	For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
         
         	[Exeunt Duke and his train]
         
         BASSANIO	Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
         	Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
         	Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
         	Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
         	We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
         
         ANTONIO	And stand indebted, over and above,
         	In love and service to you evermore.
         
         PORTIA	He is well paid that is well satisfied;
         	And I, delivering you, am satisfied
         	And therein do account myself well paid:
         	My mind was never yet more mercenary.
         	I pray you, know me when we meet again:
         	I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
         
         BASSANIO	Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
         	Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
         	Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
         	Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
         
         PORTIA	You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
         
         	[To ANTONIO]
         
         	Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
         
         	[To BASSANIO]
         
         	And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
         	Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
         	And you in love shall not deny me this.
         
         BASSANIO	This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
         	I will not shame myself to give you this.
         
         PORTIA	I will have nothing else but only this;
         	And now methinks I have a mind to it.
         
         BASSANIO	There's more depends on this than on the value.
         	The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
         	And find it out by proclamation:
         	Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
         
         PORTIA	I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
         	You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
         	You teach me how a beggar should be answered.
         
         BASSANIO	Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
         	And when she put it on, she made me vow
         	That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
         
         PORTIA	That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
         	An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
         	And know how well I have deserved the ring,
         	She would not hold out enemy for ever,
         	For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
         
         	[Exeunt Portia and Nerissa]
         
         ANTONIO	My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
         	Let his deservings and my love withal
         	Be valued against your wife's commandment.
         
         BASSANIO	Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
         	Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
         	Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
         
         	[Exit Gratiano]
         
         	Come, you and I will thither presently;
         	And in the morning early will we both
         	Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         PORTIA	Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
         	And let him sign it: we'll away to-night

         GRATIANO	Fair sir, you are well overta'en
         	My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
         	Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
         	Your company at dinner.
         
         PORTIA	That cannot be:
         	His ring I do accept most thankfully:
         	And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
         	I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.
         
         GRATIANO	That will I do.
         
         NERISSA	                  Sir, I would speak with you.
         
         	[Aside to PORTIA]
         
         	I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
         	Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
         
         PORTIA	[Aside to NERISSA]  Thou mayst, I warrant.
         	We shall have old swearing
         	That they did give the rings away to men;
         	But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
         
         	[Aloud]
         
         	Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.

         SCENE I	Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.
         
         
         	[Enter LORENZO and JESSICA]
         
         LORENZO	The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
         	When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
         	And they did make no noise, in such a night
         	Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
         	And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents,
         	Where Cressid lay that night.
         
         JESSICA	In such a night
         	Did Thisbe fearfully overtrip the dew
         	And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
         	And ran dismayed away.
         
         LORENZO	In such a night
         	Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
         	Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
         	To come again to Carthage.
         
         JESSICA	In such a night
         	Medea gathered the enchanted herbs
         	That did renew old AEson.
         
         LORENZO	In such a night
         	Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
         	And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
         	As far as Belmont.
         
         JESSICA	                  In such a night
         	Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
         	Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
         	And never a true one.
         
         LORENZO	In such a night
         	Did pretty Jessica,  a little shrew,
         	Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
         
         JESSICA	I would out-night you, did no body come;
         	But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.
         
         	[Enter STEPHANO]
         
         LORENZO	Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
         
         STEPHANO	A friend.
         
         LORENZO	A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?
         
         STEPHANO	Stephano is my name; and I bring word
         	My mistress will before the break of day
         	Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
         	By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
         	For happy wedlock hours.
         
         LORENZO	Who comes with her?
         
         STEPHANO	None but a holy hermit and her maid.
         	I pray you, is my master yet returned?
         
         LORENZO	He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
         	But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
         	And ceremoniously let us prepare
         	Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
         
         	[Enter LAUNCELOT]
         
         LAUNCELOT	Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
         
         LORENZO	Who calls?
         
         LAUNCELOT	Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
         	Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!
         
         LORENZO	Leave hollaing, man: here.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Sola! where? where?
         
         LORENZO	Here.
         
         LAUNCELOT	Tell him there's a post come from my master, with
         	his horn full of good news: my master will be here
         	ere morning.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         LORENZO	Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
         	And yet no matter: why should we go in?
         	My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
         	Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
         	And bring your music forth into the air.
         
         	[Exit Stephano]
         
         	How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
         	Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
         	Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
         	Become the touches of sweet harmony.
         	Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
         	Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
         	There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdest
         	But in his motion  an angel sings,
         	Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
         	Such harmony is in immortal souls;
         	But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
         	Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
         
         	[Enter Musicians]
         
         	Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
         	With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,
         	And draw her home with music.
         
         	[Music]
         
         JESSICA	I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
         
         LORENZO	The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
         	For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
         	Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
         	Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
         	Which is the hot condition of their blood;
         	If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
         	Or any air of music touch their ears,
         	You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
         	Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze
         	By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
         	Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
         	Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
         	But music for the time doth change his nature.
         	The man that hath no music in himself,
         	Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
         	Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
         	The motions of his spirit are dull as night
         	And his affections dark as Erebus:
         	Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
         
         	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]
         
         PORTIA	That light we see is burning in my hall.
         	How far that little candle throws his beams!
         	So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
         
         NERISSA	When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
         
         PORTIA	So doth the greater glory dim the less:
         	A substitute shines brightly as a king
         	Unto the king be by, and then his state
         	Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
         	Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
         
         NERISSA	It is your music, madam, of the house.
         
         PORTIA	Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
         	Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
         
         NERISSA	Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
         
         PORTIA	The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
         	When neither is attended, and I think
         	The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
         	When every goose is cackling, would be thought
         	No better a musician than the wren.
         	How many things by season seasoned are
         	To their right praise and true perfection!
         	Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
         	And would not be awaked.
         
         	[Music ceases]
         
         LORENZO	That is the voice,
         	Or I am much deceived, of Portia.
         
         PORTIA	He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
         	By the bad voice.
         
         LORENZO	                  Dear lady, welcome home.
         
         PORTIA	We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
         	Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
         	Are they returned?
         
         LORENZO	                  Madam, they are not yet;
         	But there is come a messenger before,
         	To signify their coming.
         
         PORTIA	Go in, Nerissa;
         	Give order to my servants that they take
         	No note at all of our being absent hence;
         	Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
         
         	[A tucket sounds]
         
         LORENZO	Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
         	We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.
         
         PORTIA	This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
         	It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
         	Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
         
         	[Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and
         	their followers]
         
         BASSANIO	We should hold day with the Antipodes,
         	If you would walk in absence of the sun.
         
         PORTIA	Let me give light, but let me not be light;
         	For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
         	And never be Bassanio so for me:
         	But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.
         
         BASSANIO	I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
         	This is the man, this is Antonio,
         	To whom I am so infinitely bound.
         
         PORTIA	You should in all sense be much bound to him.
         	For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.
         
         ANTONIO	No more than I am well acquitted of.
         
         PORTIA	Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
         	It must appear in other ways than words,
         	Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
         
         GRATIANO	[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
         	In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
         	Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
         	Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
         
         PORTIA	A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?
         
         GRATIANO	About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
         	That she did give me, whose posy was
         	For all the world  cutler's poetry
         	Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
         
         NERISSA	What talk you of the posy or the value?
         	You swore to me, when I did give it you,
         	That you would wear it till your hour of death
         	And that it should lie with you in your grave:
         	Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
         	You should have been respective and have kept it.
         	Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
         	The clerk will never wear hair on's face that had it.
         
         GRATIANO	He will, an if he live to be a man.
         
         NERISSA	Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
         
         GRATIANO	Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
         	A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
         	No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
         	A prating boy, that begged it as a fee:
         	I could not for my heart deny it him.
         
         PORTIA	You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
         	To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
         	A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
         	And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
         	I gave my love a ring and made him swear
         	Never to part with it; and here he stands;
         	I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
         	Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
         	That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
         	You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
         	An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
         
         BASSANIO	[Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
         	And swear I lost the ring defending it.
         
         GRATIANO	My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
         	Unto the judge that begged it and indeed
         	Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
         	That took some pains in writing, he begged mine;
         	And neither man nor master would take aught
         	But the two rings.
         
         PORTIA	What ring gave you my lord?
         	Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
         
         BASSANIO	If I could add a lie unto a fault,
         	I would deny it; but you see my finger
         	Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.
         
         PORTIA	Even so void is your false heart of truth.
         	By heaven, I will never come in your bed
         	Until I see the ring.
         
         NERISSA	Nor I in yours
         	Till I again see mine.
         
         BASSANIO	Sweet Portia,
         	If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
         	If you did know for whom I gave the ring
         	And would conceive for what I gave the ring
         	And how unwillingly I left the ring,
         	When nought would be accepted but the ring,
         	You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
         
         PORTIA	If you had known the virtue of the ring,
         	Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
         	Or your own honour to contain the ring,
         	You would not then have parted with the ring.
         	What man is there so much unreasonable,
         	If you had pleased to have defended it
         	With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
         	To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
         	Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
         	I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
         
         BASSANIO	No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
         	No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
         	Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
         	And begged the ring; the which I did deny him
         	And suffered him to go displeased away;
         	Even he that did uphold the very life
         	Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
         	I was enforced to send it after him;
         	I was beset with shame and courtesy;
         	My honour would not let ingratitude
         	So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
         	For, by these blessed candles of the night,
         	Had you been there, I think you would have begged
         	The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
         
         PORTIA	Let not that doctor ever come near my house:
         	Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
         	And that which you did swear to keep for me,
         	I will become as liberal as you;
         	I'll not deny him any thing I have,
         	No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
         	Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
         	Lie not a night from home; watch me  Argus:
         	If you do not, if I be left alone,
         	Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
         	I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
         
         NERISSA	And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
         	How you do leave me to mine own protection.
         
         GRATIANO	Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
         	For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
         
         ANTONIO	I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
         
         PORTIA	Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.
         
         BASSANIO	Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
         	And, in the hearing of these many friends,
         	I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
         	Wherein I see myself--
         
         PORTIA	Mark you but that!
         	In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
         	In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
         	And there's an oath of credit.
         
         BASSANIO	Nay, but hear me:
         	Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
         	I never more will break an oath with thee.
         
         ANTONIO	I once did lend my body for his wealth;
         	Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
         	Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
         	My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
         	Will never more break faith advisedly.
         
         PORTIA	Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
         	And bid him keep it better than the other.
         
         ANTONIO	Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.
         
         BASSANIO	By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
         
         PORTIA	I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
         	For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
         
         NERISSA	And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
         	For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
         	In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
         
         GRATIANO	Why, this is  the mending of highways
         	In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
         	What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
         
         PORTIA	Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
         	Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
         	It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
         	There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
         	Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
         	Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
         	And even but now returned; I have not yet
         	Entered my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
         	And I have better news in store for you
         	Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
         	There you shall find three of your argosies
         	Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
         	You shall not know by what strange accident
         	I chanced on this letter.
         
         ANTONIO	I am dumb.
         
         BASSANIO	Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
         
         GRATIANO	Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
         
         NERISSA	Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
         	Unless he live until he be a man.
         
         BASSANIO	Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
         	When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
         
         ANTONIO	Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
         	For here I read for certain that my ships
         	Are safely come to road.
         
         PORTIA	How now, Lorenzo!
         	My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
         
         NERISSA	Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
         	There do I give to you and Jessica,
         	From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
         	After his death, of all he dies possessed of.
         
         LORENZO	Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
         	Of starved people.
         
         PORTIA	                  It is almost morning,
         	And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
         	Of these events at full. Let us go in;
         	And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
         	And we will answer all things faithfully.
         
         GRATIANO	Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
         	That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
         	Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
         	Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
         	But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
         	That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
         	Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
         	So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Athens. The palace of THESEUS.
         
         
         	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and
         	Attendants]
         
         THESEUS	Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
         	Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
         	Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
         	This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
         	 to a step-dame or a dowager
         	Long withering out a young man revenue.
         
         HIPPOLYTA	Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
         	Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
         	And then the moon,  to a silver bow
         	New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
         	Of our solemnities.
         
         THESEUS	Go, Philostrate,
         	Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
         	Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
         	Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
         	The pale companion is not for our pomp.
         
         	[Exit PHILOSTRATE]
         
         	Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword,
         	And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
         	But I will wed thee in another key,
         	With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
         
         	[Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS]
         
         EGEUS	Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
         
         THESEUS	Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
         
         EGEUS	Full of vexation come I, with complaint
         	Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
         	Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
         	This man hath my consent to marry her.
         	Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
         	This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child;
         	Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
         	And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
         	Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
         	With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
         	And stolen the impression of her fantasy
         	With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
         	Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
         	Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth:
         	With cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart,
         	Turned her obedience, which is due to me,
         	To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
         	Be it so she; will not here before your grace
         	Consent to marry with Demetrius,
         	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
         	As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
         	Which shall be either to this gentleman
         	Or to her death, according to our law
         	Immediately provided in that case.
         
         THESEUS	What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
         	To you your father should be as a god;
         	One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
         	To whom you are but as a form in wax
         	By him imprinted and within his power
         	To leave the figure or disfigure it.
         	Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
         
         HERMIA	So is Lysander.
         
         THESEUS	                  In himself he is;
         	But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
         	The other must be held the worthier.
         
         HERMIA	I would my father looked but with my eyes.
         
         THESEUS	Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
         
         HERMIA	I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
         	I know not by what power I am made bold,
         	Nor how it may concern my modesty,
         	In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
         	But I beseech your grace that I may know
         	The worst that may befall me in this case,
         	If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
         
         THESEUS	Either to die the death or to abjure
         	For ever the society of men.
         	Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
         	Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
         	Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
         	You can endure the livery of a nun,
         	For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,
         	To live a barren sister all your life,
         	Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
         	Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
         	To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
         	But earthlier happy is the rose distilled,
         	Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
         	Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
         
         HERMIA	So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
         	Ere I will my virgin patent up
         	Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
         	My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
         
         THESEUS	Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
         	The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
         	For everlasting bond of fellowship--
         	Upon that day either prepare to die
         	For disobedience to your father's will,
         	Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
         	Or on Diana's altar to protest
         	For aye austerity and single life.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
         	Thy crazed title to my certain right.
         
         LYSANDER	You have her father's love, Demetrius;
         	Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
         
         EGEUS	Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
         	And what is mine my love shall render him.
         	And she is mine, and all my right of her
         	I do estate unto Demetrius.
         
         LYSANDER	I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
         	As well possessed; my love is more than his;
         	My fortunes every way as fairly ranked,
         	If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
         	And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
         	I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
         	Why should not I then prosecute my right?
         	Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
         	Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
         	And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
         	Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
         	Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
         
         THESEUS	I must confess that I have heard so much,
         	And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
         	But, being over-full of self-affairs,
         	My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
         	And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
         	I have some private schooling for you both.
         	For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
         	To fit your fancies to your father's will;
         	Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
         	Which by no means we may extenuate--
         	To death, or to a vow of single life.
         	Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
         	Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
         	I must employ you in some business
         	Against our nuptial and confer with you
         	Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
         
         EGEUS	With duty and desire we follow you.
         
         	[Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA]
         
         LYSANDER	How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
         	How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
         
         HERMIA	Be for want of rain, which I could well
         	Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
         
         LYSANDER	Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
         	Could ever hear by tale or history,
         	The course of true love never did run smooth;
         	But, either it was different in blood,--
         
         HERMIA	O cross! too high to be enthralled to low.
         
         LYSANDER	Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--
         
         HERMIA	O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
         
         LYSANDER	Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
         
         HERMIA	O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
         
         LYSANDER	Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
         	War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
         	Making it momentany as a sound,
         	Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
         	Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
         	That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
         	And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
         	The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
         	So quick bright things come to confusion.
         
         HERMIA	If then true lovers have been ever crossed,
         	It stands as an edict in destiny:
         	Then let us teach our trial patience,
         	Because it is a customary cross,
         	As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
         	Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
         
         LYSANDER	A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
         	I have a widow aunt, a dowager
         	Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
         	From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
         	And she respects me as her only son.
         	There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
         	And to that place the sharp Athenian law
         	Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
         	Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
         	And in the wood, a league without the town,
         	Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
         	To do observance to a morn of May,
         	There will I stay for thee.
         
         HERMIA	My good Lysander!
         	I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
         	By his best arrow with the golden head,
         	By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
         	By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
         	And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen,
         	When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
         	By all the vows that ever men have broke,
         	In number more than ever women spoke,
         	In that same place thou hast appointed me,
         	To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
         
         LYSANDER	Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
         
         	[Enter HELENA]
         
         HERMIA	God speed fair Helena! whither away?
         
         HELENA	Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
         	Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
         	Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
         	More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
         	When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
         	Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
         	Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
         	My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
         	My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
         	Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
         	The rest Ied give to be to you translated.
         	O, teach me how you look, and with what art
         	You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
         
         HERMIA	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
         
         HELENA	O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
         
         HERMIA	I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
         
         HELENA	O that my prayers could such affection move!
         
         HERMIA	The more I hate, the more he follows me.
         
         HELENA	The more I love, the more he hateth me.
         
         HERMIA	His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
         
         HELENA	None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
         
         HERMIA	Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
         	Lysander and myself will fly this place.
         	Before the time I did Lysander see,
         	Seemed Athens as a paradise to me:
         	O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
         	That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!
         
         LYSANDER	Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
         	To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
         	Her silver visage in the watery glass,
         	Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
         	A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
         	Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
         
         HERMIA	And in the wood, where often you and I
         	Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
         	Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
         	There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
         	And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
         	To seek new friends and stranger companies.
         	Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
         	And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
         	Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
         	From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
         
         LYSANDER	I will, my Hermia.
         
         	[Exit HERMIA]
         
         	Helena, adieu:
         	As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         HELENA	How happy some over other some can be!
         	Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
         	But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
         	He will not know what all but he do know:
         	And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
         	So I, admiring of his qualities:
         	Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
         	Love can transpose to form and dignity:
         	Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
         	And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind:
         	Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
         	Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
         	And therefore is Love said to be a child,
         	Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
         	As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
         	So the boy Love is perjured every where:
         	For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne,
         	He hailed down oaths that he was only mine;
         	And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
         	So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
         	I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
         	Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
         	Pursue her; and for this intelligence
         	If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
         	But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
         	To have his sight thither and back again.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         
         
         
         	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	Athens. QUINCE'S house.
         
         
         	[Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and
         	STARVELING]
         
         QUINCE	Is all our company here?
         
         BOTTOM	You were best to call them generally, man by man,
         	according to the scrip.
         
         QUINCE	Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
         	thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
         	interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
         	wedding-day at night.
         
         BOTTOM	First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
         	on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
         	to a point.
         
         QUINCE	Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
         	most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
         
         BOTTOM	A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
         	merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
         	actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
         
         QUINCE	Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
         
         BOTTOM	Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
         
         QUINCE	You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
         
         BOTTOM	What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
         
         QUINCE	A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
         
         BOTTOM	That will ask some tears in the true performing of
         	it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
         	eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
         	measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
         	tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
         	tear a cat in, to make all split.
         	The raging rocks
         	And shivering shocks
         	Shall break the locks
         	Of prison gates;
         	And Phibbus' car
         	Shall shine from far
         	And make and mar
         	The foolish Fates.
         	This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
         	This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
         	more condoling.
         
         QUINCE	Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
         
         FLUTE	Here, Peter Quince.
         
         QUINCE	Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
         
         FLUTE	What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
         
         QUINCE	It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
         
         FLUTE	Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.
         
         QUINCE	That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
         	you may speak as small as you will.
         
         BOTTOM	An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
         	speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
         	Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
         	and lady dear!'
         
         QUINCE	No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.
         
         BOTTOM	Well, proceed.
         
         QUINCE	Robin Starveling, the tailor.
         
         STARVELING	Here, Peter Quince.
         
         QUINCE	Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
         	Tom Snout, the tinker.
         
         SNOUT	Here, Peter Quince.
         
         QUINCE	You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
         	Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
         	hope, here is a play fitted.
         
         SNUG	Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
         	be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
         
         QUINCE	You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
         
         BOTTOM	Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
         	do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
         	that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
         	let him roar again.'
         
         QUINCE	An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
         	the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
         	and that were enough to hang us all.
         
         ALL	That would hang us, every mother's son.
         
         BOTTOM	I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
         	ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
         	discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
         	voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
         	sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
         	nightingale.
         
         QUINCE	You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
         	sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
         	summer's day; a most lovely gentleman- man:
         	therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
         
         BOTTOM	Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
         	to play it in?
         
         QUINCE	Why, what you will.
         
         BOTTOM	I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
         	beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
         	beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
         	perfect yellow.
         
         QUINCE	Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
         	then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
         	are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
         	you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
         	and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
         	town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
         	we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
         	company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
         	will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
         	wants. I pray you, fail me not.
         
         BOTTOM	We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
         	obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.
         
         QUINCE	At the duke's oak we meet.
         
         BOTTOM	Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         
         
         
         	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
         
         
         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE I	A wood near Athens.
         
         
         	[Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK]
         
         PUCK	How now, spirit! whither wander you?
         
         Fairy	     Over hill, over dale,
         	Thorough bush, thorough brier,
         	Over park, over pale,
         	Thorough flood, thorough fire,
         	I do wander everywhere,
         	Swifter than the moon's sphere;
         	And I serve the fairy queen,
         	To dew her orbs upon the green.
         	The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
         	In their gold coats spots you see;
         	Those be rubies, fairy favours,
         	In those freckles live their savours:
         	I must go seek some dewdrops here
         	And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
         	Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
         	Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
         
         PUCK	The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
         	Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
         	For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
         	Because that she as her attendant hath
         	A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
         	She never had so sweet a changeling;
         	And jealous Oberon would have the child
         	Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
         	But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
         	Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
         	And now they never meet in grove or green,
         	By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
         	But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
         	Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
         
         Fairy	Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
         	Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
         	Called Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
         	That frights the maidens of the villagery;
         	Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
         	And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
         	And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
         	Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
         	Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
         	You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
         	Are not you he?
         
         PUCK	                  Thou speakest aright;
         	I am that merry wanderer of the night.
         	I jest to Oberon and make him smile
         	When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
         	Neighing in ness of a filly foal:
         	And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
         	In very ness of a roasted crab,
         	And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
         	And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.
         	The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
         	Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
         	Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
         	And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
         	And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
         	And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
         	A merrier hour was never wasted there.
         	But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.
         
         Fairy	And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
         
         	[Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train;
         	from the other, TITANIA, with hers]
         
         OBERON	Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
         
         TITANIA	What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
         	I have forsworn his bed and company.
         
         OBERON	Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?
         
         TITANIA	Then I must be thy lady: but I know
         	When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
         	And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
         	Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
         	To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
         	Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
         	But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
         	Your buskined mistress and your warrior love,
         	To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
         	To give their bed joy and prosperity.
         
         OBERON	How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
         	Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
         	Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
         	Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
         	From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
         	And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
         	With Ariadne and Antiopa?
         
         TITANIA	These are the forgeries of jealousy:
         	And never, since the middle summer's spring,
         	Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
         	By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
         	Or in the beached margent of the sea,
         	To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
         	But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.
         	Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
         	As in revenge, have sucked up from the sea
         	Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
         	Have every pelting river made so proud
         	That they have overborne their continents:
         	The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,
         	The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
         	Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard;
         	The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
         	And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
         	The nine men's morris is filled up with mud,
         	And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
         	For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
         	The human mortals want their winter here;
         	No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
         	Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
         	Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
         	That rheumatic diseases do abound:
         	And thorough this distemperature we see
         	The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
         	Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
         	And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
         	An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
         	Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
         	The childing autumn, angry winter, change
         	Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
         	By their increase, now knows not which is which:
         	And this same progeny of evils comes
         	From our debate, from our dissension;
         	We are their parents and original.
         
         OBERON	Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
         	Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
         	I do but beg a little changeling boy,
         	To be my henchman.
         
         TITANIA	                  Set your heart at rest:
         	The fairy land buys not the child of me.
         	His mother was a votaress of my order:
         	And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
         	Full often hath she gossiped by my side,
         	And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
         	Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
         	When we have laughed to see the sails conceive
         	And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
         	Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
         	Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
         	Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
         	To fetch me trifles, and return again,
         	As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
         	But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
         	And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
         	And for her sake I will not part with him.
         
         OBERON	How long within this wood intend you stay?
         
         TITANIA	Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
         	If you will patiently dance in our round
         	And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
         	If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
         
         OBERON	Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
         
         TITANIA	Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
         	We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
         
         	[Exit TITANIA with her train]
         
         OBERON	Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
         	Till I torment thee for this injury.
         	My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
         	Since once I sat upon a promontory,
         	And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
         	Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
         	That the rude sea grew civil at her song
         	And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
         	To hear the sea-maid's music.
         
         PUCK	I remember.
         
         OBERON	That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
         	Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
         	Cupid all armed: a certain aim he took
         	At a fair vestal throned by the west,
         	And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
         	As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
         	But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
         	Quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
         	And the imperial votaress passed on,
         	In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
         	Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
         	It fell upon a little western flower,
         	Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
         	And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
         	Fetch me that flower; the herb I shewed thee once:
         	The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
         	Will make or man or woman madly dote
         	Upon the next live creature that it sees.
         	Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
         	Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
         
         PUCK	I'll put a girdle round about the earth
         	In forty minutes.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         OBERON	                  Having once this juice,
         	I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
         	And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
         	The next thing then she waking looks upon,
         	Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
         	On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
         	She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
         	And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
         	As I can take it with another herb,
         	I'll make her render up her page to me.
         	But who comes here? I am invisible;
         	And I will overhear their conference.
         
         	[Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him]
         
         DEMETRIUS	I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
         	Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
         	The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
         	Thou toldest me they were stolen unto this wood;
         	And here am I, and wode within this wood,
         	Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
         	Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
         
         HELENA	You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
         	But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
         	Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
         	And I shall have no power to follow you.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
         	Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
         	Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?
         
         HELENA	And even for that do I love you the more.
         	I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
         	The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
         	Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
         	Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
         	Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
         	What worser place can I beg in your love,--
         	And yet a place of high respect with me,--
         	Than to be used as you use your dog?
         
         DEMETRIUS	Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
         	For I am sick when I do look on thee.
         
         HELENA	And I am sick when I look not on you.
         
         DEMETRIUS	You do impeach your modesty too much,
         	To leave the city and commit yourself
         	Into the hands of one that loves you not;
         	To trust the opportunity of night
         	And the ill counsel of a desert place
         	With the rich worth of your virginity.
         
         HELENA	Your virtue is my privilege: for that
         	It is not night when I do see your face,
         	Therefore I think I am not in the night;
         	Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
         	For you in my respect are all the world:
         	Then how can it be said I am alone,
         	When all the world is here to look on me?
         
         DEMETRIUS	I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
         	And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
         
         HELENA	The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
         	Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
         	Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
         	The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
         	Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
         	When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
         
         DEMETRIUS	I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
         	Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
         	But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
         
         HELENA	Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
         	You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
         	Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
         	We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
         	We should be wood and were not made to woo.
         
         	[Exit DEMETRIUS]
         
         	I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
         	To die upon the hand I love so well.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         OBERON	Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
         	Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
         
         	[Re-enter PUCK]
         
         	Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
         
         PUCK	Ay, there it is.
         
         OBERON	I pray thee, give it me.
         	I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
         	Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
         	Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
         	With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
         	There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
         	Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight;
         	And there the snake throws her enamelled skin,
         	Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
         	And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
         	And make her full of hateful fantasies.
         	Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
         	A sweet Athenian lady is in love
         	With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
         	But do it when the next thing he espies
         	May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
         	By the Athenian garments he hath on.
         	Effect it with some care, that he may prove
         	More fond on her than she upon her love:
         	And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
         
         PUCK	Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.

         TITANIA	Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
         	Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
         	Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
         	Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
         	To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
         	The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
         	At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
         	Then to your offices and let me rest.

         	You spotted snakes with double tongue,
         	Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
         	Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
         	Come not near our fairy queen.
         	Philomel, with melody
         	Sing in our sweet lullaby;
         	Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
         	Never harm,
         	Nor spell nor charm,
         	Come our lovely lady nigh;

         	Weaving spiders, come not here;

         OBERON	What thou seest when thou dost wake,

         	Love and languish for his sake:
         	Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
         	Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
         	In thy eye that shall appear
         	When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
         	Wake when some vile thing is near.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         	[Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA]
         
         LYSANDER	Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
         	And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
         	We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
         	And tarry for the comfort of the day.
         
         HERMIA	Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
         	For I upon this bank will rest my head.
         
         LYSANDER	One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
         	One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
         
         HERMIA	Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
         	Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
         
         LYSANDER	O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
         	Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
         	I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
         	So that but one heart we can make of it;
         	Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
         	So then two bosoms and a single troth.
         	Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
         	For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
         
         HERMIA	Lysander riddles very prettily:
         	Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
         	If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
         	But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
         	Lie further off; in human modesty,
         	Such separation as may well be said
         	Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
         	So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
         	Thy love never alter till thy sweet life end!
         
         LYSANDER	Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
         	And then end life when I end loyalty!
         	Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!

         	Night and silence.--Who is here?
         	Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
         	This is he, my master said,
         	Despised the Athenian maid;
         	And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
         	On the dank and dirty ground.
         	Pretty soul! she durst not lie
         	Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
         	Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
         	All the power this charm doth owe.
         	When thou wakest, let love forbid
         	Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
         	So awake when I am gone;
         	For I must now to Oberon.

         HELENA	O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         HELENA	O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
         	The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
         	Happy is Hermia, wheresoever she lies;
         	For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
         	How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
         	If so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.
         	No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
         	For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
         	Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
         	Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
         	What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
         	Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
         	But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
         	Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
         	Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
         
         LYSANDER	[Awaking]  And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
         	Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
         	That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
         	Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
         	Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
         
         HELENA	Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
         	What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
         	Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
         
         LYSANDER	Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
         	The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
         	Not Hermia but Helena I love:
         	Who will not change a raven for a dove?
         	The will of man is by his reason swayed;
         	And reason says you are the worthier maid.
         	Things growing are not ripe until their season
         	So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
         	And touching now the point of human skill,
         	Reason becomes the marshal to my will
         	And leads me to your eyes, where I overlook
         	Love's stories written in love's richest book.
         
         HELENA	Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
         	When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
         	Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
         	That I did never, no, nor never can,
         	Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
         	But you must flout my insufficiency?
         	Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
         	In such disdainful manner me to woo.
         	But fare you well: perforce I must confess
         	I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
         	O, that a lady, of one man refused.
         	Should of another therefore be abused!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         LYSANDER	She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
         	And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
         	For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
         	The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
         	Or as tie heresies that men do leave
         	Are hated most of those they did deceive,
         	So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,

         	Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
         	Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
         	And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
         	Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
         	What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
         	Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;
         	Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
         	No? then I well perceive you all not nigh

         	will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
         
         BOTTOM	Peter Quince,--
         
         QUINCE	What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
         
         BOTTOM	There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
         	Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
         	draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
         	cannot abide. How answer you that?
         
         SNOUT	By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
         
         STARVELING	I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
         
         BOTTOM	Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
         	Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
         	say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
         	Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
         	better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
         	Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
         	out of fear.
         
         QUINCE	Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
         	written in eight and six.
         
         BOTTOM	No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
         
         SNOUT	Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
         
         STARVELING	I fear it, I promise you.
         
         BOTTOM	Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
         	bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
         	most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
         	wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
         	look to 't.
         
         SNOUT	Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
         
         BOTTOM	Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
         	be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
         	must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
         	defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
         	You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
         	entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
         	for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
         	were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
         	man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
         	his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
         
         QUINCE	Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
         	that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
         	you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.
         
         SNOUT	Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
         
         BOTTOM	A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
         	out moonshine, find out moonshine.
         
         QUINCE	Yes, it doth shine that night.
         
         BOTTOM	Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
         	chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
         	may shine in at the casement.
         
         QUINCE	Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
         	and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
         	present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
         	another thing: we must have a wall in the great
         	chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
         	talk through the chink of a wall.
         
         SNOUT	You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
         
         BOTTOM	Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
         	have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
         	about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
         	fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
         	and Thisby whisper.
         
         QUINCE	If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
         	every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
         	Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
         	speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
         	according to his cue.
         
         	[Enter PUCK behind]
         
         PUCK	What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
         	So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
         	What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
         	An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.
         
         QUINCE	Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
         
         BOTTOM	Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--
         
         QUINCE	Odours, odours.
         
         BOTTOM	--odours savours sweet:
         	So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
         	But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
         	And by and by I will to thee appear.
         
         	[Exit]

         FLUTE	Must I speak now?
         
         QUINCE	Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
         	but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
         
         FLUTE	Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
         	Of colour  the red rose on triumphant brier,
         	Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
         	As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
         	I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
         
         QUINCE	'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
         	yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
         	part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
         	is past; it is, 'never tire.'
         
         FLUTE	O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
         	never tire.
         
         	[Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head]
         
         BOTTOM	If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.

         	masters! fly, masters! Help!

         PUCK	I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,

         	Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
         	A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
         	And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
         	 horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BOTTOM	Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to

         	[Re-enter SNOUT]
         
         SNOUT	O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?

         	you?

         	[Exit]
         
         BOTTOM	I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
         	to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
         	from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
         	and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
         	I am not afraid.
         
         	[Sings]

         	for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish
         	a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry
         	'cuckoo' never so?
         
         TITANIA	I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
         	Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note;
         	So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
         	And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
         	On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.
         
         BOTTOM	Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
         	for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
         	love keep little company together now-a-days; the
         	more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
         	make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.
         
         TITANIA	Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
         
         BOTTOM	Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
         	of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
         
         TITANIA	Out of this wood do not desire to go:
         	Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
         	I am a spirit of no common rate;
         	The summer still doth tend upon my state;
         	And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
         	I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
         	And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
         	And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
         	And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
         	That thou shalt  an airy spirit go.

         	And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
         	To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:

         	[Enter OBERON]
         
         OBERON	I wonder if Titania be awaked;
         	Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
         	Which she must dote on in extremity.
         
         	[Enter PUCK]
         
         	Here comes my messenger.
         		   How now, mad spirit!
         	What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
         
         PUCK	My mistress with a monster is in love.
         	Near to her close and consecrated bower,
         	While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
         	A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
         	That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
         	Were met together to rehearse a play
         	Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
         	The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
         	Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
         	Forsook his scene and entered in a brake
         	When I did him at this advantage take,
         	An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
         	Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
         	And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
         	As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
         	Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
         	Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
         	Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
         	So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
         	And, at our stamp, here over and over one falls;
         	He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
         	Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
         	thus strong,
         	Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
         	For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
         	Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
         	things catch.
         	I led them on in this distracted fear,
         	And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
         	When in that moment, so it came to pass,
         	Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
         
         OBERON	This falls out better than I could devise.
         	But hast thou yet latched the Athenian's eyes
         	With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
         
         PUCK	I took him sleeping,--that is finished too,--
         	And the Athenian woman by his side:
         	That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
         
         	[Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS]
         
         OBERON	Stand close: this is the same Athenian.
         
         PUCK	This is the woman, but not this the man.
         
         DEMETRIUS	O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
         	Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
         
         HERMIA	Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
         	For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
         	If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
         	Being over shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
         	And kill me too.
         	The sun was not so true unto the day
         	As he to me: would he have stolen away
         	From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
         	This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
         	May through the centre creep and so displease
         	Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
         	It cannot be but thou hast murdered him;
         	So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
         
         DEMETRIUS	So should the murdered look, and so should I,
         	Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
         	Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
         	As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
         
         HERMIA	What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
         	Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
         
         DEMETRIUS	I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
         
         HERMIA	Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
         	Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
         	Henceforth be never numbered among men!
         	O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
         	Durst thou have looked upon him being awake,
         	And hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch!
         	Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
         	An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
         	Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
         
         DEMETRIUS	You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
         	I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
         	Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
         
         HERMIA	I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
         
         DEMETRIUS	An if I could, what should I get therefore?
         
         HERMIA	A privilege never to see me more.
         	And from thy hated presence part I so:
         	See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         DEMETRIUS	There is no following her in this fierce vein:
         	Here therefore for a while I will remain.
         	So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
         	For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
         	Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
         	If for his tender here I make some stay.
         
         	[Lies down and sleeps]
         
         OBERON	What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
         	And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
         	Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
         	Some true love turned and not a false turned true.
         
         PUCK	Then fate over-rules, that, one man holding troth,
         	A million fail, confounding oath on oath.

         	And Helena of Athens look thou find:
         	All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
         	With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
         	By some illusion see thou bring her here:
         	I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
         
         PUCK	I go, I go; look how I go,
         	Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         OBERON	   Flower of this purple dye,
         	Hit with Cupid's archery,
         	Sink in apple of his eye.
         	When his love he doth espy,
         	Let her shine as gloriously
         	As the Venus of the sky.
         	When thou wakest, if she be by,
         	Beg of her for remedy.
         
         	[Re-enter PUCK]
         
         PUCK	   Captain of our fairy band,
         	Helena is here at hand;
         	And the youth, mistook by me,
         	Pleading for a lover's fee.
         	Shall we their fond pageant see?
         	Lord, what fools these mortals be!
         
         OBERON	Stand aside: the noise they make
         	Will cause Demetrius to awake.
         
         PUCK	Then will two at once woo one;
         	That must needs be sport alone;
         	And those things do best please me
         	That befal preposterously.
         
         	[Enter LYSANDER and HELENA]
         
         LYSANDER	Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
         	Scorn and derision never come in tears:
         	Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
         	In their nativity all truth appears.
         	How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
         	Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
         
         HELENA	You do advance your cunning more and more.
         	When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
         	These vows are Hermia's: will you give her over?
         	Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
         	Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
         	Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.
         
         LYSANDER	I had no judgment when to her I swore.
         
         HELENA	Nor none, in my mind, now you give her over.
         
         LYSANDER	Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
         
         DEMETRIUS	[Awaking]  O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
         	To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
         	Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
         	Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
         	That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
         	Fanned with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
         	When thou holdest up thy hand: O, let me kiss
         	This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
         
         HELENA	O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
         	To set against me for your merriment:
         	If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
         	You would not do me thus much injury.
         	Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
         	But you must join in souls to mock me too?
         	If you were men, as men you are in show,
         	You would not use a gentle lady so;
         	To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
         	When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
         	You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
         	And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
         	A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
         	To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
         	With your derision! none of noble sort
         	Would so offend a virgin, and extort
         	A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
         
         LYSANDER	You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
         	For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
         	And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
         	In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
         	And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
         	Whom I do love and will do till my death.
         
         HELENA	Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
         	If ever I loved her, all that love is gone.
         	My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned,
         	And now to Helen is it home returned,
         	There to remain.
         
         LYSANDER	                  Helen, it is not so.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
         	Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
         	Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
         
         	[Re-enter HERMIA]
         
         HERMIA	Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
         	The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
         	Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
         	It pays the hearing double recompense.
         	Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
         	Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
         	But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
         
         LYSANDER	Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?
         
         HERMIA	What love could press Lysander from my side?
         
         LYSANDER	Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
         	Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
         	Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
         	Why seekest thou me? could not this make thee know,
         	The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
         
         HERMIA	You speak not as you think: it cannot be.
         
         HELENA	Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
         	Now I perceive they have conjoined all three
         	To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
         	Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
         	Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
         	To bait me with this foul derision?
         	Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
         	The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
         	When we have chid the hasty-footed time
         	For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
         	All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
         	We, Hermia,  two artificial gods,
         	Have with our needles created both one flower,
         	Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
         	Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
         	As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
         	Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
         	 to a double cherry, seeming parted,
         	But yet an union in partition;
         	Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
         	So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
         	Two of the first,  coats in heraldry,
         	Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
         	And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
         	To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
         	It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
         	Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
         	Though I alone do feel the injury.
         
         HERMIA	I am amazed at your passionate words.
         	I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
         
         HELENA	Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
         	To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
         	And made your other love, Demetrius,
         	Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
         	To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
         	Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
         	To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
         	Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
         	And tender me, forsooth, affection,
         	But by your setting on, by your consent?
         	What thought I be not so in grace as you,
         	So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
         	But miserable most, to love unloved?
         	This you should pity rather than despise.
         
         HERNIA	I understand not what you mean by this.
         
         HELENA	Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
         	Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
         	Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
         	This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
         	If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
         	You would not make me such an argument.
         	But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
         	Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
         
         LYSANDER	Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
         	My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!
         
         HELENA	O excellent!
         
         HERMIA	                  Sweet, do not scorn her so.
         
         DEMETRIUS	If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
         
         LYSANDER	Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
         	Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
         	Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
         	I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
         	To prove him false that says I love thee not.
         
         DEMETRIUS	I say I love thee more than he can do.
         
         LYSANDER	If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Quick, come!
         
         HERMIA	Lysander, whereto tends all this?
         
         LYSANDER	Away, you Ethiope!
         
         DEMETRIUS	                  No, no; he'll [        ]
         	Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
         	But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!
         
         LYSANDER	Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
         	Or I will shake thee from me  a serpent!
         
         HERMIA	Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
         	Sweet love,--
         
         LYSANDER	Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
         	Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!
         
         HERMIA	Do you not jest?
         
         HELENA	Yes, sooth; and so do you.
         
         LYSANDER	Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
         
         DEMETRIUS	I would I had your bond, for I perceive
         	A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
         
         LYSANDER	What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
         	Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
         
         HERMIA	What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
         	Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
         	Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
         	I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
         	Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
         	me:
         	Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
         	In earnest, shall I say?
         
         LYSANDER	Ay, by my life;
         	And never did desire to see thee more.
         	Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
         	Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
         	That I do hate thee and love Helena.
         
         HERMIA	O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
         	You thief of love! what, have you come by night
         	And stolen my love's heart from him?
         
         HELENA	Fine, i'faith!
         	Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
         	No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
         	Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
         	Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!
         
         HERMIA	Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
         	Now I perceive that she hath made compare
         	Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
         	And with her personage, her tall personage,
         	Her height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him.
         	And are you grown so high in his esteem;
         	Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
         	How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
         	How low am I? I am not yet so low
         	But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
         
         HELENA	I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
         	Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
         	I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
         	I am a right maid for my cowardice:
         	Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
         	Because she is something lower than myself,
         	That I can match her.
         
         HERMIA	Lower! hark, again.
         
         HELENA	Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
         	I evermore did love you, Hermia,
         	Did ever keep your counsels, never wronged you;
         	Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
         	I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
         	He followed you; for love I followed him;
         	But he hath chid me hence and threatened me
         	To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
         	And now, so you will let me quiet go,
         	To Athens will I bear my folly back
         	And follow you no further: let me go:
         	You see how simple and how fond I am.
         
         HERMIA	Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?
         
         HELENA	A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.
         
         HERMIA	What, with Lysander?
         
         HELENA	With Demetrius.
         
         LYSANDER	Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
         
         DEMETRIUS	No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
         
         HELENA	O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
         	She was a vixen when she went to school;
         	And though she be but little, she is fierce.
         
         HERMIA	'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
         	Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
         	Let me come to her.
         
         LYSANDER	Get you gone, you dwarf;
         	You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;
         	You bead, you acorn.
         
         DEMETRIUS	You are too officious
         	In her behalf that scorns your services.
         	Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
         	Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
         	Never so little show of love to her,
         	Thou shalt aby it.
         
         LYSANDER	                  Now she holds me not;
         	Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
         	Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.
         
         	[Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS]
         
         HERMIA	You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:
         	Nay, go not back.
         
         HELENA	                  I will not trust you, I,
         	Nor longer stay in your curst company.
         	Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
         	My legs are longer though, to run away.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         HERMIA	I am amazed, and know not what to say.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         OBERON	This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,
         	Or else committest thy knaveries wilfully.
         
         PUCK	Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
         	Did not you tell me I should know the man
         	By the Athenian garment be had on?
         	And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
         	That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
         	And so far am I glad it so did sort
         	As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
         
         OBERON	Thou seeest these lovers seek a place to fight:
         	Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
         	The starry welkin cover thou anon
         	With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
         	And lead these testy rivals so astray
         	As one come not within another's way.
         	 to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
         	Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
         	And sometime rail thou  Demetrius;
         	And from each other look thou lead them thus,
         	Till over their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
         	With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
         	Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
         	Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
         	To take from thence all error with his might,
         	And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
         	When they next wake, all this derision
         	Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
         	And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
         	With league whose date till death shall never end.
         	Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
         	I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
         	And then I will her charmed eye release
         	From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
         
         PUCK	My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
         	For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
         	And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
         	At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
         	Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
         	That in crossways and floods have burial,
         	Already to their wormy beds are gone;
         	For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
         	They willfully themselves exile from light
         	And must for aye consort with black-browed night.
         
         OBERON	But we are spirits of another sort:
         	I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
         	And,  a forester, the groves may tread,
         	Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
         	Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
         	Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
         	But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
         	We may effect this business yet ere day.

         PUCK	   Up and down, up and down,
         	I will lead them up and down:
         	I am feared in field and town:
         	Goblin, lead them up and down.
         	Here comes one.
         
         	[Re-enter LYSANDER]
         
         LYSANDER	Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.
         
         PUCK	Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?
         
         LYSANDER	I will be with thee straight.
         
         PUCK	Follow me, then,
         	To plainer ground.
         
         	[Exit LYSANDER, as following the voice]
         
         	[Re-enter DEMETRIUS]
         
         DEMETRIUS	                  Lysander! speak again:
         	Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
         	Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
         
         PUCK	Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
         	Telling the bushes that thou lookest for wars,
         	And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
         	I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
         	That draws a sword on thee.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Yea, art thou there?
         
         PUCK	Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         	[Re-enter LYSANDER]
         
         LYSANDER	He goes before me and still dares me on:
         	When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
         	The villain is much lighter-heeled than I:
         	I followed fast, but faster he did fly;
         	That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
         	And here will rest me.
         
         	[Lies down]
         
         	Come, thou gentle day!
         	For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
         	I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.
         
         	[Sleeps]
         
         	[Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS]
         
         PUCK	Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?
         
         DEMETRIUS	Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot
         	Thou runnest before me, shifting every place,
         	And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
         	Where art thou now?
         
         PUCK	Come hither: I am here.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Nay, then, thou mockest me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
         	If ever I thy face by daylight see:
         	Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
         	To measure out my length on this cold bed.
         	By day's approach look to be visited.

         	Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,
         	That I may back to Athens by daylight,
         	From these that my poor company detest:
         	And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
         	Steal me awhile from mine own company.
         
         	[Lies down and sleeps]
         
         PUCK	Yet but three? Come one more;
         	Two of both kinds make up four.
         	Here she comes, curst and sad:
         	Cupid is a knavish lad,
         	Thus to make poor females mad.
         
         	[Re-enter HERMIA]
         
         HERMIA	Never so weary, never so in woe,
         	Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
         	I can no further crawl, no further go;
         	My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
         	Here will I rest me till the break of day.
         	Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!

         	To your eye,
         	Gentle lover, remedy.
         
         	[Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes]
         
         	When thou wakest,
         	Thou takest
         	True delight
         	In the sight
         	Of thy former lady's eye:
         	And the country proverb known,
         	That every man should take his own,
         	In your waking shall be shown:
         	Jack shall have Jill;
         	Nought shall go ill;

         TITANIA	Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
         	While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
         	And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
         	And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.

         PEASEBLOSSOM	Ready.
         
         BOTTOM	Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?
         
         COBWEB	Ready.
         
         BOTTOM	Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your
         	weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
         	humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
         	mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
         	yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,
         	good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;
         	I would be loath to have you overflown with a
         	honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?
         
         MUSTARDSEED	Ready.
         
         BOTTOM	Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,
         	leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.
         
         MUSTARDSEED	What's your Will?
         
         BOTTOM	Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb
         	to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for
         	methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
         	am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
         	I must scratch.
         
         TITANIA	What, wilt thou hear some music,
         	my sweet love?
         
         BOTTOM	I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
         	the tongs and the bones.
         
         TITANIA	Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
         
         BOTTOM	Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
         	dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
         	of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
         
         TITANIA	I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
         	The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
         
         BOTTOM	I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
         	But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
         	have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
         
         TITANIA	Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
         	Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.
         
         	[Exeunt fairies]
         
         	So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle

         	[Enter PUCK]
         
         OBERON	[Advancing]  Welcome, good Robin.
         	Seeest thou this sweet sight?
         	Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
         	For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
         	Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
         	I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
         	For she his hairy temples then had rounded
         	With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
         	And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
         	Was wont to swell  round and orient pearls,
         	Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
         	 tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
         	When I had at my pleasure taunted her
         	And she in mild terms begged my patience,
         	I then did ask of her her changeling child;
         	Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
         	To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
         	And now I have the boy, I will undo
         	This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
         	And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
         	From off the head of this Athenian swain;
         	That, he awaking when the other do,
         	May all to Athens back again repair
         	And think no more of this night's accidents
         	But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
         	But first I will release the fairy queen.
         	Be as thou wast wont to be;
         	See as thou wast wont to see:
         	Dian's bud over Cupid's flower
         	Hath such force and blessed power.
         	Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
         
         TITANIA	My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
         	Methought I was enamoured of an ass.
         
         OBERON	There lies your love.
         
         TITANIA	How came these things to pass?
         	O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
         
         OBERON	Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
         	Titania, music call; and strike more dead
         	Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
         
         TITANIA	Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
         
         	[Music, still]
         
         PUCK	Now, when thou wakest, with thine
         	own fool's eyes peep.
         
         OBERON	Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
         	And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
         	Now thou and I are new in amity,
         	And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
         	Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
         	And bless it to all fair prosperity:
         	There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
         	Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
         
         PUCK	Fairy king, attend, and mark:
         	I do hear the morning lark.
         
         OBERON	Then, my queen, in silence sad,
         	Trip we after the night's shade:
         	We the globe can compass soon,
         	Swifter than the wandering moon.
         
         TITANIA	Come, my lord, and in our flight
         	Tell me how it came this night
         	That I sleeping here was found
         	With these mortals on the ground.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         THESEUS	Go, one of you, find out the forester;
         	For now our observation is performed;
         	And since we have the vaward of the day,
         	My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
         	Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
         	Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
         
         	[Exit an Attendant]
         
         	We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
         	And mark the musical confusion
         	Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
         
         HIPPOLYTA	I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
         	When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear
         	With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
         	Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
         	The skies, the fountains, every region near
         	Seemed all one mutual cry: I never heard
         	So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
         
         THESEUS	My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
         	So flewed, so sanded, and their heads are hung
         	With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
         	Crook-kneeed, and dew-lapped  Thessalian bulls;
         	Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth  bells,
         	Each under each. A cry more tuneable
         	Was never hollaed to, nor cheered with horn,
         	In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
         	Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?
         
         EGEUS	My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
         	And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
         	This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
         	I wonder of their being here together.
         
         THESEUS	No doubt they rose up early to observe
         	The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
         	Came here in grace our solemnity.
         	But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
         	That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
         
         EGEUS	It is, my lord.
         
         THESEUS	Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
         
         	[Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS,
         	HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up]
         
         	Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
         	Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
         
         LYSANDER	Pardon, my lord.
         
         THESEUS	                  I pray you all, stand up.
         	I know you two are rival enemies:
         	How comes this gentle concord in the world,
         	That hatred is so far from jealousy,
         	To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
         
         LYSANDER	My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
         	Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
         	I cannot truly say how I came here;
         	But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
         	And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
         	I came with Hermia hither: our intent
         	Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
         	Without the peril of the Athenian law.
         
         EGEUS	Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
         	I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
         	They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
         	Thereby to have defeated you and me,
         	You of your wife and me of my consent,
         	Of my consent that she should be your wife.
         
         DEMETRIUS	My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
         	Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
         	And I in fury hither followed them,
         	Fair Helena in fancy following me.
         	But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
         	But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
         	Melted as the snow, seems to me now
         	As the remembrance of an idle gaud
         	Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
         	And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
         	The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
         	Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
         	Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia:
         	But,  in sickness, did I loathe this food;
         	But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
         	Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
         	And will for evermore be true to it.
         
         THESEUS	Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
         	Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
         	Egeus, I will overbear your will;
         	For in the temple by and by with us
         	These couples shall eternally be knit:
         	And, for the morning now is something worn,
         	Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
         	Away with us to Athens; three and three,
         	We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
         	Come, Hippolyta.
         
         	[Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train]
         
         DEMETRIUS	These things seem small and undistinguishable,
         HERMIA	Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
         	When every thing seems double.
         
         HELENA	So methinks:
         	And I have found Demetrius  a jewel,
         	Mine own, and not mine own.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Are you sure
         	That we are awake? It seems to me
         	That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
         	The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
         
         HERMIA	Yea; and my father.
         
         HELENA	And Hippolyta.
         
         LYSANDER	And he did bid us follow to the temple.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him
         	And by the way let us recount our dreams.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         BOTTOM	[Awaking]  When my cue comes, call me, and I will
         	answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!
         	Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
         	the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen
         	hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
         	vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to
         	say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go
         	about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there
         	is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and
         	methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if
         	he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
         	of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not
         	seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue
         	to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
         	was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
         	this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,
         	because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
         	latter end of a play, before the duke:
         	peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall
         	sing it at her death.

         SCENE 	Athens. QUINCE'S house.
         
         
         	[Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING]
         
         QUINCE	Have you sent to Bottom's house? is he come home yet?
         
         STARVELING	He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
         	transported.
         
         FLUTE	If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes
         	not forward, doth it?
         
         QUINCE	It is not possible: you have not a man in all
         	Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
         
         FLUTE	No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
         	man in Athens.
         
         QUINCE	Yea and the best person too; and he is a very
         	paramour for a sweet voice.
         
         FLUTE	You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,
         	a thing of naught.
         
         	[Enter SNUG]
         
         SNUG	Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and
         	there is two or three lords and ladies more married:
         	if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made
         	men.
         
         FLUTE	O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
         	day during his life; he could not have 'scaped
         	sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
         	sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;
         	he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
         	Pyramus, or nothing.
         
         	[Enter BOTTOM]
         
         BOTTOM	Where are these lads? where are these hearts?
         
         QUINCE	Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
         
         BOTTOM	Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
         	what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
         	will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.
         
         QUINCE	Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
         
         BOTTOM	Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that
         	the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
         	good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
         	pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look
         	over his part; for the short and the long is, our
         	play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have
         	clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion
         	pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the
         	lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions
         	nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
         	do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
         	comedy. No more words: away! go, away!

         ACT V
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Athens. The palace of THESEUS.
         
         
         	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and
         	Attendants]
         
         HIPPOLYTA	'Tis strange my Theseus, that these
         	lovers speak of.
         
         THESEUS	More strange than true: I never may believe
         	These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
         	Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
         	Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
         	More than cool reason ever comprehends.
         	The lunatic, the lover and the poet
         	Are of imagination all compact:
         	One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
         	That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
         	Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
         	The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
         	Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
         	And as imagination bodies forth
         	The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
         	Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
         	A local habitation and a name.
         	Such tricks hath strong imagination,
         	That if it would but apprehend some joy,
         	It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
         	Or in the night, imagining some fear,
         	How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
         
         HIPPOLYTA	But all the story of the night told over,
         	And all their minds transfigured so together,
         	More witnesseth than fancy's images
         	And grows to something of great constancy;
         	But, howsoever, strange and admirable.
         
         THESEUS	Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
         
         	[Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA]
         
         	Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
         	Accompany your hearts!
         
         LYSANDER	More than to us
         	Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
         
         THESEUS	Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
         	To wear away this long age of three hours
         	Between our after-supper and bed-time?
         	Where is our usual manager of mirth?
         	What revels are in hand? Is there no play,
         	To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
         	Call Philostrate.
         
         PHILOSTRATE	                  Here, mighty Theseus.
         
         THESEUS	Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
         	What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
         	The lazy time, if not with some delight?
         
         PHILOSTRATE	There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
         	Make choice of which your highness will see first.
         
         	[Giving a paper]
         
         THESEUS	[Reads]  'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
         	By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
         	We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
         	In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
         	Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
         	That is an old device; and it was played
         	When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
         	Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
         	That is some satire, keen and critical,
         	Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
         	And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
         	Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
         	That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
         	How shall we find the concord of this discord?
         
         PHILOSTRATE	A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
         	Which is as brief as I have known a play;
         	But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
         	Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
         	There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
         	And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
         	For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
         	Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
         	Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
         	The passion of loud laughter never shed.
         
         THESEUS	What are they that do play it?
         
         PHILOSTRATE	Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
         	Which never laboured in their minds till now,
         	And now have toiled their unbreathed memories
         	With this same play, against your nuptial.
         
         THESEUS	And we will hear it.
         
         PHILOSTRATE	No, my noble lord;
         	It is not for you: I have heard it over,
         	And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
         	Unless you can find sport in their intents,
         	Extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain,
         	To do you service.
         
         THESEUS	                  I will hear that play;
         	For never anything can be amiss,
         	When simpleness and duty tender it.
         	Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.
         
         	[Exit PHILOSTRATE]
         
         HIPPOLYTA	I love not to see wretchedness over charged
         	And duty in his service perishing.
         
         THESEUS	Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
         
         HIPPOLYTA	He says they can do nothing in this kind.
         
         THESEUS	The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
         	Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
         	And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
         	Takes it in might, not merit.
         	Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
         	To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
         	Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
         	Make periods in the midst of sentences,
         	Throttle their practised accent in their fears
         	And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
         	Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
         	Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome;
         	And in the modesty of fearful duty
         	I read as much as from the rattling tongue
         	Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
         	Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
         	In least speak most, to my capacity.
         
         	[Re-enter PHILOSTRATE]
         
         PHILOSTRATE	So please your grace, the Prologue is addressed.

         	[Flourish of trumpets]
         
         	[Enter QUINCE for the Prologue]
         
         Prologue	If we offend, it is with our good will.
         	That you should think, we come not to offend,
         	But with good will. To show our simple skill,
         	That is the true beginning of our end.
         	Consider then we come but in despite.
         	We do not come as minding to contest you,
         	Our true intent is. All for your delight
         	We are not here. That you should here repent you,
         	The actors are at hand and by their show
         	You shall know all that you are  to know.
         
         THESEUS	This fellow doth not stand upon points.
         
         LYSANDER	He hath rid his prologue  a rough colt; he knows
         	not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
         	enough to speak, but to speak true.
         
         HIPPOLYTA	Indeed he hath played on his prologue  a child
         	on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.
         
         THESEUS	His speech, was  a tangled chain; nothing
         	impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
         
         	[Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion]
         
         Prologue	Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
         	But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
         	This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
         	This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
         	This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
         	Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
         	And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
         	To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
         	This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
         	Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
         	By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
         	To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
         	This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
         	The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
         	Did scare away, or rather did affright;
         	And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
         	Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
         	Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
         	And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
         	Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
         	He bravely broached is boiling bloody breast;
         	And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
         	His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
         	Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
         	At large discourse, while here they do remain.
         
         	[Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine]
         
         THESEUS	I wonder if the lion be to speak.
         
         DEMETRIUS	No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
         
         Wall	In this same interlude it doth befall
         	That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
         	And such a wall, as I would have you think,
         	That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
         	Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
         	Did whisper often very secretly.
         	This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
         	That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
         	And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
         	Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
         
         THESEUS	Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
         
         DEMETRIUS	It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
         	discourse, my lord.
         
         	[Enter Pyramus]
         
         THESEUS	Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!
         
         Pyramus	O grim-looked night! O night with hue so black!
         	O night, which ever art when day is not!
         	O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
         	I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
         	And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
         	That standest between her father's ground and mine!
         	Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
         	Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
         
         	[Wall holds up his fingers]
         
         	Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
         	But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
         	O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
         	Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
         
         THESEUS	The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
         
         Pyramus	No, in truth, sir, he should not. edeceiving me'
         	is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
         	spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
         	fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
         
         	[Enter Thisbe]
         
         Thisbe	O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
         	For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
         	My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones,
         	Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
         
         Pyramus	I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
         	To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!
         
         Thisbe	My love thou art, my love I think.
         
         Pyramus	Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
         	And,  Limander, am I trusty still.
         
         Thisbe	And I  Helen, till the Fates me kill.
         
         Pyramus	Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
         
         Thisbe	As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
         
         Pyramus	O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
         
         Thisbe	I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
         
         Pyramus	Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
         
         Thisbe	'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.
         
         	[Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe]
         
         Wall	Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
         	And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         THESEUS	Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
         
         DEMETRIUS	No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
         	without warning.
         
         HIPPOLYTA	This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
         
         THESEUS	The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
         	are no worse, if imagination amend them.
         
         HIPPOLYTA	It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
         
         THESEUS	If we imagine no worse of them than they of
         	themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
         	come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
         
         	[Enter Lion and Moonshine]
         
         Lion	You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
         	The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
         	May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
         	When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
         	Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
         	A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;
         	For, if I should as lion come in strife
         	Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
         
         THESEUS	A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
         
         DEMETRIUS	The very best at a beast, my lord, that ever I saw.
         
         LYSANDER	This lion is a very fox for his valour.
         
         THESEUS	True; and a goose for his discretion.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
         	discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
         
         THESEUS	His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
         	for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
         	leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
         
         Moonshine	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--
         
         DEMETRIUS	He should have worn the horns on his head.
         
         THESEUS	He is no crescent, and his horns are
         	invisible within the circumference.
         
         Moonshine	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
         	Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
         
         THESEUS	This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
         	should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
         	man i' the moon?
         
         DEMETRIUS	He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
         	see, it is already in snuff.
         
         HIPPOLYTA	I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!
         
         THESEUS	It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
         	he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all
         	reason, we must stay the time.
         
         LYSANDER	Proceed, Moon.
         
         Moonshine	All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
         	lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this
         	thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
         	these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.
         
         	[Enter Thisbe]
         
         Thisbe	This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
         
         Lion	[Roaring]  Oh--
         
         	[Thisbe runs off]
         
         DEMETRIUS	Well roared, Lion.
         
         THESEUS	Well run, Thisbe.
         
         HIPPOLYTA	Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
         	good grace.
         
         	[The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit]
         
         THESEUS	Well moused, Lion.
         
         LYSANDER	And so the lion vanished.
         
         DEMETRIUS	And then came Pyramus.
         
         	[Enter Pyramus]
         
         Pyramus	Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
         	I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
         	For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
         	I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
         	But stay, O spite!
         	But mark, poor knight,
         	What dreadful dole is here!
         	Eyes, do you see?
         	How can it be?
         	O dainty duck! O dear!
         	Thy mantle good,
         	What, stained with blood!
         	Approach, ye Furies fell!
         	O Fates, come, come,
         	Cut thread and thrum;
         	Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
         
         THESEUS	This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
         	go near to make a man look sad.
         
         HIPPOLYTA	Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
         
         Pyramus	O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
         	Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear:
         	Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
         	That lived, that loved, that d, that looked
         	with cheer.
         	Come, tears, confound;
         	Out, sword, and wound
         	The pap of Pyramus;
         	Ay, that left pap,
         	Where heart doth hop:
         
         	[Stabs himself]
         
         	Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
         	Now am I dead,
         	Now am I fled;
         	My soul is in the sky:
         	Tongue, lose thy light;
         	Moon take thy flight:
         
         	[Exit Moonshine]
         
         	Now die, die, die, die, die.
         
         	[Dies]
         
         DEMETRIUS	No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
         
         LYSANDER	Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
         
         THESEUS	With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
         	prove an ass.
         
         HIPPOLYTA	How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
         	back and finds her lover?
         
         THESEUS	She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
         	her passion ends the play.
         
         	[Re-enter Thisbe]
         
         HIPPOLYTA	Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
         	Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
         
         DEMETRIUS	A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
         	Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
         	she for a woman, God bless us.
         
         LYSANDER	She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
         
         DEMETRIUS	And thus she means, videlicet:--
         
         Thisbe	          Asleep, my love?
         	What, dead, my dove?
         	O Pyramus, arise!
         	Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
         	Dead, dead? A tomb
         	Must cover thy sweet eyes.
         	These My lips,
         	This cherry nose,
         	These yellow cowslip cheeks,
         	Are gone, are gone:
         	Lovers, make moan:
         	His eyes were green as leeks.
         	O Sisters Three,
         	Come, come to me,
         	With hands as pale as milk;
         	Lay them in gore,
         	Since you have shore
         	With shears his thread of silk.
         	Tongue, not a word:
         	Come, trusty sword;
         	Come, blade, my breast imbrue:
         
         	[Stabs herself]
         
         	And, farewell, friends;
         	Thus Thisby ends:
         	Adieu, adieu, adieu.
         
         	[Dies]
         
         THESEUS	Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
         
         DEMETRIUS	Ay, and Wall too.
         
         BOTTOM	[Starting up]  No assure you; the wall is down that
         	parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
         	epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
         	of our company?
         
         THESEUS	No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
         	excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
         	dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
         	that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
         	in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine
         	tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
         	discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
         	epilogue alone.
         
         	[A dance]
         
         	The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
         	Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
         	I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
         	As much as we this night have overwatched.
         	This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
         	The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
         	A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
         	In nightly revels and new jollity.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         	[Enter PUCK]
         
         PUCK	     Now the hungry lion roars,
         	And the wolf behowls the moon;
         	Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
         	All with weary task fordone.
         	Now the wasted brands do glow,
         	Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
         	Puts the wretch that lies in woe
         	In remembrance of a shroud.
         	Now it is the time of night
         	That the graves all gaping wide,
         	Every one lets forth his sprite,
         	In the church-way paths to glide:
         	And we fairies, that do run
         	By the triple Hecate's team,
         	From the presence of the sun,
         	Following darkness  a dream,
         	Now are frolic: not a mouse
         	Shall disturb this hallowed house:
         	I am sent with broom before,
         	To sweep the dust behind the door.
         
         	[Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train]
         
         OBERON	     Through the house give gathering light,
         	By the dead and drowsy fire:
         	Every elf and fairy sprite
         	Hop as light as bird from brier;
         	And this ditty, after me,
         	Sing, and dance it trippingly.
         
         TITANIA	First, rehearse your song by rote
         	To each word a warbling note:
         	Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
         	Will we sing, and bless this place.
         
         	[Song and dance]
         
         OBERON	Now, until the break of day,
         	Through this house each fairy stray.
         	To the best bride-bed will we,
         	Which by us shall blessed be;
         	And the issue there create
         	Ever shall be fortunate.
         	So shall all the couples three
         	Ever true in loving be;
         	And the blots of Nature's hand
         	Shall not in their issue stand;
         	Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
         	Nor mark prodigious, such as are
         	Despised in nativity,
         	Shall upon their children be.
         	With this field-dew consecrate,
         	Every fairy take his gait;
         	And each several chamber bless,
         	Through this palace, with sweet peace;
         	And the owner of it blest
         	Ever shall in safety rest.
         	Trip away; make no stay;
         	Meet me all by break of day.
         
         	[Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train]
         
         PUCK	If we shadows have offended,
         	Think but this, and all is mended,
         	That you have but slumbered here
         	While these visions did appear.
         	And this weak and idle theme,
         	No more yielding but a dream,
         	Gentles, do not reprehend:
         	if you pardon, we will mend:
         	And, as I am an honest Puck,
         	If we have unearned luck
         	Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
         	We will make amends ere long;
         	Else the Puck a liar call;
         	So, good night unto you all.
         	Give me your hands, if we be friends,
         	And Robin shall restore amends.

         	[Enter Hostess and SLY]
         
         SLY	I'll pheeze you, in faith.
         
         Hostess	A pair of stocks, you rogue!
         
         SLY	Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
         	the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
         	Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!
         
         Hostess	You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
         
         SLY	No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
         	bed, and warm thee.
         
         Hostess	I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
         	third--borough.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         SLY	Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
         	by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
         	and kindly.
         
         	[Falls asleep]
         
         	[Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train]
         
         Lord	Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
         	Brach Merriman, the poor cur is embossed;
         	And couple Clowder with the deep--mouthed brach.
         	Sawest thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
         	At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
         	I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
         
         First Huntsman	Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
         	He cried upon it at the merest loss
         	And twice to-day picked out the dullest scent:
         	Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
         
         Lord	Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
         	I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
         	But sup them well and look unto them all:
         	To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
         
         First Huntsman	I will, my lord.
         
         Lord	What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?
         
         Second Huntsman	He breathes, my lord. Were he not warmed with ale,
         	This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
         
         Lord	O monstrous beast! how  a swine he lies!
         	Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
         	Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
         	What think you, if he were conveyed to bed,
         	Wrapped in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
         	A most delicious banquet by his bed,
         	And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
         	Would not the beggar then forget himself?
         
         First Huntsman	Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
         
         Second Huntsman	It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
         
         Lord	Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
         	Then take him up and manage well the jest:
         	Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
         	And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
         	Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
         	And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
         	Procure me music ready when he wakes,
         	To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
         	And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
         	And with a low submissive reverence
         	Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
         	Let one attend him with a silver basin
         	Full of rose-water and bestrewed with flowers,
         	Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
         	And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
         	Some one be ready with a costly suit
         	And ask him what apparel he will wear;
         	Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
         	And that his lady mourns at his disease:
         	Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
         	And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
         	For he is nothing but a mighty lord.

         	As he shall think by our true diligence
         	He is no less than what we say he is.
         
         Lord	Take him up gently and to bed with him;
         	And each one to his office when he wakes.

         	That offer service to your lordship.

         Players	We thank your honour.
         
         Lord	Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
         
         A Player	So please your lordship to accept our duty.
         
         Lord	With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
         	Since once he played a farmer's eldest son:
         	'Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well:
         	I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
         	Was aptly fitted and naturally performed.
         
         A Player	I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
         
         Lord	'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
         	Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
         	The rather for I have some sport in hand
         	Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
         	There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
         	But I am doubtful of your modesties;
         	Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
         	For yet his honour never heard a play--
         	You break into some merry passion
         	And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
         	If you should smile he grows impatient.
         
         A Player	Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
         	Were he the veriest antic in the world.
         
         Lord	Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
         	And give them friendly welcome every one:
         	Let them want nothing that my house affords.
         
         	[Exit one with the Players]
         
         	Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
         	And see him dressed in all suits  a lady:
         	That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
         	And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
         	Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
         	He bear himself with honourable action,
         	Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
         	Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
         	Such duty to the drunkard let him do
         	With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
         	And say 'What is't your honour will command,
         	Wherein your lady and your humble wife
         	May show her duty and make known her love?'
         	And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
         	And with declining head into his bosom,
         	Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
         	To see her noble lord restored to health,
         	Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
         	No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
         	And if the boy have not a woman's gift
         	To rain a shower of commanded tears,
         	An onion will do well for such a shift,
         	Which in a napkin being close conveyed
         	Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
         	See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst:
         	Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
         
         	[Exit a Servingman]
         
         	I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
         	Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
         	I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
         	And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
         	When they do homage to this simple peasant.
         	I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
         	May well abate the over-merry spleen
         	Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

         	'lordship:' I never drank sack in my life; and if
         	you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
         	beef: never ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
         	have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
         	than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,
         	sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my

         	pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a

         Lord	Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,

         	Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
         	And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
         	Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
         	Each in his office ready at thy beck.
         	Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
         
         	[Music]

         	Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
         	Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
         	Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
         	Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
         	And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
         
         First Servant	Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
         	As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.

         	Even as the waving sedges play with wind.
         
         Lord	We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
         	And how she was beguiled and surprised,

         	Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
         	Than any woman in this waning age.
         
         First Servant	And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
         	 envious floods over-run her lovely face,
         	She was the fairest creature in the world;

         SLY	Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
         	Or do I dream? or have I dreamed till now?

         	I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
         	Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
         	And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
         	Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
         	And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.

         	O, that once more you knew but what you are!

         	But did I never speak of all that time?
         
         First Servant	O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
         	For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
         	Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
         	And rail upon the hostess of the house;
         	And say you would present her at the leet,
         	Because she brought stone jugs and no sealed quarts:
         	Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
         
         SLY	Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
         
         Third Servant	Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,

         	In peril to incur your former malady,
         	That I should yet absent me from your bed:
         	I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
         
         SLY	Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
         	tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
         	my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
         	despite of the flesh and the blood.

         	My books and instruments shall be my company,
         	On them to took and practise by myself.
         
         LUCENTIO	Hark, Tranio! thou mayest hear Minerva speak.
         
         HORTENSIO	Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
         	Sorry am I that our good will effects
         	Bianca's grief.
         
         GREMIO	                  Why will you mew her up,
         	Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
         	And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
         
         BAPTISTA	Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:
         	Go in, Bianca:
         
         	[Exit BIANCA]
         
         	And for I know she taketh most delight
         	In music, instruments and poetry,
         	Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
         	Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
         	Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
         	Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
         	I will be very kind, and liberal
         	To mine own children in good bringing up:
         	And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
         	For I have more to commune with Bianca.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KATHARINA	Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
         	shall I be appointed hours; as though, be, I
         	knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?
         
         	[Exit]
         
         GREMIO	You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
         	good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not
         	so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
         	together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
         	both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
         	sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
         	man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
         	wish him to her father.
         
         HORTENSIO	So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
         	Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
         	parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
         	that we may yet again have access to our fair
         	mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
         	labour and effect one thing specially.
         
         GREMIO	What's that, I pray?
         
         HORTENSIO	Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
         
         GREMIO	A husband! a devil.
         
         HORTENSIO	I say, a husband.
         
         GREMIO	I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
         	her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool
         	to be married to hell?
         
         HORTENSIO	Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine
         	to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
         	fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,
         	would take her with all faults, and money enough.
         
         GREMIO	I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
         	this condition, to be whipped at the high cross
         	every morning.
         
         HORTENSIO	Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
         	apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
         	friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
         	maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
         	to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
         	and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
         	be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
         	How say you, Signior Gremio?
         
         GREMIO	I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
         	horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
         	thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
         	house of her! Come on.
         
         	[Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO]
         
         TRANIO	I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
         	That love should of a sudden take such hold?
         
         LUCENTIO	O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
         	I never thought it possible or ly;
         	But see, while idly I stood looking on,
         	I found the effect of love in idleness:
         	And now in plainness do confess to thee,
         	That art to me as secret and as dear
         	As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
         	Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
         	If I achieve not this young modest girl.
         	Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
         	Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
         
         TRANIO	Master, it is no time to chide you now;
         	Affection is not rated from the heart:
         	If love have touched you, nought remains but so,
         	'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
         
         LUCENTIO	Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
         	The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
         
         TRANIO	Master, you looked so longly on the maid,
         	Perhaps you marked not what's the pith of all.
         
         LUCENTIO	O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
         	Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
         	That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
         	When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand.
         
         TRANIO	Saw you no more? marked you not how her sister
         	Began to scold and raise up such a storm
         	That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
         
         LUCENTIO	Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
         	And with her breath she did perfume the air:
         	Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
         
         TRANIO	Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
         	I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
         	Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
         	Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
         	That till the father rid his hands of her,
         	Master, your love must live a maid at home;
         	And therefore has he closely mewed her up,
         	Because she will not be annoyed with suitors.
         
         LUCENTIO	Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
         	But art thou not advised, he took some care
         	To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
         
         TRANIO	Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.
         
         LUCENTIO	I have it, Tranio.
         
         TRANIO	                  Master, for my hand,
         	Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
         
         LUCENTIO	Tell me thine first.
         
         TRANIO	You will be schoolmaster
         	And undertake the teaching of the maid:
         	That's your device.
         
         LUCENTIO	It is: may it be done?
         
         TRANIO	Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
         	And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
         	Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
         	Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
         
         LUCENTIO	Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
         	We have not yet been seen in any house,
         	Nor can we lie distinguished by our faces
         	For man or master; then it follows thus;
         	Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
         	Keep house and port and servants as I should:
         	I will some other be, some Florentine,
         	Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
         	'Tis hatched and shall be so: Tranio, at once
         	Uncase thee; take my coloured hat and cloak:
         	When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
         	But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
         
         TRANIO	So had you need.
         	In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
         	And I am tied to be obedient;
         	For so your father charged me at our parting,
         	'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
         	Although I think 'twas in another sense;
         	I am content to be Lucentio,
         	Because so well I love Lucentio.
         
         LUCENTIO	Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
         	And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
         	Whose sudden sight hath thralled my wounded eye.
         	Here comes the rogue.
         
         	[Enter BIONDELLO]
         
         		Sirrah, where have you been?
         
         BIONDELLO	Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
         	Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
         	you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?
         
         LUCENTIO	Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
         	And therefore frame your manners to the time.
         	Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
         	Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
         	And I for my escape have put on his;
         	For in a quarrel since I came ashore
         	I killed a man and fear I was descried:
         	Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
         	While I make way from hence to save my life:
         	You understand me?
         
         BIONDELLO	                  I, sir! never a whit.
         
         LUCENTIO	And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
         	Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
         
         BIONDELLO	The better for him: would I were so too!
         
         TRANIO	So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
         	That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
         	But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
         	You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
         	When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
         	But in all places else your master Lucentio.
         
         LUCENTIO	Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that
         	thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if
         	thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good
         	and weighty.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         	[The presenters above speak]
         
         First Servant	My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
         
         SLY	Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:
         	comes there any more of it?
         
         Page	My lord, 'tis but begun.
         
         SLY	'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:
         	would 'twere done!
         
         	[They sit and mark]

         SCENE 	Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.
         
         
         	[Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO]
         
         PETRUCHIO	Verona, for a while I take my leave,
         	To see my friends in Padua, but of all
         	My best beloved and approved friend,
         	Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
         	Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.
         
         GRUMIO	Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
         	rebused your worship?
         
         PETRUCHIO	Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
         
         GRUMIO	Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
         	I should knock you here, sir?
         
         PETRUCHIO	Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
         	And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
         
         GRUMIO	My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
         	you first,
         	And then I know after who comes by the worst.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Will it not be?
         	Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
         	I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
         
         	[He wrings him by the ears]
         
         GRUMIO	Help, masters, help! my master is mad.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
         
         	[Enter HORTENSIO]
         
         HORTENSIO	How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
         	and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
         
         PETRUCHIO	Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
         	'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.
         
         HORTENSIO	'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
         	mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
         	this quarrel.
         
         GRUMIO	Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
         	if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
         	service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
         	him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
         	use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
         	two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
         	well knocked at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
         
         PETRUCHIO	A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
         	I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
         	And could not get him for my heart to do it.
         
         GRUMIO	Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
         	words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
         	knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
         	now with, 'knocking at the gate'?
         
         PETRUCHIO	Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
         
         HORTENSIO	Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
         	Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
         	Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
         	And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
         	Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
         
         PETRUCHIO	Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
         	To seek their fortunes farther than at home
         	Where small experience grows. But in a few,
         	Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
         	Antonio, my father, is deceased;
         	And I have thrust myself into this maze,
         	Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
         	Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
         	And so am come abroad to see the world.
         
         HORTENSIO	Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
         	And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favoured wife?
         	Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
         	And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
         	And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
         	And I'll not wish thee to her.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
         	Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
         	One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
         	As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
         	Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
         	As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
         	As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
         	She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
         	Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
         	As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
         	I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
         	If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
         
         GRUMIO	Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
         	mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
         	a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with never
         	a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
         	as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
         	so money comes withal.
         
         HORTENSIO	Petruchio, since we are stepped thus far in,
         	I will continue that I broached in jest.
         	I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
         	With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
         	Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
         	Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
         	Is that she is intolerable curst
         	And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
         	That, were my state far worser than it is,
         	I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Hortensio, peace! thou knowest not gold's effect:
         	Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
         	For I will board her, though she chide as loud
         	As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
         
         HORTENSIO	Her father is Baptista Minola,
         	An affable and courteous gentleman:
         	Her name is Katharina Minola,
         	Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue.
         
         PETRUCHIO	I know her father, though I know not her;
         	And he knew my deceased father well.
         	I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
         	And therefore let me be thus bold with you
         	To give you over at this first encounter,
         	Unless you will accompany me thither.
         
         GRUMIO	I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
         	O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
         	would think scolding would do little good upon him:
         	she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
         	why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in
         	his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
         	stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
         	her face and so disfigure her with it that she
         	shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
         	You know him not, sir.
         
         HORTENSIO	Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
         	For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
         	He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
         	His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
         	And her withholds from me and other more,
         	Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
         	Supposing it a thing impossible,
         	For those defects I have before rehearsed,
         	That ever Katharina will be wooed;
         	Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
         	That none shall have access unto Bianca
         	Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.
         
         GRUMIO	Katharina the curst!
         	A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
         
         HORTENSIO	Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
         	And offer me disguised in sober robes
         	To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
         	Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
         	That so I may, by this device, at least
         	Have leave and leisure to make love to her
         	And unsuspected court her by herself.
         
         GRUMIO	Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
         	how the young folks lay their heads together!
         
         	[Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised]
         
         	Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?
         
         HORTENSIO	Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
         	Petruchio, stand by a while.
         
         GRUMIO	A proper stripling and an amorous!
         
         GREMIO	O, very well; I have perused the note.
         	Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:
         	All books of love, see that at any hand;
         	And see you read no other lectures to her:
         	You understand me: over and beside
         	Signior Baptista's liberality,
         	I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
         	And let me have them very well perfumed
         	For she is sweeter than perfume itself
         	To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
         
         LUCENTIO	Whatever I read to her, I'll plead for you
         	As for my patron, stand you so assured,
         	As firmly as yourself were still in place:
         	Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
         	Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
         
         GREMIO	O this learning, what a thing it is!
         
         GRUMIO	O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
         
         PETRUCHIO	Peace, sirrah!
         
         HORTENSIO	Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.
         
         GREMIO	And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
         	Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
         	I promised to inquire carefully
         	About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
         	And by good fortune I have lighted well
         	On this young man, for learning and behavior
         	Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
         	And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.
         
         HORTENSIO	'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
         	Hath promised me to help me to another,
         	A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
         	So shall I no whit be behind in duty
         	To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
         
         GREMIO	Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.
         
         GRUMIO	And that his bags shall prove.
         
         HORTENSIO	Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
         	Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
         	I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
         	Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
         	Upon agreement from us to his liking,
         	Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,
         	Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
         
         GREMIO	So said, so done, is well.
         	Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
         
         PETRUCHIO	I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
         	If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
         
         GREMIO	No, sayest me so, friend? What countryman?
         
         PETRUCHIO	Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
         	My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
         	And I do hope good days and long to see.
         
         GREMIO	O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
         	But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
         	You shall have me assisting you in all.
         	But will you woo this wild-cat?
         
         PETRUCHIO	Will I live?
         
         GRUMIO	Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Why came I hither but to that intent?
         	Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
         	Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
         	Have I not heard the sea puffed up with winds
         	Rage  an angry boar chafed with sweat?
         	Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
         	And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
         	Have I not in a pitched battle heard
         	Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
         	And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
         	That gives not half so great a blow to hear
         	As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
         	Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.
         
         GRUMIO	For he fears none.
         
         GREMIO	Hortensio, hark:
         	This gentleman is happily arrived,
         	My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
         
         HORTENSIO	I promised we would be contributors
         	And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoever.
         
         GREMIO	And so we will, provided that he win her.
         
         GRUMIO	I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
         
         	[Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO]
         
         TRANIO	Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
         	Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
         	To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
         
         BIONDELLO	He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?
         
         TRANIO	Even he, Biondello.
         
         GREMIO	Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--
         
         TRANIO	Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?
         
         PETRUCHIO	Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
         
         TRANIO	I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
         
         LUCENTIO	Well begun, Tranio.
         
         HORTENSIO	Sir, a word ere you go;
         	Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
         
         TRANIO	And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
         
         GREMIO	No; if without more words you will get you hence.
         
         TRANIO	Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
         	For me as for you?
         
         GREMIO	                  But so is not she.
         
         TRANIO	For what reason, I beseech you?
         
         GREMIO	For this reason, if you'll know,
         	That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
         
         HORTENSIO	That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
         
         TRANIO	Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
         	Do me this right; hear me with patience.
         	Baptista is a noble gentleman,
         	To whom my father is not all unknown;
         	And were his daughter fairer than she is,
         	She may more suitors have and me for one.
         	Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
         	Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
         	And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
         	Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
         
         GREMIO	What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.
         
         LUCENTIO	Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
         
         HORTENSIO	Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
         	Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
         
         TRANIO	No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
         	The one as famous for a scolding tongue
         	As is the other for beauteous modesty.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
         
         GREMIO	Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
         	And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
         	The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
         	Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
         	And will not promise her to any man
         	Until the elder sister first be wed:
         	The younger then is free and not before.
         
         TRANIO	If it be so, sir, that you are the man
         	Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
         	And if you break the ice and do this feat,
         	Achieve the elder, set the younger free
         	For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
         	Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
         
         HORTENSIO	Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
         	And since you do profess to be a suitor,
         	You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
         	To whom we all rest generally beholding.
         
         TRANIO	Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
         	Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
         	And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
         	And do as adversaries do in law,
         	Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

         	|  O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

         SCENE I	Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.
         
         
         	[Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA]
         
         BIANCA	Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
         	To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
         	That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
         	Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
         	Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
         	Or what you will command me will I do,
         	So well I know my duty to my elders.
         
         KATHARINA	Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
         	Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
         
         BIANCA	Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
         	I never yet beheld that special face
         	Which I could fancy more than any other.
         
         KATHARINA	Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
         
         BIANCA	If you affect him, sister, here I swear
         	I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
         	him.
         
         KATHARINA	O then, be, you fancy riches more:
         	You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
         
         BIANCA	Is it for him you do envy me so?
         	Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
         	You have but jested with me all this while:
         	I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
         
         KATHARINA	If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
         
         	[Strikes her]
         
         	[Enter BAPTISTA]
         
         BAPTISTA	Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
         	Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
         	Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
         	For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
         	Why dost thou wrong her that did never wrong thee?
         	When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
         
         KATHARINA	Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
         
         	[Flies after BIANCA]
         
         BAPTISTA	What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
         
         	[Exit BIANCA]
         
         KATHARINA	What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
         	She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
         	I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
         	And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
         	Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
         	Till I can find occasion of revenge.

         BAPTISTA	I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.
         
         GREMIO	You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
         
         PETRUCHIO	You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
         	I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
         	That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
         	Her affability and bashful modesty,
         	Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
         	Am bold to show myself a forward guest
         	Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
         	Of that report which I so oft have heard.
         	And, for an entrance to my entertainment,

         	Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
         	His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
         
         BAPTISTA	You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
         	But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
         	She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
         
         PETRUCHIO	I see you do not mean to part with her,
         	Or else you  not of my company.
         
         BAPTISTA	Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
         	Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?

         GREMIO	Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
         	Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
         	Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
         
         PETRUCHIO	O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
         
         GREMIO	I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
         	wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
         	sure of it. To express the  kindness, myself,
         	that have been more kindly beholding to you than
         	any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
         
         	[Presenting LUCENTIO]

         	in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
         	in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
         	accept his service.
         
         BAPTISTA	A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.

         	[To TRANIO]
         
         	But, gentle sir, methinks you walk  a stranger:
         	may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
         
         TRANIO	Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
         	That, being a stranger in this city here,
         	Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
         	Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
         	Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
         	In the preferment of the eldest sister.
         	This liberty is all that I request,
         	That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
         	I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
         	And free access and favour as the rest:
         	And, toward the education of your daughters,
         	I here bestow a simple instrument,
         	And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
         	If you accept them, then their worth is great.
         
         BAPTISTA	Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?
         
         TRANIO	Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.

         	And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
         	And every day I cannot come to woo.
         	You knew my father well, and in him me,
         	Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
         	Which I have bettered rather than decreased:
         	Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
         	What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
         
         BAPTISTA	After my death the one half of my lands,
         	And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
         
         PETRUCHIO	And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
         	Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
         	In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
         	Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
         	That covenants may be kept on either hand.
         
         BAPTISTA	Ay, when the special thing is well obtained,
         	That is, her love; for that is all in all.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
         	I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
         	And where two raging fires meet together
         	They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
         	Though little fire grows great with little wind,
         	Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
         	So I to her and so she yields to me;
         	For I am rough and woo not  a babe.
         
         BAPTISTA	Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
         	But be thou armed for some unhappy words.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
         	That shake not, though they blow perpetually.
         
         	[Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke]
         
         BAPTISTA	How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
         
         HORTENSIO	For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
         
         BAPTISTA	What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
         
         HORTENSIO	I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
         	Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
         
         BAPTISTA	Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
         
         HORTENSIO	Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
         	I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
         	And bowed her hand to teach her fingering;
         	When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
         	'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
         	with them:'
         	And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
         	And through the instrument my pate made way;
         	And there I stood amazed for a while,
         	As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
         	While she did call me rascal fiddler
         	And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
         	As had she studied to misuse me so.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
         	I love her ten times more than ever I did:
         	O, how I long to have some chat with her!
         
         BAPTISTA	Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
         	Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
         	She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
         	Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
         	Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
         
         PETRUCHIO	I pray you do.
         
         	[Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO]
         
         	I will attend her here,
         	And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
         	Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
         	She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
         	Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
         	As morning roses newly washed with dew:
         	Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
         	Then I'll commend her volubility,
         	And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
         	If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
         	As though she bid me stay by her a week:
         	If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
         	When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
         	But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
         
         	[Enter KATHARINA]
         
         	Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.
         
         KATHARINA	Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
         	They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
         
         PETRUCHIO	You lie, in faith; for you are called plain Kate,
         	And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
         	But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
         	Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
         	For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
         	Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
         	Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
         	Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
         	Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
         	Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
         
         KATHARINA	Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
         	Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
         	You were a moveable.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Why, what's a moveable?
         
         KATHARINA	A joined-stool.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.
         
         KATHARINA	Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Women are made to bear, and so are you.
         
         KATHARINA	No such jade as you, if me you mean.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
         	For, knowing thee to be but young and light--
         
         KATHARINA	Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
         	And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Should be! should--buzz!
         
         KATHARINA	Well ta'en, and  a buzzard.
         
         PETRUCHIO	O slow-winged turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
         
         KATHARINA	Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
         
         KATHARINA	If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
         
         PETRUCHIO	My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
         
         KATHARINA	Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
         
         PETRUCHIO	Who knows not where a wasp does
         	wear his sting? In his tail.
         
         KATHARINA	In his tongue.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Whose tongue?
         
         KATHARINA	Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
         
         PETRUCHIO	What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
         	Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
         
         KATHARINA	That I'll try.
         
         	[She strikes him]
         
         PETRUCHIO	I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
         
         KATHARINA	So may you lose your arms:
         	If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
         	And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
         
         PETRUCHIO	A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
         
         KATHARINA	What is your crest? a coxcomb?
         
         PETRUCHIO	A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
         
         KATHARINA	No cock of mine; you crow too  a craven.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
         
         KATHARINA	It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
         
         KATHARINA	There is, there is.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Then show it me.
         
         KATHARINA	Had I a glass, I would.
         
         PETRUCHIO	What, you mean my face?
         
         KATHARINA	Well aimed of such a young one.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
         
         KATHARINA	Yet you are withered.
         
         PETRUCHIO	'Tis with cares.
         
         KATHARINA	I care not.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.
         
         KATHARINA	I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
         
         PETRUCHIO	No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
         	'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
         	And now I find report a very liar;
         	For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
         	But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
         	Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
         	Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
         	Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
         	But thou with mildness entertainest thy wooers,
         	With gentle conference, soft and affable.
         	Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
         	O slanderous world! Kate  the hazel-twig
         	Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
         	As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
         	O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.
         
         KATHARINA	Go, fool, and whom thou keepest command.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Did ever Dian so become a grove
         	As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
         	O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
         	And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
         
         KATHARINA	Where did you study all this goodly speech?
         
         PETRUCHIO	It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
         
         KATHARINA	A witty mother! witless else her son.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Am I not wise?
         
         KATHARINA	Yes; keep you warm.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
         	And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
         	Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
         	That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
         	And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
         	Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
         	For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
         	Thy beauty, that doth make me  thee well,
         	Thou must be married to no man but me;
         	For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
         	And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
         	Conformable as other household Kates.
         	Here comes your father: never make denial;
         	I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
         
         	[Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO]
         
         BAPTISTA	Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
         
         PETRUCHIO	How but well, sir? how but well?
         	It were impossible I should speed amiss.
         
         BAPTISTA	Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?
         
         KATHARINA	Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
         	You have showed a tender fatherly regard,
         	To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
         	A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
         	That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
         	That talked of her, have talked amiss of her:
         	If she be curst, it is for policy,
         	For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
         	She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
         	For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
         	And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
         	And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
         	That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
         
         KATHARINA	I'll see thee hanged on Sunday first.
         
         GREMIO	Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
         	hanged first.
         
         TRANIO	Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
         
         PETRUCHIO	Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
         	If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
         	'Tis bargained 'twixt us twain, being alone,
         	That she shall still be curst in company.
         	I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
         	How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
         	She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
         	She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
         	That in a twink she won me to her love.
         	O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
         	How tame, when men and women are alone,
         	A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
         	Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
         	To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
         	Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
         	I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.
         
         BAPTISTA	I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
         	God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.
         
         
         GREMIO	|
         	|  Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
         TRANIO	|
         
         
         PETRUCHIO	Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
         	I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
         	We will have rings and things and fine array;
         	And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.
         
         	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally]
         
         GREMIO	Was ever match clapped up so suddenly?
         
         BAPTISTA	Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
         	And venture madly on a desperate mart.
         
         TRANIO	'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
         	'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
         
         BAPTISTA	The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
         
         GREMIO	No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
         	But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
         	Now is the day we long have looked for:
         	I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
         
         TRANIO	And I am one that love Bianca more
         	Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.
         
         GREMIO	Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
         
         TRANIO	Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
         
         GREMIO	But thine doth fry.
         	Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.
         
         TRANIO	But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
         
         BAPTISTA	Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
         	'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
         	That can assure my daughter greatest dower
         	Shall have my Bianca's love.
         	Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?
         
         GREMIO	First, as you know, my house within the city
         	Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
         	Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
         	My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
         	In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns;
         	In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
         	Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
         	Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl,
         	Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
         	Pewter and brass and all things that belong
         	To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
         	I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
         	Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
         	And all things answerable to this portion.
         	Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
         	And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
         	If whilst I live she will be only mine.
         
         TRANIO	That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
         	I am my father's heir and only son:
         	If I may have your daughter to my wife,
         	I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
         	Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
         	Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
         	Besides two thousand ducats by the year
         	Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
         	What, have I pinched you, Signior Gremio?
         
         GREMIO	Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
         	My land amounts not to so much in all:
         	That she shall have; besides an argosy
         	That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
         	What, have I choked you with an argosy?
         
         TRANIO	Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
         	Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
         	And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
         	And twice as much, whatever thou offerest next.
         
         GREMIO	Nay, I have offered all, I have no more;
         	And she can have no more than all I have:
         	If you  me, she shall have me and mine.
         
         TRANIO	Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
         	By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.
         
         BAPTISTA	I must confess your offer is the best;
         	And, let your father make her the assurance,
         	She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
         	if you should die before him, where's her dower?
         
         TRANIO	That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
         
         GREMIO	And may not young men die, as well as old?
         
         BAPTISTA	Well, gentlemen,
         	I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
         	My daughter Katharina is to be married:
         	Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
         	Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
         	If not, Signior Gremio:
         	And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
         
         GREMIO	Adieu, good neighbour.
         
         	[Exit BAPTISTA]
         
         		Now I fear thee not:
         	Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
         	To give thee all, and in his waning age
         	Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
         	An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         TRANIO	A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
         	Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
         	'Tis in my head to do my master good:
         	I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
         	Must get a father, called 'supposed Vincentio;'
         	And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
         	Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
         	A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

         	[Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA]
         
         LUCENTIO	Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
         	Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
         	Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
         
         HORTENSIO	But, wrangling pedant, this is
         	The patroness of heavenly harmony:
         	Then give me leave to have prerogative;
         	And when in music we have spent an hour,
         	Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
         
         LUCENTIO	Preposterous ass, that never read so far
         	To know the cause why music was ordained!
         	Was it not to refresh the mind of man
         	After his studies or his usual pain?
         	Then give me leave to read philosophy,
         	And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
         
         HORTENSIO	Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
         
         BIANCA	Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
         	To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
         	I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
         	I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
         	But learn my lessons as I please myself.
         	And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
         	Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
         	His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
         
         HORTENSIO	You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
         
         LUCENTIO	That will be never: tune your instrument.
         
         BIANCA	Where left we last?
         
         LUCENTIO	Here, madam:
         	'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
         	Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
         
         BIANCA	Construe them.
         
         LUCENTIO	'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
         	Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
         	'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
         	'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
         	a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
         	bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
         	beguile the old pantaloon.
         
         HORTENSIO	Madam, my instrument's in tune.
         
         BIANCA	Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
         
         LUCENTIO	Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
         
         BIANCA	Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
         	Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
         	trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
         	he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
         	despair not.
         
         HORTENSIO	Madam, 'tis now in tune.
         
         LUCENTIO	All but the base.
         
         HORTENSIO	The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	How fiery and forward our pedant is!
         	Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
         	Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
         
         BIANCA	In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
         
         LUCENTIO	Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
         	Was Ajax, called so from his grandfather.
         
         BIANCA	I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
         	I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
         	But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
         	Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
         	That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
         
         HORTENSIO	You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
         	My lessons make no music in three parts.
         
         LUCENTIO	Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
         	Our fine musician groweth amorous.
         
         HORTENSIO	Madam, before you touch the instrument,
         	To learn the order of my fingering,
         	I must begin with rudiments of art;
         	To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
         	More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
         	Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
         	And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.
         
         BIANCA	Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
         
         HORTENSIO	Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
         
         BIANCA	[Reads]  ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,
         	'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion;
         	'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,
         	'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:
         	ed sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:
         	'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'
         	Call you this gamut? tut, I  it not:
         	Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,
         	To change true rules for old inventions.
         
         	[Enter a Servant]
         
         Servant	Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
         	And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
         	You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
         
         BIANCA	Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.
         
         	[Exeunt BIANCA and Servant]
         
         LUCENTIO	Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         HORTENSIO	But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
         	Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
         	Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
         	To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
         	Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
         	Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.

         SCENE 	Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
         
         
         	[Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA,
         	LUCENTIO, and others, attendants]
         
         BAPTISTA	[To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the
         	'pointed day.
         	That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,
         	And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
         	What will be said? what mockery will it be,
         	To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
         	To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
         	What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
         
         KATHARINA	No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
         	To give my hand opposed against my heart
         	Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
         	Who wooed in haste and means to wed at leisure.
         	I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
         	Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
         	And, to be noted for a merry man,
         	He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
         	Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
         	Yet never means to wed where he hath wooed.
         	Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
         	And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
         	If it would please him come and marry her!'
         
         TRANIO	Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
         	Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
         	Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
         	Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
         	Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
         
         KATHARINA	Would Katharina had never seen him though!
         
         	[Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others]
         
         BAPTISTA	Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
         	For such an injury would vex a very saint,
         	Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
         
         	[Enter BIONDELLO]
         
         BIONDELLO	Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
         	you never heard of!
         
         BAPTISTA	Is it new and old too? how may that be?
         
         BIONDELLO	Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?
         
         BAPTISTA	Is he come?
         
         BIONDELLO	Why, no, sir.
         
         BAPTISTA	What then?
         
         BIONDELLO	He is coming.
         
         BAPTISTA	When will he be here?
         
         BIONDELLO	When he stands where I am and sees you there.
         
         TRANIO	But say, what to thine old news?
         
         BIONDELLO	Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
         	jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
         	of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
         	another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
         	town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
         	with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
         	old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
         	besides, possessed with the glanders and  to mose
         	in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
         	with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
         	spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
         	stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
         	bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
         	near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
         	and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
         	restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
         	often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
         	six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
         	which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
         	in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.
         
         BAPTISTA	Who comes with him?
         
         BIONDELLO	O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
         	 the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
         	kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
         	and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
         	fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
         	very monster in apparel, and not  a Christian
         	footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
         
         TRANIO	'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
         	Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparelled.
         
         BAPTISTA	I am glad he's come, howsoever he comes.
         
         BIONDELLO	Why, sir, he comes not.
         
         BAPTISTA	Didst thou not say he comes?
         
         BIONDELLO	Who? that Petruchio came?
         
         BAPTISTA	Ay, that Petruchio came.
         
         BIONDELLO	No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
         
         BAPTISTA	Why, that's all one.
         
         BIONDELLO	   Nay, by Saint Jamy,
         	I hold you a penny,
         	A horse and a man
         	Is more than one,
         	And yet not many.
         
         	[Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO]
         
         PETRUCHIO	Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?
         
         BAPTISTA	You are welcome, sir.
         
         PETRUCHIO	And yet I come not well.
         
         BAPTISTA	And yet you halt not.
         
         TRANIO	Not so well apparelled
         	As I wish you were.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Were it better, I should rush in thus.
         	But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
         	How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
         	And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
         	As if they saw some wondrous monument,
         	Some comet or unusual prodigy?
         
         BAPTISTA	Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
         	First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
         	Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
         	Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
         	An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
         
         TRANIO	And tells us, what occasion of import
         	Hath all so long detained you from your wife,
         	And sent you hither so un yourself?
         
         PETRUCHIO	Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
         	Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
         	Though in some part enforced to digress;
         	Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
         	As you shall well be satisfied withal.
         	But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
         	The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
         
         TRANIO	See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
         	Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
         
         BAPTISTA	But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
         	To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
         	Could I repair what she will wear in me,
         	As I can change these poor accoutrements,
         	'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
         	But what a fool am I to chat with you,
         	When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
         	And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
         
         	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO]
         
         TRANIO	He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
         	We will persuade him, be it possible,
         	To put on better ere he go to church.
         
         BAPTISTA	I'll after him, and see the event of this.
         
         	[Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants]
         
         TRANIO	But to her love concerneth us to add
         	Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
         	As I before unparted to your worship,
         	I am to get a man,--whatever he be,
         	It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
         	And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
         	And make assurance here in Padua
         	Of greater sums than I have promised.
         	So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
         	And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
         
         LUCENTIO	Were it not that my fellow-school-master
         	Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
         	'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
         	Which once performed, let all the world say no,
         	I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.
         
         TRANIO	That by degrees we mean to look into,
         	And watch our vantage in this business:
         	We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
         	The narrow-prying father, Minola,
         	The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
         	All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
         
         	[Re-enter GREMIO]
         
         	Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
         
         GREMIO	As willingly as ever I came from school.
         
         TRANIO	And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
         
         GREMIO	A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
         	A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
         
         TRANIO	Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
         
         GREMIO	Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
         
         TRANIO	Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
         
         GREMIO	Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
         	I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
         	Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
         	'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
         	That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
         	And, as he stooped again to take it up,
         	The mad-brained bridegroom took him such a cuff
         	That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
         	'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'
         
         TRANIO	What said the wench when he rose again?
         
         GREMIO	Trembled and shook; for why, he stamped and swore,
         	As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
         	But after many ceremonies done,
         	He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
         	He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
         	After a storm; quaffed off the muscadel
         	And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
         	Having no other reason
         	But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
         	And seemed to ask him sops as he was drinking.
         	This done, he took the bride about the neck
         	And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack
         	That at the parting all the church did echo:
         	And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
         	And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
         	Such a mad marriage never was before:
         	Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.

         PETRUCHIO	Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
         	I know you think to dine with me to-day,
         	And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
         	But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
         	And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
         
         BAPTISTA	Is't possible you will away to-night?
         
         PETRUCHIO	I must away to-day, before night come:
         	Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
         	You would entreat me rather go than stay.
         	And, honest company, I thank you all,
         	That have beheld me give away myself
         	To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
         	Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
         	For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
         
         TRANIO	Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
         
         PETRUCHIO	It may not be.
         
         GREMIO	                  Let me entreat you.
         
         PETRUCHIO	It cannot be.
         
         KATHARINA	                  Let me entreat you.
         
         PETRUCHIO	I am content.
         
         KATHARINA	                  Are you content to stay?
         
         PETRUCHIO	I am content you shall entreat me stay;
         	But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
         
         KATHARINA	Now, if you love me, stay.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Grumio, my horse.
         
         GRUMIO	Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.
         
         KATHARINA	Nay, then,
         	Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
         	No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
         	The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
         	You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
         	For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
         	'Tis  you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
         	That take it on you at the first so roundly.
         
         PETRUCHIO	O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.
         
         KATHARINA	I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
         	Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
         
         GREMIO	Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
         
         KATARINA	Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
         	I see a woman may be made a fool,
         	If she had not a spirit to resist.
         
         PETRUCHIO	They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
         	Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
         	Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
         	Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
         	Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
         	But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
         	Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
         	I will be master of what is mine own:
         	She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
         	My household stuff, my field, my barn,
         	My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
         	And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
         	I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
         	That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
         	Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
         	Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
         	Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
         	thee, Kate:
         	I'll buckler thee against a million.
         
         	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, and GRUMIO]

         LUCENTIO	Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
         
         BIANCA	That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.

         	For to supply the places at the table,
         	You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
         	Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:
         	And let Bianca take her sister's room.

         	[Enter GRUMIO]
         
         GRUMIO	Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
         	all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
         	man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
         	before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
         	warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
         	hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
         	tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
         	belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
         	I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
         	considering the weather, a taller man than I will
         	take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.
         
         	[Enter CURTIS]
         
         CURTIS	Who is that calls so coldly?
         
         GRUMIO	A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
         	from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
         	but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.
         
         CURTIS	Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
         
         GRUMIO	O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
         	on no water.
         
         CURTIS	Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
         
         GRUMIO	She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
         	knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it
         	hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
         	myself, fellow Curtis.
         
         CURTIS	Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
         
         GRUMIO	Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
         	so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
         	fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
         	whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
         	feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?
         
         CURTIS	I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
         
         GRUMIO	A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
         	therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
         	my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
         
         CURTIS	There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.
         
         GRUMIO	Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
         	will thaw.
         
         CURTIS	Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
         
         GRUMIO	Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
         	Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
         	trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
         	serving-men in their new fustian, their white
         	stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
         	Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
         	the carpets laid, and every thing in order?
         
         CURTIS	All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
         
         GRUMIO	First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
         	mistress fallen out.
         
         CURTIS	How?
         
         GRUMIO	Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
         	hangs a tale.
         
         CURTIS	Let's ha't, good Grumio.
         
         GRUMIO	Lend thine ear.
         
         CURTIS	Here.
         
         GRUMIO	There.
         
         	[Strikes him]
         
         CURTIS	This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
         
         GRUMIO	And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
         	cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
         	listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
         	foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--
         
         CURTIS	Both of one horse?
         
         GRUMIO	What's that to thee?
         
         CURTIS	Why, a horse.
         
         GRUMIO	Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
         	thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
         	under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
         	miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
         	with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
         	her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
         	to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
         	that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
         	horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
         	lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
         	which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
         	unexperienced to thy grave.
         
         CURTIS	By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
         
         GRUMIO	Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
         	find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
         	Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
         	Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
         	sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
         	garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
         	with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
         	of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
         	hands. Are they all ready?
         
         CURTIS	They are.
         
         GRUMIO	Call them forth.
         
         CURTIS	Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
         	countenance my mistress.
         
         GRUMIO	Why, she hath a face of her own.
         
         CURTIS	Who knows not that?
         
         GRUMIO	Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
         	countenance her.
         
         CURTIS	I call them forth to credit her.
         
         GRUMIO	Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.

         GRUMIO	E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
         	not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.

         	And Gabriel's pumps were all unpinked i' the heel;
         	There was no link to colour Peter's hat,

         	There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
         	The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
         	Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.

         	The meat was well, if you were so contented.
         
         PETRUCHIO	I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
         	And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
         	For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
         	And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
         	Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
         	Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
         	Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
         	And, for this night, we'll fast for company:

         	And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
         	For then she never looks upon her lure.
         	Another way I have to man my haggard,
         	To make her come and know her keeper's call,
         	That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
         	That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
         	She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
         	Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
         	As with the meat, some undeserved fault
         	I'll find about the making of the bed;
         	And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
         	This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
         	Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
         	That all is done in reverend care of her;
         	And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
         	And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
         	And with the clamour keep her still awake.
         	This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
         	And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
         	He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
         	Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

         SCENE 	Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
         
         
         	[Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO]
         
         TRANIO	Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
         	Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
         	I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
         
         HORTENSIO	Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
         	Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
         
         	[Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO]
         
         LUCENTIO	Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
         
         BIANCA	What, master, read you? first resolve me that.
         
         LUCENTIO	I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
         
         BIANCA	And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
         
         LUCENTIO	While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!
         
         HORTENSIO	Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
         	You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
         	Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.
         
         TRANIO	O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
         	I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
         
         HORTENSIO	Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
         	Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
         	But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
         	For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
         	And makes a god of such a cullion:
         	Know, sir, that I am called Hortensio.
         
         TRANIO	Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
         	Of your entire affection to Bianca;
         	And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
         	I will with you, if you be so contented,
         	Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
         
         HORTENSIO	See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
         	Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
         	Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
         	As one unworthy all the former favours
         	That I have fondly flattered her withal.
         
         TRANIO	And here I take the unfeigned oath,
         	Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
         	Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!
         
         HORTENSIO	Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
         	For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
         	I will be married to a wealthy widow,
         	Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
         	As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
         	And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
         	Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
         	Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
         	In resolution as I swore before.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         TRANIO	Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
         	As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
         	Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
         	And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
         
         BIANCA	Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
         
         TRANIO	Mistress, we have.
         
         LUCENTIO	                  Then we are rid of Licio.
         
         TRANIO	I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
         	That shall be wood and wedded in a day.
         
         BIANCA	God give him joy!
         
         TRANIO	Ay, and he'll tame her.
         
         BIANCA	He says so, Tranio.
         
         TRANIO	Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
         
         BIANCA	The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
         
         TRANIO	Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
         	That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
         	To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
         
         	[Enter BIONDELLO]
         
         BIONDELLO	O master, master, I have watched so long
         	That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
         	An ancient angel coming down the hill,
         	Will serve the turn.
         
         TRANIO	What is he, Biondello?
         
         BIONDELLO	Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
         	I know not what; but format in apparel,
         	In gait and countenance surely  a father.
         
         LUCENTIO	And what of him, Tranio?
         
         TRANIO	If he be credulous and trust my tale,
         	I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
         	And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
         	As if he were the right Vincentio
         	Take in your love, and then let me alone.
         
         	[Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA]
         
         	[Enter a Pedant]
         
         Pedant	God save you, sir!
         
         TRANIO	                  And you, sir! you are welcome.
         	Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
         
         Pedant	Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
         	But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
         	And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
         
         TRANIO	What countryman, I pray?
         
         Pedant	Of Mantua.
         
         TRANIO	Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
         	And come to Padua, careless of your life?
         
         Pedant	My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
         
         TRANIO	'Tis death for any one in Mantua
         	To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
         	Your ships are stayed at Venice, and the duke,
         	For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
         	Hath published and proclaimed it openly:
         	'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
         	You might have heard it else proclaimed about.
         
         Pedant	Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
         	For I have bills for money by exchange
         	From Florence and must here deliver them.
         
         TRANIO	Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
         	This will I do, and this I will advise you:
         	First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
         Pedant	Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
         	Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
         
         TRANIO	Among them know you one Vincentio?
         
         Pedant	I know him not, but I have heard of him;
         	A merchant of incomparable wealth.
         
         TRANIO	He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
         	In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
         
         BIONDELLO	[Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster,
         	and all one.
         
         TRANIO	To save your life in this extremity,
         	This favour will I do you for his sake;
         	And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
         	That you are  to Sir Vincentio.
         	His name and credit shall you undertake,
         	And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
         	Look that you take upon you as you should;
         	You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
         	Till you have done your business in the city:
         	If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
         
         Pedant	O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
         	The patron of my life and liberty.
         
         TRANIO	Then go with me to make the matter good.
         	This, by the way, I let you understand;
         	my father is here looked for every day,
         	To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
         	'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
         	In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
         	Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         	[Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO]
         
         GRUMIO	No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
         
         KATHARINA	The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
         	What, did he marry me to famish me?
         	Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
         	Upon entreaty have a present aims;
         	If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
         	But I, who never knew how to entreat,
         	Nor never needed that I should entreat,
         	Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
         	With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
         	And that which spites me more than all these wants,
         	He does it under name of perfect love;
         	As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
         	'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
         	I prithee go and get me some repast;
         	I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
         
         GRUMIO	What say you to a neat's foot?
         
         KATHARINA	'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.
         
         GRUMIO	I fear it is too choleric a meat.
         	How say you to a fat tripe finely broiled?
         
         KATHARINA	I  it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.
         
         GRUMIO	I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
         	What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
         
         KATHARINA	A dish that I do love to feed upon.
         
         GRUMIO	Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
         
         KATHARINA	Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.
         
         GRUMIO	Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
         	Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
         
         KATHARINA	Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.
         
         GRUMIO	Why then, the mustard without the beef.
         
         KATHARINA	Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
         
         	[Beats him]
         
         	That feedest me with the very name of meat:
         	Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
         	That triumph thus upon my misery!
         	Go, get thee gone, I say.
         
         	[Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat]

         KATHARINA	Faith, as cold as can be.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
         	Here love; thou seeest how diligent I am
         	To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
         	I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
         	What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;
         	And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
         	Here, take away this dish.
         
         KATHARINA	I pray you, let it stand.
         
         PETRUCHIO	The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
         	And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
         
         KATHARINA	I thank you, sir.
         
         HORTENSIO	Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
         	Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
         
         PETRUCHIO	[Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.
         	Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
         	Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,
         	Will we return unto thy father's house
         	And revel it as bravely as the best,
         	With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
         	With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;
         	With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,
         	With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.
         	What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,
         	To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
         
         	[Enter Tailor]
         
         	Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;

         	What news with you, sir?
         
         Haberdasher	Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
         	A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
         	Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
         	A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
         	Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
         
         KATHARINA	I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
         	And gentlewomen wear such caps as these
         
         PETRUCHIO	When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
         	And not till then.
         
         HORTENSIO	[Aside]  That will not be in haste.
         
         KATHARINA	Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
         	And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
         	Your betters have endured me say my mind,
         	And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
         	My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
         	Or else my heart concealing it will break,
         	And rather than it shall, I will be free
         	Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Why, thou sayest true; it is a paltry cap,
         	A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
         	I love thee well, in that thou  it not.
         
         KATHARINA	Love me or love me not, I  the cap;
         	And it I will have, or I will have none.
         
         	[Exit Haberdasher]
         
         PETRUCHIO	Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
         	O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
         	What's this? a sleeve? 'tis  a demi-cannon:
         	What, up and down, carved  an apple-tart?
         	Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
         	 to a censer in a barber's shop:
         	Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, callest thou this?
         
         HORTENSIO	[Aside]  I see she's  to have neither cap nor gown.
         
         Tailor	You bid me make it orderly and well,
         	According to the fashion and the time.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Marry, and did; but if you be remembered,
         	I did not bid you mar it to the time.
         	Go, hop me over every kennel home,
         	For you shall hop without my custom, sir:
         	I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
         
         KATHARINA	I never saw a better-fashioned gown,
         	More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
         	Be you mean to make a puppet of me.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
         
         Tailor	She says your worship means to make
         	a puppet of her.
         
         PETRUCHIO	O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
         	thou thimble,
         	Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
         	Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
         	Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
         	Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
         	Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
         	As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
         	I tell thee, I, that thou hast marred her gown.
         
         Tailor	Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
         	Just as my master had direction:
         	Grumio gave order how it should be done.
         
         GRUMIO	I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
         
         Tailor	But how did you desire it should be made?
         
         GRUMIO	Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
         
         Tailor	But did you not request to have it cut?
         
         GRUMIO	Thou hast faced many things.
         
         Tailor	I have.
         
         GRUMIO	Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
         	me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto
         	thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did
         	not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.
         
         Tailor	Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify
         
         PETRUCHIO	Read it.
         
         GRUMIO	The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
         
         Tailor	[Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'
         
         GRUMIO	Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
         	the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
         	of brown thread: I said a gown.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Proceed.
         
         Tailor	[Reads]  'With a small compassed cape:'
         
         GRUMIO	I confess the cape.
         
         Tailor	[Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve:'
         
         GRUMIO	I confess two sleeves.
         
         Tailor	[Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'
         
         PETRUCHIO	Ay, there's the villany.
         
         GRUMIO	Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
         	I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
         	sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,
         	though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
         
         Tailor	This is true that I say: an I had thee
         	in place where, thou shouldst know it.
         
         GRUMIO	I am for thee straight: take thou the
         	bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.
         
         HORTENSIO	God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
         
         GRUMIO	You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
         
         GRUMIO	Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
         	gown for thy master's use!
         
         PETRUCHIO	Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
         
         GRUMIO	O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
         	Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
         	O, fie, fie, fie!
         
         PETRUCHIO	[Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
         	Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.
         
         HORTENSIO	Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:
         	Take no unkindness of his hasty words:
         	Away! I say; commend me to thy master.
         
         	[Exit Tailor]
         
         PETRUCHIO	Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
         	Even in these honest mean habiliments:
         	Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
         	For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
         	And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
         	So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
         	What is the jay more precious than the lark,
         	Because his fathers are more beautiful?
         	Or is the adder better than the eel,
         	Because his painted skin contents the eye?
         	O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
         	For this poor furniture and mean array.
         	if thou accountest it shame. lay it on me;
         	And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
         	To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
         	Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
         	And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
         	There will we mount, and thither walk on foot
         	Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
         	And well we may come there by dinner-time.
         
         KATHARINA	I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
         	And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
         
         PETRUCHIO	It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
         	Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
         	You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
         	I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
         	It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
         
         HORTENSIO	[Aside]  Why, so this gallant will command the sun.

         TRANIO	Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?
         
         Pedant	Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
         	Signior Baptista may remember me,
         	Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
         	Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
         
         TRANIO	'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
         	With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
         
         Pedant	I warrant you.
         
         	[Enter BIONDELLO]
         
         	But, sir, here comes your boy;
         	'Twere good he were schooled.
         
         TRANIO	Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
         	Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
         	Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
         
         BIONDELLO	Tut, fear not me.
         
         TRANIO	But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
         
         BIONDELLO	I told him that your father was at Venice,
         	And that you looked for him this day in Padua.
         
         TRANIO	Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
         	Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.
         
         	[Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO]
         
         	Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
         
         	[To the Pedant]
         
         	Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
         	I pray you stand good father to me now,
         	Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
         
         Pedant	Soft son!
         	Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
         	To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
         	Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
         	Of love between your daughter and himself:
         	And, for the good report I hear of you
         	And for the love he beareth to your daughter
         	And she to him, to stay him not too long,
         	I am content, in a good father's care,
         	To have him matched; and if you please to 
         	No worse than I, upon some agreement
         	Me shall you find ready and willing
         	With one consent to have her so bestowed;
         	For curious I cannot be with you,
         	Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
         
         BAPTISTA	Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
         	Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
         	Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
         	Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
         	Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
         	And therefore, if you say no more than this,
         	That  a father you will deal with him
         	And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
         	The match is made, and all is done:
         	Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
         
         TRANIO	I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
         	We be affied and such assurance ta'en
         	As shall with either part's agreement stand?
         
         BAPTISTA	Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
         	Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
         	Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
         	And happily we might be interrupted.
         
         TRANIO	Then at my lodging, an it  you:
         	There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
         	We'll pass the business privately and well.
         	Send for your daughter by your servant here:
         	My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
         	The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
         	You are  to have a thin and slender pittance.
         
         BAPTISTA	It s me well. Biondello, hie you home,
         	And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
         	And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
         	Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
         	And how she's  to be Lucentio's wife.
         
         BIONDELLO	I pray the gods she may with all my heart!
         
         TRANIO	Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
         
         	[Exit BIONDELLO]
         
         	Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
         	Welcome! one mess is  to be your cheer:
         	Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
         
         BAPTISTA	I follow you.
         
         	[Exeunt TRANIO, Pedant, and BAPTISTA]
         
         	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]
         
         BIONDELLO	Cambio!
         
         LUCENTIO	What sayest thou, Biondello?
         
         BIONDELLO	You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
         
         LUCENTIO	Biondello, what of that?
         
         BIONDELLO	Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to
         	expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
         
         LUCENTIO	I pray thee, moralize them.
         
         BIONDELLO	Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
         	deceiving father of a deceitful son.
         
         LUCENTIO	And what of him?
         
         BIONDELLO	His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
         
         LUCENTIO	And then?
         
         BIONDELLO	The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
         	command at all hours.
         
         LUCENTIO	And what of all this?
         
         BIONDELLO	I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
         	counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
         	'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
         	church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
         	honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
         	I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
         	ever and a day.
         
         LUCENTIO	Hearest thou, Biondello?
         
         BIONDELLO	I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
         	afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
         	stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
         	sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
         	Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
         	you come with your appendix.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         LUCENTIO	I may, and will, if she be so contented:
         	She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
         	Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
         	It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.

         	Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
         
         KATHARINA	The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
         
         PETRUCHIO	I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
         
         KATHARINA	I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
         	It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
         	Or ere I journey to your father's house.
         	Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
         	Evermore crossed and crossed; nothing but crossed!

         	And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
         	An if you please to call it a rush-candle,

         PETRUCHIO	I say it is the moon.
         
         KATHARINA	I know it is the moon.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.
         
         KATHARINA	Then, God be blessed, it is the blessed sun:
         	But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
         	And the moon changes even as your mind.
         	What you will have it named, even that it is;
         	And so it shall be so for Katharina.

         	Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
         	Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
         	Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
         	What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
         	As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
         	Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
         	Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
         
         HORTENSIO	A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.

         	Happier the man, whom favourable stars
         	Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!

         	This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, withered,
         	And not a maiden, as thou sayest he is.
         
         KATHARINA	Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
         	That have been so bedazzled with the sun

         	Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
         	Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
         	Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
         	We shall be joyful of thy company.
         
         VINCENTIO	Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
         	That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
         	My name is called Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
         	And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
         	A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
         
         PETRUCHIO	What is his name?

         PETRUCHIO	Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
         	And now by law, as well as reverend age,
         	I may entitle thee my loving father:
         	The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
         	Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
         	Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
         	Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
         	Beside, so qualified as may beseem
         	The spouse of any noble gentleman.
         	Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
         	And wander we to see thy honest son,
         	Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
         
         VINCENTIO	But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,

         	Upon the company you overtake?

         PETRUCHIO	Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
         	My father's bears more toward the market-place;
         	Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
         
         VINCENTIO	You shall not choose but drink before you go:
         	I think I shall command your welcome here,
         	And, by all lihood, some cheer is toward.
         
         	[Knocks]
         
         GREMIO	They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
         
         	[Pedant looks out of the window]
         
         Pedant	What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
         
         VINCENTIO	Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
         
         Pedant	He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
         
         VINCENTIO	What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
         	make merry withal?
         
         Pedant	Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
         	need none, so long as I live.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
         	Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
         	I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
         	come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.
         
         Pedant	Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
         	looking out at the window.
         
         VINCENTIO	Art thou his father?
         
         Pedant	Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
         
         PETRUCHIO	[To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman! why, this
         	is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.
         
         Pedant	Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
         	cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
         
         	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]
         
         BIONDELLO	I have seen them in the church together: God send
         	'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
         	master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.
         
         VINCENTIO	[Seeing BIONDELLO]
         
         	Come hither, crack-hemp.
         
         BIONDELLO	Hope I may choose, sir.
         
         VINCENTIO	Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
         
         BIONDELLO	Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
         	never saw you before in all my life.
         
         VINCENTIO	What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
         	thy master's father, Vincentio?
         
         BIONDELLO	What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
         	see where he looks out of the window.
         
         VINCENTIO	Is't so, indeed.
         
         	[Beats BIONDELLO]
         
         BIONDELLO	Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         Pedant	Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
         
         	[Exit from above]
         
         PETRUCHIO	Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
         	this controversy.
         
         	[They retire]
         
         	[Re-enter Pedant below; TRANIO, BAPTISTA, and Servants]
         
         TRANIO	Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
         
         VINCENTIO	What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
         	gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
         	hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
         	am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
         	husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
         	the university.
         
         TRANIO	How now! what's the matter?
         
         BAPTISTA	What, is the man lunatic?
         
         TRANIO	Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
         	habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
         	what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
         	thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.
         
         VINCENTIO	Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
         
         BAPTISTA	You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
         	you think is his name?
         
         VINCENTIO	His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
         	him up ever since he was three years old, and his
         	name is Tranio.
         
         Pedant	Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
         	mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
         
         VINCENTIO	Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
         	on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
         	son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
         
         TRANIO	Call forth an officer.
         
         	[Enter one with an Officer]
         
         	Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
         	I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
         
         VINCENTIO	Carry me to the gaol!
         
         GREMIO	Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.
         
         BAPTISTA	Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
         
         GREMIO	Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
         	cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
         	is the right Vincentio.
         
         Pedant	Swear, if thou darest.
         
         GREMIO	Nay, I dare not swear it.
         
         TRANIO	Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
         
         GREMIO	Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
         
         BAPTISTA	Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
         
         VINCENTIO	Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
         	monstrous villain!
         
         	[Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA]
         
         BIONDELLO	O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
         	forswear him, or else we are all undone.
         
         LUCENTIO	[Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.
         
         VINCENTIO	Lives my sweet son?
         
         	[Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and Pedant, as fast
         	as may be]
         
         BIANCA	Pardon, dear father.
         
         BAPTISTA	How hast thou offended?
         	Where is Lucentio?
         
         LUCENTIO	                  Here's Lucentio,
         	Right son to the right Vincentio;
         	That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
         	While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
         
         GREMIO	Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!
         
         VINCENTIO	Where is that damned villain Tranio,
         	That faced and braved me in this matter so?
         
         BAPTISTA	Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
         
         BIANCA	Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
         
         LUCENTIO	Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
         	Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
         	While he did bear my countenance in the town;
         	And happily I have arrived at the last
         	Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
         	What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
         	Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
         
         VINCENTIO	I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
         	me to the gaol.
         
         BAPTISTA	But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
         	without asking my good will?
         
         VINCENTIO	Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
         	I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BAPTISTA	And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         LUCENTIO	Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
         
         	[Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA]
         
         GREMIO	My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
         	Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KATHARINA	Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.
         
         PETRUCHIO	First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
         
         KATHARINA	What, in the midst of the street?
         
         PETRUCHIO	What, art thou ashamed of me?
         
         KATHARINA	No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
         
         KATHARINA	Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:

         	Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet]
         
         LUCENTIO	At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
         	And time it is, when raging war is done,
         	To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
         	My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
         	While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
         	Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
         	And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
         	Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
         	My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
         	After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
         	For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
         
         BAPTISTA	Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
         
         HORTENSIO	For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
         
         Widow	Then never trust me, if I be afeard.
         
         PETRUCHIO	You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
         	I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
         
         Widow	He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Roundly replied.
         
         KATHARINA	                  Mistress, how mean you that?
         
         Widow	Thus I conceive by him.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Conceives by me! How s Hortensio that?
         
         HORTENSIO	My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
         
         KATHARINA	'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
         	I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
         
         Widow	Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
         	Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
         	And now you know my meaning,
         
         KATHARINA	A very mean meaning.
         
         Widow	Right, I mean you.
         
         KATHARINA	And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
         
         PETRUCHIO	To her, Kate!
         
         HORTENSIO	To her, widow!
         
         PETRUCHIO	A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
         
         HORTENSIO	That's my office.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Spoke  an officer; ha' to thee, lad!
         
         	[Drinks to HORTENSIO]
         
         BAPTISTA	How s Gremio these quick-witted folks?
         
         GREMIO	Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
         
         BIANCA	Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
         	Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
         
         VINCENTIO	Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
         
         BIANCA	Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
         	Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
         
         BIANCA	Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
         	And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
         	You are welcome all.
         
         	[Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow]
         
         PETRUCHIO	She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
         	This bird you aimed at, though you hit her not;
         	Therefore a health to all that shot and missed.
         
         TRANIO	O, sir, Lucentio slipped me  his greyhound,
         	Which runs himself and catches for his master.
         
         PETRUCHIO	A good swift simile, but something currish.
         
         TRANIO	'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
         	'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
         
         BAPTISTA	O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
         
         LUCENTIO	I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
         
         HORTENSIO	Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
         
         PETRUCHIO	A' has a little galled me, I confess;
         	And, as the jest did glance away from me,
         	'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.
         
         BAPTISTA	Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
         	I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
         	Let's each one send unto his wife;
         	And he whose wife is most obedient
         	To come at first when he doth send for her,
         	Shall win the wager which we will propose.
         
         HORTENSIO	Content. What is the wager?
         
         LUCENTIO	Twenty crowns.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Twenty crowns!
         	I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
         	But twenty times so much upon my wife.
         
         LUCENTIO	A hundred then.
         
         HORTENSIO	                  Content.
         
         PETRUCHIO	A match! 'tis done.
         
         HORTENSIO	Who shall begin?
         
         LUCENTIO	                  That will I.
         	Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
         
         BIONDELLO	I go.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BAPTISTA	Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.
         
         LUCENTIO	I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
         
         	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]
         
         	How now! what news?
         
         BIONDELLO	Sir, my mistress sends you word
         	That she is busy and she cannot come.
         
         PETRUCHIO	How! she is busy and she cannot come!
         	Is that an answer?
         
         GREMIO	                  Ay, and a kind one too:
         	Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
         
         PETRUCHIO	I hope better.
         
         HORTENSIO	Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
         	To come to me forthwith.
         
         	[Exit BIONDELLO]
         
         PETRUCHIO	O, ho! entreat her!
         	Nay, then she must needs come.
         
         HORTENSIO	I am afraid, sir,
         	Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
         
         	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]
         
         	Now, where's my wife?
         
         BIONDELLO	She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
         	She will not come: she bids you come to her.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
         	Intolerable, not to be endured!
         	Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
         	Say, I command her to come to me.
         
         	[Exit GRUMIO]
         
         HORTENSIO	I know her answer.
         
         PETRUCHIO	                  What?
         
         HORTENSIO	She will not.
         
         PETRUCHIO	The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
         
         BAPTISTA	Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!

         KATHARINA	What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
         
         PETRUCHIO	Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
         
         KATHARINA	They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
         	Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
         	Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
         
         	[Exit KATHARINA]
         
         LUCENTIO	Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
         
         HORTENSIO	And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
         	And awful rule and right supremacy;
         	And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?
         
         BAPTISTA	Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
         	The wager thou hast won; and I will add
         	Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
         	Another dowry to another daughter,
         	For she is changed, as she had never been.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Nay, I will win my wager better yet
         	And show more sign of her obedience,
         	Her new-built virtue and obedience.
         	See where she comes and brings your froward wives
         	As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
         
         	[Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow]
         
         	Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
         	Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.
         
         Widow	Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
         	Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
         
         BIANCA	Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
         
         LUCENTIO	I would your duty were as foolish too:
         	The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
         	Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
         
         BIANCA	The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
         	What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
         
         Widow	Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
         
         Widow	She shall not.
         
         PETRUCHIO	I say she shall: and first begin with her.
         
         KATHARINA	Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
         	And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
         	To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
         	It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
         	Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
         	And in no sense is meet or amiable.
         	A woman moved is  a fountain troubled,
         	Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
         	And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
         	Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
         	Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
         	Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
         	And for thy maintenance commits his body
         	To painful labour both by sea and land,
         	To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
         	Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
         	And craves no other tribute at thy hands
         	But love, fair looks and true obedience;
         	Too little payment for so great a debt.
         	Such duty as the subject owes the prince
         	Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
         	And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
         	And not obedient to his honest will,
         	What is she but a foul contending rebel
         	And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
         	I am ashamed that women are so simple
         	To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
         	Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
         	When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
         	Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
         	Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
         	But that our soft conditions and our hearts
         	Should well agree with our external parts?
         	Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
         	My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
         	My heart as great, my reason haply more,
         	To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
         	But now I see our lances are but straws,
         	Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
         	That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
         	Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
         	And place your hands below your husband's foot:
         	In token of which duty, if he please,
         	My hand is ready; may it do him ease.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
         
         LUCENTIO	Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.
         
         VINCENTIO	'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
         
         LUCENTIO	But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
         
         PETRUCHIO	Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
         	We three are married, but you two are sped.
         
         	[To LUCENTIO]
         
         	'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
         	And, being a winner, God give you good night!
         
         	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA]
         
         HORTENSIO	Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
         
         LUCENTIO	'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.

         	[Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ESSEX,
         	SALISBURY, and others, with CHATILLON]
         
         KING JOHN	Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
         
         CHATILLON	Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
         	In my behavior to the majesty,
         	The borrowed majesty, of England here.
         
         QUEEN ELINOR	A strange beginning: 'borrowed majesty!'
         
         KING JOHN	Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
         
         CHATILLON	Philip of France, in right and true behalf
         	Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,
         	Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
         	To this fair island and the territories,
         	To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
         	Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
         	Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
         	And put these same into young Arthur's hand,
         	Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
         
         KING JOHN	What follows if we disallow of this?
         
         CHATILLON	The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
         	To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
         
         KING JOHN	Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
         	Controlment for controlment: so answer France.
         
         CHATILLON	Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
         	The farthest limit of my embassy.
         
         KING JOHN	Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:
         	Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
         	For ere thou canst report I will be there,
         	The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:
         	So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
         	And sullen presage of your own decay.

         QUEEN ELINOR	What now, my son! have I not ever said
         	How that ambitious Constance would not cease
         	Till she had kindled France and all the world,
         	Upon the right and party of her son?
         	This might have been prevented and made whole
         	With very easy arguments of love,
         	Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
         	With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
         
         KING JOHN	Our strong possession and our right for us.
         
         QUEEN ELINOR	Your strong possession much more than your right,
         	Or else it must go wrong with you and me:
         	So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
         	Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.

         	[Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD]
         
         		    What men are you?
         
         BASTARD	Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
         	Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,
         	As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,
         	A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
         	Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
         
         KING JOHN	What art thou?
         
         ROBERT	The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
         
         KING JOHN	Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
         	You came not of one mother then, it seems.
         
         BASTARD	Most certain of one mother, mighty king;
         	That is well known; and, as I think, one father:
         	But for the certain knowledge of that truth
         	I put you over to heaven and to my mother:
         	Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.
         
         QUEEN ELINOR	Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
         	And wound her honour with this diffidence.
         
         BASTARD	I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
         	That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
         	The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
         	At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
         	Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
         
         KING JOHN	A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
         	Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
         
         BASTARD	I know not why, except to get the land.
         	But once he slandered me with bastardy:
         	But whether I be as true begot or no,
         	That still I lay upon my mother's head,
         	But that I am as well begot, my liege,--
         	Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
         	Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
         	If old sir Robert did beget us both
         	And were our father and this son  him,
         	O old sir Robert, father, on my knee
         	I give heaven thanks I was not  to thee!
         
         KING JOHN	Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
         
         QUEEN ELINOR	He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
         	The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
         	Do you not read some tokens of my son
         	In the large composition of this man?
         
         KING JOHN	Mine eye hath well examined his parts
         	And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
         	What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
         
         BASTARD	Because he hath a half-face,  my father.
         	With half that face would he have all my land:
         	A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!
         
         ROBERT	My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
         	Your brother did employ my father much,--
         
         BASTARD	Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
         	Your tale must be how he employed my mother.
         
         ROBERT	And once dispatched him in an embassy
         	To Germany, there with the emperor
         	To treat of high affairs touching that time.
         	The advantage of his absence took the king
         	And in the mean time sojourned at my father's;
         	Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
         	But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
         	Between my father and my mother lay,
         	As I have heard my father speak himself,
         	When this same lusty gentleman was got.
         	Upon his death-bed he by will bequeathed
         	His lands to me, and took it on his death
         	That this my mother's son was none of his;
         	And if he were, he came into the world
         	Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
         	Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
         	My father's land, as was my father's will.
         
         KING JOHN	Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
         	Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
         	And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
         	Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
         	That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
         	Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
         	Had of your father claimed this son for his?
         	In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
         	This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
         	In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,
         	My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
         	Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;
         	My mother's son did get your father's heir;
         	Your father's heir must have your father's land.
         
         ROBERT	Shall then my father's will be of no force
         	To dispossess that child which is not his?
         
         BASTARD	Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
         	Than was his will to get me, as I think.
         
         QUEEN ELINOR	Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
         	And  thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
         	Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,
         	Lord of thy presence and no land beside?
         
         BASTARD	Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
         	And I had his, sir Robert's his,  him;
         	And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
         	My arms such eel-skins stuffed, my face so thin
         	That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
         	Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'
         	And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
         	Would I might never stir from off this place,
         	I would give it every foot to have this face;
         	I would not be sir Nob in any case.
         
         QUEEN ELINOR	I  thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
         	Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
         	I am a soldier and now bound to France.
         
         BASTARD	Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
         	Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
         	Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
         	Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.
         
         QUEEN ELINOR	Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
         
         BASTARD	Our country manners give our betters way.
         
         KING JOHN	What is thy name?
         
         BASTARD	Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
         	Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.
         
         KING JOHN	From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
         	Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,
         	Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.
         
         BASTARD	Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:
         	My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
         	Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,
         	When I was got, sir Robert was away!
         
         QUEEN ELINOR	The very spirit of Plantagenet!
         	I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.
         
         BASTARD	Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
         	Something about, a little from the right,
         	In at the window, or else over the hatch:
         	Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
         	And have is have, however men do catch:
         	Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
         	And I am I, however I was begot.
         
         KING JOHN	Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;
         	A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
         	Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
         	For France, for France, for it is more than need.
         
         BASTARD	Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
         	For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
         
         	[Exeunt all but BASTARD]
         
         	A foot of honour better than I was;
         	But many a many foot of land the worse.
         	Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
         	'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--
         	And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
         	For new-made honour doth forget men's names;
         	'Tis too respective and too sociable
         	For your conversion. Now your traveller,
         	He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
         	And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
         	Why then I suck my teeth and catechise
         	My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
         	Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
         	'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;
         	And then comes answer  an Absey book:
         	'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;
         	At your employment; at your service, sir;'
         	'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
         	And so, ere answer knows what question would,
         	Saving in dialogue of compliment,
         	And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
         	The Pyrenean and the river Po,
         	It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
         	But this is worshipful society
         	And fits the mounting spirit  myself,
         	For he is but a bastard to the time
         	That doth not smack of observation;
         	And so am I, whether I smack or no;
         	And not alone in habit and device,
         	Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
         	But from the inward motion to deliver
         	Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
         	Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
         	Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
         	For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
         	But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
         	What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
         	That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
         
         	[Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY]
         
         	O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!
         	What brings you here to court so hastily?
         
         LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,
         	That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
         
         BASTARD	My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?
         	Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
         	Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?
         
         LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
         	Sir Robert's son: why scornest thou at sir Robert?
         	He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.
         
         BASTARD	James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
         
         GURNEY	Good leave, good Philip.
         
         BASTARD	Philip! sparrow: James,
         	There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
         
         	[Exit GURNEY]
         
         	Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
         	Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
         	Upon Good-Friday and never broke his fast:
         	Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,
         	Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:
         	We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
         	To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
         	Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
         
         LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
         	That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
         	What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?
         
         BASTARD	Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-.
         	What! I am dubbed! I have it on my shoulder.
         	But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;
         	I have disclaimed sir Robert and my land;
         	Legitimation, name and all is gone:
         	Then, good my mother, let me know my father;
         	Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?
         
         LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
         
         BASTARD	As faithfully as I deny the devil.
         
         LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:
         	By long and vehement suit I was seduced
         	To make room for him in my husband's bed:
         	Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
         	Thou art the issue of my dear offence,
         	Which was so strongly urged past my defence.
         
         BASTARD	Now, by this light, were I to get again,
         	Madam, I would not wish a better father.
         	Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
         	And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:
         	Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
         	Subjected tribute to commanding love,
         	Against whose fury and unmatched force
         	The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
         	Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
         	He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
         	May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,
         	With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
         	Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
         	When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
         	Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
         	And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
         	If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:
         	Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.

         LEWIS	Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
         	Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
         	Richard, that robbed the lion of his heart
         	And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
         	By this brave duke came early to his grave:
         	And for amends to his posterity,
         	At our importance hither is he come,
         	To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,
         	And to rebuke the usurpation
         	Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:
         	Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.
         
         ARTHUR	God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
         	The rather that you give his offspring life,
         	Shadowing their right under your wings of war:
         	I give you welcome with a powerless hand,
         	But with a heart full of unstained love:
         	Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.
         
         LEWIS	A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
         
         AUSTRIA	Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
         	As seal to this indenture of my love,
         	That to my home I will no more return,
         	Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,
         	Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,
         	Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
         	And coops from other lands her islanders,
         	Even till that England, hedged in with the main,
         	That water-walled bulwark, still secure
         	And confident from foreign purposes,
         	Even till that utmost corner of the west
         	Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
         	Will I not think of home, but follow arms.
         
         CONSTANCE	O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
         	Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength

         AUSTRIA	The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
         	In such a just and charitable war.
         
         KING PHILIP	Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent
         	Against the brows of this resisting town.
         	Call for our chiefest men of discipline,
         	To cull the plots of best advantages:
         	We'll lay before this town our royal bones,
         	Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,
         	But we will make it subject to this boy.
         
         CONSTANCE	Stay for an answer to your embassy,
         	Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:
         	My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,
         	That right in peace which here we urge in war,
         	And then we shall repent each drop of blood
         	That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.

         KING PHILIP	A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,
         	Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!
         	What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;
         	We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.
         
         CHATILLON	Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
         	And stir them up against a mightier task.
         	England, impatient of your just demands,
         	Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,
         	Whose leisure I have stayed, have given him time
         	To land his legions all as soon as I;
         	His marches are expedient to this town,
         	His forces strong, his soldiers confident.
         	With him along is come the mother-queen,
         	An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
         	With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;
         	With them a bastard of the king's deceased,
         	And all the unsettled humours of the land,
         	Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
         	With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,
         	Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
         	Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
         	To make hazard of new fortunes here:
         	In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits
         	Than now the English bottoms have waft over
         	Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,
         	To do offence and scath in Christendom.
         
         	[Drum beats]
         
         	The interruption of their churlish drums
         	Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,
         	To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.
         
         KING PHILIP	How much unlooked for is this expedition!
         
         AUSTRIA	By how much unexpected, by so much
         	We must awake endavour for defence;

         	Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct
         	Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.
         
         KING PHILIP	Peace be to England, if that war return
         	From France to England, there to live in peace.
         	England we love; and for that England's sake
         	With burden of our armour here we sweat.
         	This toil of ours should be a work of thine;
         	But thou from loving England art so far,
         	That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king
         	Cut off the sequence of posterity,
         	Out-faced infant state and done a rape
         	Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
         	Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;
         	These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:
         	This little abstract doth contain that large
         	Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time
         	Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
         	That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
         	And this his son; England was Geffrey's right
         	And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God
         	How comes it then that thou art called a king,
         	When living blood doth in these temples beat,
         	Which owe the crown that thou overmasterest?

         KING PHILIP	From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts
         	In any breast of strong authority,
         	To look into the blots and stains of right:
         	That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:
         	Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
         	And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
         
         KING JOHN	Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
         
         KING PHILIP	Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.

         	On this removed issue, plague for her
         	And with her plague; her sin his injury,
         	Her injury the beadle to her sin,

         	To these ill-tuned repetitions.
         	Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
         	These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak
         	Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.
         
         	[Trumpet sounds. Enter certain Citizens upon the walls]
         
         First Citizen	Who is it that hath warned us to the walls?
         
         KING PHILIP	'Tis France, for England.
         
         KING JOHN	England, for itself.
         	You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects--
         
         KING PHILIP	You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
         	Our trumpet called you to this gentle parle--
         
         KING JOHN	For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
         	These flags of France, that are advanced here
         	Before the eye and prospect of your town,
         	Have hither marched to your endamagement:
         	The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
         	And ready mounted are they to spit forth
         	Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
         	All preparation for a bloody siege
         	All merciless proceeding by these French
         	Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
         	And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
         	That as a waist doth girdle you about,
         	By the compulsion of their ordinance
         	By this time from their fixed beds of lime
         	Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
         	For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
         	But on the sight of us your lawful king,
         	Who painfully with much expedient march
         	Have brought a countercheque before your gates,
         	To save unscratched your city's threatened cheeks,
         	Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;
         	And now, instead of bullets wrapped in fire,
         	To make a shaking fever in your walls,
         	They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
         	To make a faithless error in your ears:
         	Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
         	And let us in, your king, whose laboured spirits,
         	Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
         	Crave harbourage within your city walls.
         
         KING PHILIP	When I have said, make answer to us both.
         	Lo, in this right hand, whose protection
         	Is most divinely vowed upon the right
         	Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,
         	Son to the elder brother of this man,
         	And king over him and all that he enjoys:
         	For this down-trodden equity, we tread
         	In war march these greens before your town,
         	Being no further enemy to you
         	Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
         	In the relief of this oppressed child
         	Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
         	To pay that duty which you truly owe
         	To that owes it, namely this young prince:
         	And then our arms,  to a muzzled bear,
         	Save in aspect, hath all offence sealed up;
         	Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
         	Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;
         	And with a blessed and unvexed retire,
         	With unhacked swords and helmets all unbruised,
         	We will bear home that lusty blood again
         	Which here we came to spout against your town,
         	And leave your children, wives and you in peace.
         	But if you fondly pass our proffered offer,
         	'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls
         	Can hide you from our messengers of war,
         	Though all these English and their discipline
         	Were harboured in their rude circumference.
         	Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,
         	In that behalf which we have challenged it?
         	Or shall we give the signal to our rage
         	And stalk in blood to our possession?
         
         First Citizen	In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:
         	For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
         
         KING JOHN	Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.
         
         First Citizen	That can we not; but he that proves the king,
         	To him will we prove loyal: till that time
         	Have we rammed up our gates against the world.
         
         KING JOHN	Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
         	And if not that, I bring you witnesses,
         	Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--
         
         BASTARD	Bastards, and else.
         
         KING JOHN	To verify our title with their lives.
         
         KING PHILIP	As many and as well-born bloods as those,--
         
         BASTARD	Some bastards too.
         
         KING PHILIP	Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
         
         First Citizen	Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
         	We for the worthiest hold the right from both.
         
         KING JOHN	Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
         	That to their everlasting residence,
         	Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,
         	In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!
         
         KING PHILIP	Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!
         
         BASTARD	Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and ever since
         	Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,
         	Teach us some fence!
         
         	[To AUSTRIA]
         
         		Sirrah, were I at home,
         	At your den, sirrah, with your lioness
         	I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,
         	And make a monster of you.
         
         AUSTRIA	Peace! no more.
         
         BASTARD	O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.
         
         KING JOHN	Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth
         	In best appointment all our regiments.
         
         BASTARD	Speed then, to take advantage of the field.
         
         KING PHILIP	It shall be so; and at the other hill
         	Command the rest to stand. God and our right!
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         	[Here after excursions, enter the Herald of France,
         	with trumpets, to the gates]
         
         French Herald	You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,
         	And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,
         	Who by the hand of France this day hath made
         	Much work for tears in many an English mother,
         	Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;
         	Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,
         	Coldly embracing the discoloured earth;
         	And victory, with little loss, doth play
         	Upon the dancing banners of the French,
         	Who are at hand, triumphantly displayed,
         	To enter conquerors and to proclaim
         	Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.
         
         	[Enter English Herald, with trumpet]
         
         English Herald	Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
         	King John, your king and England's doth approach,
         	Commander of this hot malicious day:
         	Their armours, that marched hence so silver-bright,
         	Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;
         	There stuck no plume in any English crest
         	That is removed by a staff of France;
         	Our colours do return in those same hands
         	That did display them when we first marched forth;
         	And,  a troop of jolly huntsmen, come
         	Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,
         	Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
         	Open your gates and gives the victors way.
         
         First Citizen	Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,
         	From first to last, the onset and retire
         	Of both your armies; whose equality
         	By our best eyes cannot be censured:
         	Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;
         	Strength matched with strength, and power confronted power:
         	Both are a; and both a we .
         	One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,
         	We hold our town for neither, yet for both.
         
         	[Re-enter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP, with their
         	powers, severally]
         
         KING JOHN	France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
         	Say, shall the current of our right run on?
         	Whose passage, vexed with thy impediment,
         	Shall leave his native channel and overswell
         	With course disturbed even thy confining shores,
         	Unless thou let his silver water keep
         	A peaceful progress to the ocean.
         
         KING PHILIP	England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
         	In this hot trial, more than we of France;
         	Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
         	That sways the earth this climate overlooks,
         	Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,
         	We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,
         	Or add a royal number to the dead,
         	Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
         	With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.
         
         BASTARD	Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,
         	When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
         	O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;
         	The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
         	And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
         	In undetermined differences of kings.
         	Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
         	Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,
         	You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
         	Then let confusion of one part confirm
         	The other's peace: till then, blows, blood and death!
         
         KING JOHN	Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
         
         KING PHILIP	Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
         
         First Citizen	The king of England; when we know the king.
         
         KING PHILIP	Know him in us, that here hold up his right.
         
         KING JOHN	In us, that are our own great deputy
         	And bear possession of our person here,
         	Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.
         
         First Citizen	A greater power then we denies all this;
         	And till it be undoubted, we do lock
         	Our former scruple in our strong-barred gates;
         	Kinged of our fears, until our fears, resolved,
         	Be by some certain king purged and deposed.
         
         BASTARD	By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
         	And stand securely on their battlements,
         	As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
         	At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
         	Your royal presences be ruled by me:
         	Do  the mutines of Jerusalem,
         	Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
         	Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
         	By east and west let France and England mount
         	Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
         	Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawled down
         	The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
         	I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
         	Even till unfenced desolation
         	Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
         	That done, dissever your united strengths,
         	And part your mingled colours once again;
         	Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
         	Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
         	Out of one side her happy minion,
         	To whom in favour she shall give the day,
         	And kiss him with a glorious victory.
         	How  you this wild counsel, mighty states?
         	Smacks it not something of the policy?
         
         KING JOHN	Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
         	I  it well. France, shall we knit our powers
         	And lay this Angiers even to the ground;
         	Then after fight who shall be king of it?
         
         BASTARD	An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
         	Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,
         	Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
         	As we will ours, against these saucy walls;
         	And when that we have dashed them to the ground,
         	Why then defy each other and pell-mell
         	Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.
         
         KING PHILIP	Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
         
         KING JOHN	We from the west will send destruction
         	Into this city's bosom.
         
         AUSTRIA	I from the north.
         
         KING PHILIP	                  Our thunder from the south
         	Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
         
         BASTARD	O prudent discipline! From north to south:
         	Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:
         	I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!
         
         First Citizen	Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
         	And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;
         	Win you this city without stroke or wound;
         	Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
         	That here come sacrifices for the field:
         	Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.
         
         KING JOHN	Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
         
         First Citizen	That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
         	Is niece to England: look upon the years
         	Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:
         	If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
         	Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
         	If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
         	Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
         	If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
         	Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
         	Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
         	Is the young Dauphin every way complete:
         	If not complete of, say he is not she;
         	And she again wants nothing, to name want,
         	If want it be not that she is not he:
         	He is the half part of a blessed man,
         	Left to be finished by such as she;
         	And she a fair divided excellence,
         	Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
         	O, two such silver currents, when they join,
         	Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
         	And two such shores to two such streams made one,
         	Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
         	To these two princes, if you marry them.
         	This union shall do more than battery can
         	To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
         	With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
         	The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,
         	And give you entrance: but without this match,
         	The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
         	Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
         	More free from motion, no, not Death himself
         	In moral fury half so peremptory,
         	As we to keep this city.
         
         BASTARD	Here's a stay
         	That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
         	Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
         	That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,
         	Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
         	As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
         	What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
         	He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;
         	He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
         	Our ears are cudgelled; not a word of his
         	But buffets better than a fist of France:
         	Zounds! I was never so bethumped with words
         	Since I first called my brother's father dad.
         
         QUEEN ELINOR	Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
         	Give with our niece a dowry large enough:
         	For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
         	Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,
         	That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
         	The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
         	I see a yielding in the looks of France;
         	Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls
         	Are capable of this ambition,
         	Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
         	Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
         	Cool and congeal again to what it was.
         
         First Citizen	Why answer not the double majesties
         	This friendly treaty of our threatened town?
         
         KING PHILIP	Speak England first, that hath been forward first
         	To speak unto this city: what say you?
         
         KING JOHN	If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
         	Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'
         	Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:
         	For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,
         	And all that we upon this side the sea,
         	Except this city now by us besieged,
         	Find liable to our crown and dignity,
         	Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
         	In titles, honours and promotions,
         	As she in beauty, education, blood,
         	Holds hand with any princess of the world.
         
         KING PHILIP	What sayest thou, boy? look in the lady's face.
         
         LEWIS	I do, my lord; and in her eye I find
         	A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
         	The shadow of myself formed in her eye:
         	Which being but the shadow of your son,
         	Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:
         	I do protest I never loved myself
         	Till now infixed I beheld myself
         	Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
         
         	[Whispers with BLANCH]
         
         BASTARD	Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
         	Hanged in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
         	And quartered in her heart! he doth espy
         	Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,
         	That hanged and drawn and quartered, there should be
         	In such a love so vile a lout as he.
         
         BLANCH	My uncle's will in this respect is mine:
         	If he see aught in you that makes him ,
         	That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,
         	I can with ease translate it to my will;
         	Or if you will, to speak more properly,
         	I will enforce it easily to my love.
         	Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
         	That all I see in you is worthy love,
         	Than this; that nothing do I see in you,
         	Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,
         	That I can find should merit any hate.
         
         KING JOHN	What say these young ones? What say you my niece?
         
         BLANCH	That she is bound in honour still to do
         	What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.
         
         KING JOHN	Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?

         	For I do love her most unfeignedly.
         
         KING JOHN	Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
         	Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,
         	With her to thee; and this addition more,
         	Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
         	Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
         	Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
         
         KING PHILIP	It s us well; young princes, close your hands.
         
         AUSTRIA	And your lips too; for I am well assured
         	That I did so when I was first assured.
         
         KING PHILIP	Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
         	Let in that amity which you have made;
         	For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
         	The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.
         	Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
         	I know she is not, for this match made up
         	Her presence would have interrupted much:
         	Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.
         
         LEWIS	She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.
         
         KING PHILIP	And, by my faith, this league that we have made
         	Will give her sadness very little cure.
         	Brother of England, how may we content
         	This widow lady? In her right we came;
         	Which we, God knows, have turned another way,
         	To our own vantage.
         
         KING JOHN	We will heal up all;
         	For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne
         	And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
         	We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;
         	Some speedy messenger bid her repair
         	To our solemnity: I trust we shall,
         	If not fill up the measure of her will,
         	Yet in some measure satisfy her so
         	That we shall stop her exclamation.
         	Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
         	To this unlooked for, unprepared pomp.

         	Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
         	As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
         	With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
         	That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
         	That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
         	Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
         	Who, having no external thing to lose
         	But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,
         	That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
         	Commodity, the bias of the world,
         	The world, who of itself is peised well,
         	Made to run even upon even ground,
         	Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
         	This sway of motion, this Commodity,
         	Makes it take head from all indifferency,
         	From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
         	And this same bias, this Commodity,
         	This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
         	Clapped on the outward eye of fickle France,
         	Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
         	From a resolved and honourable war,
         	To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
         	And why rail I on this Commodity?
         	But for because he hath not wooed me yet:
         	Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,
         	When his fair angels would salute my palm;
         	But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
         	 a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
         	Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
         	And say there is no sin but to be rich;
         	And being rich, my virtue then shall be
         	To say there is no vice but beggary.
         	Since kings break faith upon commodity,
         	Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.

         	I have a king's oath to the contrary.
         	Thou shalt be punished for thus frighting me,

         	Heaven knows, they were besmeared and over-stained
         	With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
         	The fearful difference of incensed kings:
         	And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,
         	So newly joined in love, so strong in both,
         	Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
         	Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,

         	Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
         	Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
         	And make a riot on the gentle brow
         	Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
         	My reverend father, let it not be so!
         	Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
         	Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest
         	To do your pleasure and continue friends.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	All form is formless, order orderless,
         	Save what is opposite to England's love.
         	Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,
         	Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,
         	A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
         	France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
         	A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
         	A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
         	Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
         
         KING PHILIP	I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;
         	And  a civil war setest oath to oath,
         	Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
         	First made to heaven, first be to heaven performed,
         	That is, to be the champion of our church!
         	What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
         	And may not be performed by thyself,
         	For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
         	Is not amiss when it is truly done,
         	And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
         	The truth is then most done not doing it:
         	The better act of purposes mistook
         	Is to mistake again; though indirect,
         	Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
         	And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
         	Within the scorched veins of one new-burned.
         	It is religion that doth make vows kept;
         	But thou hast sworn against religion,
         	By what thou swearest against the thing thou swearest,
         	And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
         	Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
         	To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
         	Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
         	But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
         	And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
         	Therefore thy later vows against thy first
         	Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
         	And better conquest never canst thou make
         	Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
         	Against these giddy loose suggestions:
         	Upon which better part our prayers come in,
         	If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
         	The peril of our curses light on thee
         	So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
         	But in despair die under their black weight.

         KING JOHN	Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
         	We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh
         	There is a soul counts thee her creditor
         	And with advantage means to pay thy love:
         	And my good friend, thy voluntary oath
         	Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
         	Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,
         	But I will fit it with some better time.
         	By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed
         	To say what good respect I have of thee.
         
         HUBERT	I am much bounden to your majesty.
         
         KING JOHN	Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
         	But thou shalt have; and creep time never so slow,
         	Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.
         	I had a thing to say, but let it go:
         	The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
         	Attended with the pleasures of the world,
         	Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
         	To give me audience: if the midnight bell
         	Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
         	Sound on into the drowsy race of night;
         	If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
         	And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,
         	Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
         	Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
         	Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
         	Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
         	And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
         	A passion hateful to my purposes,
         	Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
         	Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
         	Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
         	Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;
         	Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
         	I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
         	But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;
         	And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.
         
         HUBERT	So well, that what you bid me undertake,
         	Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
         	By heaven, I would do it.
         
         KING JOHN	Do not I know thou wouldst?
         	Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
         	On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
         	He is a very serpent in my way;
         	And wheresover this foot of mine doth tread,
         	He lies before me: dost thou understand me?
         	Thou art his keeper.
         
         HUBERT	And I'll keep him so,
         	That he shall not offend your majesty.
         
         KING JOHN	Death.

         HUBERT	                  He shall not live.
         
         KING JOHN	Enough.
         	I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;
         	Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:
         	Remember. Madam, fare you well:
         	I'll send those powers over to your majesty.

         	And ring these fingers with thy household worms
         	And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
         	And be a carrion monster  thyself:
         	Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest
         	And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,

         CONSTANCE	No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:
         	O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!
         	Then with a passion would I shake the world;
         	And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
         	Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,
         	Which scorns a modern invocation.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.
         
         CONSTANCE	Thou art not holy to belie me so;
         	I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
         	My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
         	Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:
         	I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
         	For then, 'tis  I should forget myself:
         	O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
         	Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
         	And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;
         	For being not mad but sensible of grief,
         	My reasonable part produces reason
         	How I may be delivered of these woes,
         	And teaches me to kill or hang myself:
         	If I were mad, I should forget my son,
         	Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:
         	I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
         	The different plague of each calamity.
         
         KING PHILIP	Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
         	In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
         	Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,
         	Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
         	Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
         	 true, inseparable, faithful loves,
         	Sticking together in calamity.
         
         CONSTANCE	To England, if you will.
         
         KING PHILIP	Bind up your hairs.
         
         CONSTANCE	Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
         	I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
         	'O that these hands could so redeem my son,
         	As they have given these hairs their liberty!'
         	But now I envy at their liberty,
         	And will again commit them to their bonds,
         	Because my poor child is a prisoner.
         	And, father cardinal, I have heard you say
         	That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:
         	If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
         	For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
         	To him that did but yesterday suspire,
         	There was not such a gracious creature born.
         	But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
         	And chase the native beauty from his cheek
         	And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
         	As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,
         	And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
         	When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
         	I shall not know him: therefore never, never
         	Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
         
         CONSTANCE	He talks to me that never had a son.
         
         KING PHILIP	You are as fond of grief as of your child.
         
         CONSTANCE	Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
         	Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
         	Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
         	Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
         	Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
         	Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?
         	Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,
         	I could give better comfort than you do.
         	I will not keep this form upon my head,
         	When there is such disorder in my wit.
         	O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
         	My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!
         	My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING PHILIP	I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         LEWIS	There's nothing in this world can make me joy:
         	Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
         	Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
         	And bitter shame hath spoiled the sweet world's taste
         	That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	Before the curing of a strong disease,
         	Even in the instant of repair and health,
         	The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,
         	On their departure most of all show evil:
         	What have you lost by losing of this day?
         
         LEWIS	All days of glory, joy and happiness.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	If you had won it, certainly you had.
         	No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
         	She looks upon them with a threatening eye.
         	'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
         	In this which he accounts so clearly won:
         	Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?
         
         LEWIS	As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
         	Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
         	For even the breath of what I mean to speak
         	Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
         	Out of the path which shall directly lead
         	Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.
         	John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be
         	That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
         	The misplaced John should entertain an hour,
         	One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
         	A sceptre snatched with an unruly hand
         	Must be as boisterously maintained as gained;
         	And he that stands upon a slippery place
         	Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:
         	That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;
         	So be it, for it cannot be but so.
         
         LEWIS	But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
         	May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
         
         LEWIS	And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	How green you are and fresh in this old world!
         	John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
         	For he that steeps his safety in true blood
         	Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
         	This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
         	Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
         	That none so small advantage shall step forth
         	To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;
         	No natural exhalation in the sky,
         	No scope of nature, no distempered day,
         	No common wind, no customed event,
         	But they will pluck away his natural cause
         	And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,
         	Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,
         	Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
         
         LEWIS	May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
         	But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
         	If that young Arthur be not gone already,
         	Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
         	Of all his people shall revolt from him
         	And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
         	And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
         	Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
         	Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
         	And, O, what better matter breeds for you
         	Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
         	Is now in England, ransacking the church,
         	Offending charity: if but a dozen French
         	Were there in arms, they would be as a call
         	To train ten thousand English to their side,
         	Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
         	Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
         	Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful
         	What may be wrought out of their discontent,
         	Now that their souls are topful of offence.
         	For England go: I will whet on the king.
         
         LEWIS	Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:
         	If you say ay, the king will not say no.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         SCENE I	A room in a castle.
         
         
         	[Enter HUBERT and Executioners]
         
         HUBERT	Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
         	Within the arras: when I strike my foot
         	Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,
         	And bind the boy which you shall find with me
         	Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.
         
         First Executioner	I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
         
         HUBERT	Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.
         
         	[Exeunt Executioners]
         
         	Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.
         
         	[Enter ARTHUR]
         
         ARTHUR	Good morrow, Hubert.
         
         HUBERT	Good morrow, little prince.
         
         ARTHUR	As little prince, having so great a title
         	To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.
         
         HUBERT	Indeed, I have been merrier.
         
         ARTHUR	Mercy on me!
         	Methinks no body should be sad but I:
         	Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
         	Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
         	Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
         	So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
         	I should be as merry as the day is long;
         	And so I would be here, but that I doubt
         	My uncle practises more harm to me:
         	He is afraid of me and I of him:
         	Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
         	No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven
         	I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.
         
         HUBERT	[Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
         	He will awake my mercy which lies dead:
         	Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
         
         ARTHUR	Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:
         	In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
         	That I might sit all night and watch with you:
         	I warrant I love you more than you do me.
         
         HUBERT	[Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.
         	Read here, young Arthur.
         
         	[Showing a paper]
         
         	[Aside]
         
         		   How now, foolish rheum!
         	Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
         	I must be brief, lest resolution drop
         	Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.
         	Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?
         
         ARTHUR	Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:
         	Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?
         
         HUBERT	Young boy, I must.
         
         ARTHUR	                  And will you?
         
         HUBERT	And I will.
         
         ARTHUR	Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
         	I knit my handercher about your brows,
         	The best I had, a princess wrought it me,
         	And I did never ask it you again;
         	And with my hand at midnight held your head,
         	And  the watchful minutes to the hour,
         	Still and anon cheered up the heavy time,
         	Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'
         	Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
         	Many a poor man's son would have lien still
         	And never have spoke a loving word to you;
         	But you at your sick service had a prince.
         	Nay, you may think my love was crafty love
         	And call it cunning: do, an if you will:
         	If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,
         	Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
         	These eyes that never did nor never shall
         	So much as frown on you.
         
         HUBERT	I have sworn to do it;
         	And with hot irons must I burn them out.
         
         ARTHUR	Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
         	The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
         	Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears
         	And quench his fiery indignation
         	Even in the matter of mine innocence;
         	Nay, after that, consume away in rust
         	But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
         	Are you more stubborn-hard than hammered iron?
         	An if an angel should have come to me
         	And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
         	I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.
         
         HUBERT	Come forth.
         
         	[Stamps]
         
         	[Re-enter Executioners, with a cord, irons, &amp;c]
         
         	Do as I bid you do.
         
         ARTHUR	O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out
         	Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.
         
         HUBERT	Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
         
         ARTHUR	Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?
         	I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.
         	For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
         	Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,
         	And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
         	I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,
         	Nor look upon the iron angerly:
         	Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,
         	Whatever torment you do put me to.
         
         HUBERT	Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
         
         First Executioner	I am best pleased to be from such a deed.
         
         	[Exeunt Executioners]
         
         ARTHUR	Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
         	He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:
         	Let him come back, that his compassion may
         	Give life to yours.
         
         HUBERT	Come, boy, prepare yourself.
         
         ARTHUR	Is there no remedy?
         
         HUBERT	None, but to lose your eyes.
         
         ARTHUR	O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
         	A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
         	Any annoyance in that precious sense!
         	Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,
         	Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
         
         HUBERT	Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.
         
         ARTHUR	Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
         	Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:
         	Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;
         	Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
         	So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.
         	Though to no use but still to look on you!
         	Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold
         	And would not harm me.
         
         HUBERT	I can heat it, boy.
         
         ARTHUR	No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,
         	Being create for comfort, to be used
         	In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;
         	There is no malice in this burning coal;
         	The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
         	And strewed repentent ashes on his head.
         
         HUBERT	But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
         
         ARTHUR	An if you do, you will but make it blush
         	And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:
         	Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;
         	And  a dog that is compelled to fight,
         	Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
         	All things that you should use to do me wrong
         	Deny their office: only you do lack
         	That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,
         	Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.
         
         HUBERT	Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
         	For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:
         	Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,
         	With this same very iron to burn them out.
         
         ARTHUR	O, now you look  Hubert! all this while
         	You were disguised.
         
         HUBERT	Peace; no more. Adieu.
         	Your uncle must not know but you are dead;
         	I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:
         	And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,
         	That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,
         	Will not offend thee.
         
         ARTHUR	O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.
         
         HUBERT	Silence; no more: go closely in with me:
         	Much danger do I undergo for thee.

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	KING JOHN'S palace.
         
         
         	[Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other Lords]
         
         KING JOHN	Here once again we sit, once again crowned,
         	And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
         
         PEMBROKE	This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,
         	Was once superfluous: you were crowned before,
         	And that high royalty was never plucked off,
         	The faiths of men never stained with revolt;
         	Fresh expectation troubled not the land
         	With any longed-for change or better state.
         
         SALISBURY	Therefore, to be possessed with double pomp,
         	To guard a title that was rich before,
         	To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
         	To throw a perfume on the violet,
         	To smooth the ice, or add another hue
         	Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
         	To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
         	Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
         
         PEMBROKE	But that your royal pleasure must be done,
         	This act is as an ancient tale new told,
         	And in the last repeating troublesome,
         	Being urged at a time unseasonable.
         
         SALISBURY	In this the antique and well noted face
         	Of plain old form is much disfigured;
         	And,  a shifted wind unto a sail,
         	It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
         	Startles and frights consideration,
         	Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,
         	For putting on so new a fashioned robe.
         
         PEMBROKE	When workmen strive to do better than well,
         	They do confound their skill in covetousness;
         	And oftentimes excusing of a fault
         	Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
         	As patches set upon a little breach
         	Discredit more in hiding of the fault
         	Than did the fault before it was so patched.
         
         SALISBURY	To this effect, before you were new crowned,
         	We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness
         	To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,
         	Since all and every part of what we would
         	Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
         
         KING JOHN	Some reasons of this double coronation
         	I have possessed you with and think them strong;
         	And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,
         	I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
         	What you would have reformed that is not well,
         	And well shall you perceive how willingly
         	I will both hear and grant you your requests.
         
         PEMBROKE	Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,
         	To sound the purpose of all their hearts,
         	Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,
         	Your safety, for the which myself and them
         	Bend their best studies, heartily request
         	The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint
         	Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
         	To break into this dangerous argument,--
         	If what in rest you have in right you hold,
         	Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend
         	The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up
         	Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
         	With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
         	The rich advantage of good exercise?
         	That the time's enemies may not have this
         	To grace occasions, let it be our suit
         	That you have bid us ask his liberty;
         	Which for our goods we do no further ask
         	Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
         	Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
         
         	[Enter HUBERT]
         
         KING JOHN	Let it be so: I do commit his youth
         	To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?
         
         	[Taking him apart]
         
         PEMBROKE	This is the man should do the bloody deed;
         	He showed his warrant to a friend of mine:
         	The image of a wicked heinous fault
         	Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
         	Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
         	And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,
         	What we so feared he had a charge to do.
         
         SALISBURY	The colour of the king doth come and go
         	Between his purpose and his conscience,
         	 heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:
         	His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.
         
         PEMBROKE	And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
         	The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
         
         KING JOHN	We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
         	Good lords, although my will to give is living,
         	The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
         	He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.
         
         SALISBURY	Indeed we feared his sickness was past cure.
         
         PEMBROKE	Indeed we heard how near his death he was
         	Before the child himself felt he was sick:
         	This must be answered either here or hence.
         
         KING JOHN	Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
         	Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
         	Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
         
         SALISBURY	It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame
         	That greatness should so grossly offer it:
         	So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
         
         PEMBROKE	Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,
         	And find the inheritance of this poor child,
         	His little kingdom of a forced grave.
         	That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,
         	Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
         	This must not be thus borne: this will break out
         	To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.
         
         	[Exeunt Lords]
         
         KING JOHN	They burn in indignation. I repent:
         	There is no sure foundation set on blood,
         	No certain life achieved by others' death.
         
         	[Enter a Messenger]
         
         	A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
         	That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
         	So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
         	Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?
         
         Messenger	From France to England. Never such a power
         	For any foreign preparation
         	Was levied in the body of a land.
         	The copy of your speed is learned by them;
         	For when you should be told they do prepare,
         	The tidings come that they are all arrived.
         
         KING JOHN	O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
         	Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,
         	That such an army could be drawn in France,
         	And she not hear of it?
         
         Messenger	My liege, her ear
         	Is stopped with dust; the first of April died
         	Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,
         	The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
         	Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
         	I idly heard; if true or false I know not.
         
         KING JOHN	Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
         	O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
         	My discontented peers! What! mother dead!
         	How wildly then walks my estate in France!
         	Under whose conduct came those powers of France
         	That thou for truth givest out are landed here?
         
         Messenger	Under the Dauphin.
         
         KING JOHN	                  Thou hast made me giddy
         	With these ill tidings.
         
         	[Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret]
         
         		  Now, what says the world
         	To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
         	My head with more ill news, for it is full.
         
         BASTARD	But if you be afeard to hear the worst,
         	Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.
         
         KING JOHN	Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed
         	Under the tide: but now I breathe again
         	Aloft the flood, and can give audience
         	To any tongue, speak it of what it will.
         
         BASTARD	How I have sped among the clergymen,
         	The sums I have collected shall express.
         	But as I travelled hither through the land,
         	I find the people strangely fantasied;
         	Possessed with rumours, full of idle dreams,
         	Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:
         	And here a prophet, that I brought with me
         	From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
         	With many hundreds treading on his heels;
         	To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,
         	That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
         	Your highness should deliver up your crown.
         
         KING JOHN	Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
         
         PETER	Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
         
         KING JOHN	Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
         	And on that day at noon whereon he says
         	I shall yield up my crown, let him be hanged.
         	Deliver him to safety; and return,
         	For I must use thee.
         
         	[Exeunt HUBERT with PETER]
         
         		O my gentle cousin,
         	Hearest thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
         
         BASTARD	The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:
         	Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
         	With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
         	And others more, going to seek the grave
         	Of Arthur, who they say is killed to-night
         	On your suggestion.
         
         KING JOHN	Gentle kinsman, go,
         	And thrust thyself into their companies:
         	I have a way to win their loves again;
         	Bring them before me.
         
         BASTARD	I will seek them out.
         
         KING JOHN	Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
         	O, let me have no subject enemies,
         	When adverse foreigners affright my towns
         	With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
         	Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
         	And fly  thought from them to me again.
         
         BASTARD	The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING JOHN	Spoke  a sprightful noble gentleman.
         	Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
         	Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
         	And be thou he.
         
         Messenger	                  With all my heart, my liege.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING JOHN	My mother dead!
         
         	[Re-enter HUBERT]
         
         HUBERT	My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
         	Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
         	The other four in wondrous motion.
         
         KING JOHN	Five moons!
         
         HUBERT	Old men and beldams in the streets
         	Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
         	Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:
         	And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
         	And whisper one another in the ear;
         	And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
         	Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
         	With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
         	I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
         	The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
         	With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
         	Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
         	Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
         	Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
         	Told of a many thousand war French
         	That were embattailed and ranked in Kent:
         	Another lean unwashed artificer
         	Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.
         
         KING JOHN	Why seekest thou to possess me with these fears?
         	Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
         	Thy hand hath murdered him: I had a mighty cause
         	To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
         
         HUBERT	No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?
         
         KING JOHN	It is the curse of kings to be attended
         	By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
         	To break within the bloody house of life,
         	And on the winking of authority
         	To understand a law, to know the meaning
         	Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
         	More upon humour than advised respect.
         
         HUBERT	Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
         
         KING JOHN	O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
         	Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
         	Witness against us to damnation!
         	How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
         	Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
         	A fellow by the hand of nature marked,
         	Quoted and signed to do a deed of shame,
         	This murder had not come into my mind:
         	But taking note of thy abhorred aspect,
         	Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
         	Apt, liable to be employed in danger,
         	I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
         	And thou, to be endeared to a king,
         	Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
         
         HUBERT	My lord--
         
         KING JOHN	Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
         	When I spake darkly what I purposed,
         	Or turned an eye of doubt upon my face,
         	As bid me tell my tale in express words,
         	Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
         	And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
         	But thou didst understand me by my signs
         	And didst in signs again parley with sin;
         	Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
         	And consequently thy rude hand to act
         	The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
         	Out of my sight, and never see me more!
         	My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
         	Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
         	Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
         	This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
         	Hostility and civil tumult reigns
         	Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
         
         HUBERT	Arm you against your other enemies,
         	I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
         	Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
         	Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
         	Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
         	Within this bosom never entered yet
         	The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
         	And you have slandered nature in my form,
         	Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
         	Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
         	Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
         
         KING JOHN	Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
         	Throw this report on their incensed rage,
         	And make them tame to their obedience!
         	Forgive the comment that my passion made
         	Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
         	And foul imaginary eyes of blood
         	Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
         	O, answer not, but to my closet bring
         	The angry lords with all expedient haste.
         	I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.

         ARTHUR	The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:
         	Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!
         	There's few or none do know me: if they did,
         	This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.
         	I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.
         	If I get down, and do not break my limbs,
         	I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:
         	As good to die and go, as die and stay.
         
         	[Leaps down]
         
         	O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:
         	Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!

         	[Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT]
         
         SALISBURY	Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:
         	It is our safety, and we must embrace
         	This gentle offer of the perilous time.
         
         PEMBROKE	Who brought that letter from the cardinal?
         
         SALISBURY	The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
         	Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
         	Is much more general than these lines import.
         
         BIGOT	To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
         
         SALISBURY	Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
         	Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.
         
         	[Enter the BASTARD]
         
         BASTARD	Once more to-day well met, distempered lords!
         	The king by me requests your presence straight.
         
         SALISBURY	The king hath dispossessed himself of us:
         	We will not line his thin bestained cloak
         	With our pure honours, nor attend the foot
         	That leaves the print of blood wherever it walks.
         	Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
         
         BASTARD	Whatever you think, good words, I think, were best.
         
         SALISBURY	Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
         
         BASTARD	But there is little reason in your grief;
         	Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
         
         PEMBROKE	Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
         
         BASTARD	'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.
         
         SALISBURY	This is the prison. What is he lies here?
         
         	[Seeing ARTHUR]
         
         PEMBROKE	O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
         	The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
         
         SALISBURY	Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
         	Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
         
         BIGOT	Or, when he doomed this beauty to a grave,
         	Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
         
         SALISBURY	Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
         	Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
         	Or do you almost think, although you see,
         	That you do see? could thought, without this object,
         	Form such another? This is the very top,
         	The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
         	Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,
         	The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
         	That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
         	Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
         
         PEMBROKE	All murders past do stand excused in this:
         	And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
         	Shall give a holiness, a purity,
         	To the yet unbegotten sin of times;
         	And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
         	Exampled by this heinous spectacle.
         
         BASTARD	It is a damned and a bloody work;
         	The graceless action of a heavy hand,
         	If that it be the work of any hand.
         
         SALISBURY	If that it be the work of any hand!
         	We had a kind of light what would ensue:
         	It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
         	The practise and the purpose of the king:
         	From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
         	Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
         	And breathing to his breathless excellence
         	The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
         	Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
         	Never to be infected with delight,
         	Nor conversant with ease and idleness,
         	Till I have set a glory to this hand,
         	By giving it the worship of revenge.

         BIGOT	Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?
         
         HUBERT	Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
         	My innocent life against an emperor.
         
         SALISBURY	Thou art a murderer.
         
         HUBERT	Do not prove me so;
         	Yet I am none: whose tongue soever speaks false,
         	Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.

         	Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
         	I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;
         	Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,
         	That you shall think the devil is come from hell.
         
         BIGOT	What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
         	Second a villain and a murderer?
         
         HUBERT	Lord Bigot, I am none.
         
         BIGOT	Who killed this prince?
         
         HUBERT	'Tis not an hour since I left him well:
         	I honoured him, I loved him, and will weep
         	My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
         
         SALISBURY	Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
         	For villany is not without such rheum;
         	And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
         	 rivers of remorse and innocency.
         	Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
         	The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;
         	For I am stifled with this smell of sin.
         
         BIGOT	Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
         
         PEMBROKE	There tell the king he may inquire us out.

         BASTARD	Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
         	Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
         	Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
         	Art thou damned, Hubert.
         
         HUBERT	Do but hear me, sir.
         
         BASTARD	Ha! I'll tell thee what;
         	Thou'rt damned as black--nay, nothing is so black;
         	Thou art more deep damned than Prince Lucifer:
         	There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
         	As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.
         
         HUBERT	Upon my soul--
         
         BASTARD	                  If thou didst but consent
         	To this most cruel act, do but despair;
         	And if thou wantest a cord, the smallest thread
         	That ever spider twisted from her womb
         	Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam
         	To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
         	Put but a little water in a spoon,
         	And it shall be as all the ocean,
         	Enough to stifle such a villain up.
         	I do suspect thee very grievously.
         
         HUBERT	If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
         	Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
         	Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
         	Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
         	I left him well.
         
         BASTARD	                  Go, bear him in thine arms.
         	I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way
         	Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
         	How easy dost thou take all England up!
         	From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
         	The life, the right and truth of all this realm
         	Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
         	To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
         	The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
         	Now for the bare-picked bone of majesty
         	Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
         	And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:
         	Now powers from home and discontents at home
         	Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
         	As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
         	The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
         	Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
         	Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
         	And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:
         	A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
         	And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.

         	The circle of my glory.
         
         	[Giving the crown]
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	Take again
         	From this my hand, as holding of the pope
         	Your sovereign greatness and authority.
         
         KING JOHN	Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
         	And from his holiness use all your power
         	To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.
         	Our discontented counties do revolt;
         	Our people quarrel with obedience,
         	Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
         	To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
         	This inundation of mistempered humour
         	Rests by you only to be qualified:
         	Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
         	That present medicine must be ministered,
         	Or overthrow incurable ensues.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
         	Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
         	But since you are a gentle convertite,
         	My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
         	And make fair weather in your blustering land.
         	On this Ascension-day, remember well,
         	Upon your oath of service to the pope,
         	Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING JOHN	Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
         	Say that before Ascension-day at noon
         	My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
         	I did suppose it should be on constraint:
         	But, heaven be thanked, it is but voluntary.
         
         	[Enter the BASTARD]
         
         BASTARD	All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out

         	Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
         	To offer service to your enemy,
         	And wild amazement hurries up and down
         	The little number of your doubtful friends.
         
         KING JOHN	Would not my lords return to me again,
         	After they heard young Arthur was alive?
         
         BASTARD	They found him dead and cast into the streets,
         	An empty casket, where the jewel of life
         	By some damned hand was robbed and ta'en away.
         
         KING JOHN	That villain Hubert told me he did live.
         
         BASTARD	So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
         	But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
         	Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
         	Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
         	Govern the motion of a kingly eye:
         	Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
         	Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
         	Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,
         	That borrow their behaviors from the great,
         	Grow great by your example and put on
         	The dauntless spirit of resolution.
         	Away, and glister  the god of war,
         	When he intendeth to become the field:
         	Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
         	What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
         	And fright him there? and make him tremble there?
         	O, let it not be said: forage, and run
         	To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
         	And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.
         
         KING JOHN	The legate of the pope hath been with me,
         	And I have made a happy peace with him;
         	And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
         	Led by the Dauphin.
         
         BASTARD	O inglorious league!
         	Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
         	Send fair-play orders and make compromise,
         	Insinuation, parley and base truce
         	To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,
         	A cockered silken wanton, brave our fields,
         	And flesh his spirit in a war soil,
         	Mocking the air with colours idly spread,
         	And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:
         	Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;
         	Or if he do, let it at least be said
         	They saw we had a purpose of defence.
         
         KING JOHN	Have thou the ordering of this present time.

         	[Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE,
         	BIGOT, and Soldiers]
         
         LEWIS	My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,
         	And keep it safe for our remembrance:
         	Return the precedent to these lords again;
         	That, having our fair order written down,
         	Both they and we, perusing over these notes,
         	May know wherefore we took the sacrament
         	And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
         
         SALISBURY	Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
         	And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
         	A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
         	To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,
         	I am not glad that such a sore of time
         	Should seek a plaster by contemned revolt,
         	And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
         	By making many. O, it grieves my soul,
         	That I must draw this metal from my side
         	To be a widow-maker! O, and there
         	Where honourable rescue and defence
         	Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
         	But such is the infection of the time,
         	That, for the health and physic of our right,
         	We cannot deal but with the very hand
         	Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
         	And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,
         	That we, the sons and children of this isle,
         	Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
         	Wherein we step after a stranger march
         	Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
         	Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep
         	Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--
         	To grace the gentry of a land remote,
         	And follow unacquainted colours here?
         	What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
         	That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
         	Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,
         	And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;
         	Where these two Christian armies might combine
         	The blood of malice in a vein of league,
         	And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
         
         LEWIS	A noble temper dost thou show in this;
         	And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
         	Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
         	O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
         	Between compulsion and a brave respect!
         	Let me wipe off this honourable dew,
         	That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:
         	My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
         	Being an ordinary inundation;
         	But this effusion of such manly drops,
         	This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,
         	Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed
         	Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
         	Figured quite over with burning meteors.
         	Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
         	And with a great heart heave away the storm:
         	Commend these waters to those baby eyes
         	That never saw the giant world enraged;
         	Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
         	Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
         	Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
         	Into the purse of rich prosperity
         	As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,
         	That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
         	And even there, methinks, an angel spake:
         
         	[Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH]
         
         	Look, where the holy legate comes apace,
         	To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
         	And on our actions set the name of right
         	With holy breath.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	                  Hail, noble prince of France!
         	The next is this, King John hath reconciled
         	Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,
         	That so stood out against the holy church,
         	The great metropolis and see of Rome:
         	Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;
         	And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
         	That  a lion fostered up at hand,
         	It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
         	And be no further harmful than in show.
         
         LEWIS	Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
         	I am too high-born to be propertied,
         	To be a secondary at control,
         	Or useful serving-man and instrument,
         	To any sovereign state throughout the world.
         	Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
         	Between this chastised kingdom and myself,
         	And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
         	And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
         	With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
         	You taught me how to know the face of right,
         	Acquainted me with interest to this land,
         	Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;
         	And come ye now to tell me John hath made
         	His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
         	I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,
         	After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
         	And, now it is half-conquered, must I back
         	Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
         	Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
         	What men provided, what munition sent,
         	To underprop this action? Is't not I
         	That undergo this charge? who else but I,
         	And such as to my claim are liable,
         	Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
         	Have I not heard these islanders shout out
         	'Vive le roi!' as I have banked their towns?
         	Have I not here the best cards for the game,
         	To win this easy match played for a crown?
         	And shall I now give over the yielded set?
         	No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	You look but on the outside of this work.
         
         LEWIS	Outside or inside, I will not return
         	Till my attempt so much be glorified
         	As to my ample hope was promised
         	Before I drew this gallant head of war,
         	And culled these fiery spirits from the world,
         	To outlook conquest and to win renown
         	Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
         
         	[Trumpet sounds]

         	[Enter the BASTARD, attended]
         
         BASTARD	According to the fair play of the world,
         	Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:
         	My holy lord of Milan, from the king
         	I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;
         	And, as you answer, I do know the scope
         	And warrant limited unto my tongue.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
         	And will not temporize with my entreaties;
         	He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.
         
         BASTARD	By all the blood that ever fury breathed,
         	The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
         	For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
         	He is prepared, and reason too he should:
         	This apish and unmannerly approach,
         	This harnessed masque and unadvised revel,
         	This unhaired sauciness and boyish troops,
         	The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
         	To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
         	From out the circle of his territories.
         	That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
         	To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
         	To dive  buckets in concealed wells,
         	To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
         	To lie  pawns locked up in chests and trunks,
         	To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
         	In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
         	Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
         	Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;
         	Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,
         	That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
         	No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
         	And  an eagle over his aery towers,
         	To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
         	And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
         	You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
         	Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
         	For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
         	 Amazons come tripping after drums,
         	Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
         	Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
         	To fierce and bloody inclination.
         
         LEWIS	There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
         	We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;
         	We hold our time too precious to be spent
         	With such a brabbler.
         
         CARDINAL PANDULPH	Give me leave to speak.
         
         BASTARD	No, I will speak.
         
         LEWIS	                  We will attend to neither.
         	Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
         	Plead for our interest and our being here.
         
         BASTARD	Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
         	And so shall you, being beaten: do but start
         	An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
         	And even at hand a drum is ready braced
         	That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
         	Sound but another, and another shall
         	As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
         	And mock the deep-mouthed thunder: for at hand,
         	Not trusting to this halting legate here,
         	Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
         	Is war John; and in his forehead sits
         	A bare-ribbed death, whose office is this day
         	To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
         
         LEWIS	Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.

         KING JOHN	How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.
         
         HUBERT	Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?
         
         KING JOHN	This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
         	Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
         
         	[Enter a Messenger]
         
         Messenger	My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
         	Desires your majesty to leave the field
         	And send him word by me which way you go.
         
         KING JOHN	Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
         
         Messenger	Be of good comfort; for the great supply
         	That was expected by the Dauphin here,
         	Are wrecked three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.
         	This news was brought to Richard but even now:
         	The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.
         
         KING JOHN	Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,
         	And will not let me welcome this good news.
         	Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;
         	Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.

         	[Enter SALISBURY, PEMBROKE, and BIGOT]
         
         SALISBURY	I did not think the king so stored with friends.
         
         PEMBROKE	Up once again; put spirit in the French:
         	If they miscarry, we miscarry too.
         
         SALISBURY	That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
         	In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
         
         PEMBROKE	They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
         
         	[Enter MELUN, wounded]
         
         MELUN	Lead me to the revolts of England here.
         
         SALISBURY	When we were happy we had other names.
         
         PEMBROKE	It is the Count Melun.
         
         SALISBURY	Wounded to death.
         
         MELUN	Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
         	Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
         	And welcome home again discarded faith.
         	Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
         	For if the French be lords of this loud day,
         	He means to recompense the pains you take
         	By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn
         	And I with him, and many moe with me,
         	Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;
         	Even on that altar where we swore to you
         	Dear amity and everlasting love.
         
         SALISBURY	May this be possible? may this be true?
         
         MELUN	Have I not hideous death within my view,
         	Retaining but a quantity of life,
         	Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax
         	Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
         	What in the world should make me now deceive,
         	Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
         	Why should I then be false, since it is true
         	That I must die here and live hence by truth?
         	I say again, if Lewis do win the day,
         	He is forsworn, if ever those eyes of yours
         	Behold another day break in the east:
         	But even this night, whose black contagious breath
         	Already smokes about the burning crest
         	Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,
         	Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
         	Paying the fine of rated treachery
         	Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
         	If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
         	Commend me to one Hubert with your king:
         	The love of him, and this respect besides,
         	For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
         	Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
         	In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
         	From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
         	Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
         	In peace, and part this body and my soul
         	With contemplation and devout desires.
         
         SALISBURY	We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
         	But I do love the favour and the form
         	Of this most fair occasion, by the which
         	We will untread the steps of damned flight,
         	And  a bated and retired flood,
         	Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
         	Stoop low within those bounds we have overlooked
         	And cabby run on in obedience
         	Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
         	My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
         	For I do see the cruel pangs of death
         	Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
         	And happy newness, that intends old right.

         LEWIS	The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,
         	But stayed and made the western welkin blush,
         	When English measure backward their own ground
         	In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
         	When with a volley of our needless shot,
         	After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
         	And wound our tattering colours clearly up,
         	Last in the field, and almost lords of it!

         Messenger	The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
         	By his persuasion are again fall'n off,
         	And your supply, which you have wished so long,
         	Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.
         
         LEWIS	Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
         	I did not think to be so sad to-night
         	As this hath made me. Who was he that said
         	King John did fly an hour or two before
         	The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
         
         Messenger	Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
         
         LEWIS	Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:
         	The day shall not be up so soon as I,

         HUBERT	Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
         
         BASTARD	A friend. What art thou?
         
         HUBERT	Of the part of England.
         
         BASTARD	Whither dost thou go?
         
         HUBERT	What's that to thee? why may not I demand
         	Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?
         
         BASTARD	Hubert, I think?
         
         HUBERT	                  Thou hast a perfect thought:
         	I will upon all hazards well believe
         	Thou art my friend, that knowest my tongue so well.
         	Who art thou?
         
         BASTARD	                  Who thou wilt: and if thou please,
         	Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
         	I come one way of the Plantagenets.
         
         HUBERT	Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
         	Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,
         	That any accent breaking from thy tongue
         	Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
         
         BASTARD	Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
         
         HUBERT	Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,
         	To find you out.
         
         BASTARD	                  Brief, then; and what's the news?
         
         HUBERT	O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
         	Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.
         
         BASTARD	Show me the very wound of this ill news:
         	I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.
         
         HUBERT	The king, I fear, is poisoned by a monk:
         	I left him almost speechless; and broke out
         	To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
         	The better arm you to the sudden time,
         	Than if you had at leisure known of this.
         
         BASTARD	How did he take it? who did taste to him?
         
         HUBERT	A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
         	Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king
         	Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.
         
         BASTARD	Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
         
         HUBERT	Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
         	And brought Prince Henry in their company;
         	At whose request the king hath pardoned them,
         	And they are all about his majesty.
         
         BASTARD	Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
         	And tempt us not to bear above our power!
         	I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,
         	Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;
         	These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
         	Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.

         	[Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT]
         
         PRINCE HENRY	It is too late: the life of all his blood
         	Is touched corruptibly, and his pure brain,
         	Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
         	Doth by the idle comments that it makes
         	Foretell the ending of mortality.
         
         	[Enter PEMBROKE]
         
         PEMBROKE	His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
         	That, being brought into the open air,
         	It would allay the burning quality
         	Of that fell poison which assaileth him.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Let him be brought into the orchard here.
         	Doth he still rage?
         
         	[Exit BIGOT]
         
         PEMBROKE	He is more patient
         	Than when you left him; even now he sung.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
         	In their continuance will not feel themselves.
         	Death, having preyed upon the outward parts,
         	Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
         	Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
         	With many legions of strange fantasies,
         	Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
         	Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death
         	should sing.
         	I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
         	Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
         	And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
         	His soul and body to their lasting rest.
         
         SALISBURY	Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born
         	To set a form upon that indigest
         	Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
         
         	[Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair]
         
         KING JOHN	Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
         	It would not out at windows nor at doors.
         	There is so hot a summer in my bosom,
         	That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
         	I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
         	Upon a parchment, and against this fire
         	Do I shrink up.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	                  How fares your majesty?
         
         KING JOHN	Poisoned,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:
         	And none of you will bid the winter come
         	To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
         	Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
         	Through my burned bosom, nor entreat the north
         	To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
         	And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,
         	I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait
         	And so ingrateful, you deny me that.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	O that there were some virtue in my tears,
         	That might relieve you!
         
         KING JOHN	The salt in them is hot.
         	Within me is a hell; and there the poison
         	Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
         	On unreprievable condemned blood.
         
         	[Enter the BASTARD]
         
         BASTARD	O, I am scalded with my violent motion,
         	And spleen of speed to see your majesty!
         
         KING JOHN	O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:
         	The tackle of my heart is cracked and burned,
         	And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
         	Are turned to one thread, one little hair:
         	My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
         	Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
         	And then all this thou seest is but a clod
         	And module of confounded royalty.
         
         BASTARD	The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
         	Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;
         	For in a night the best part of my power,
         	As I upon advantage did remove,
         	Were in the Washes all unwarily
         	Devoured by the unexpected flood.
         
         	[KING JOHN dies]
         
         SALISBURY	You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
         	My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
         	What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
         	When this was now a king, and now is clay?
         
         BASTARD	Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
         	To do the office for thee of revenge,
         	And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
         	As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
         	Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
         	Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,
         	And instantly return with me again,
         	To push destruction and perpetual shame
         	Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
         	Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
         	The Dauphin rages at our very heels.
         
         SALISBURY	It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
         	The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
         	Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,
         	And brings from him such offers of our peace
         	As we with honour and respect may take,
         	With purpose presently to leave this war.
         
         BASTARD	He will the rather do it when he sees
         	Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
         
         SALISBURY	Nay, it is in a manner done already;
         	For many carriages he hath dispatched
         	To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
         	To the disposing of the cardinal:
         	With whom yourself, myself and other lords,
         	If you think meet, this afternoon will post
         	To consummate this business happily.
         
         BASTARD	Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,
         	With other princes that may best be spared,
         	Shall wait upon your father's funeral.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	At Worcester must his body be interred;
         	For so he willed it.
         
         BASTARD	Thither shall it then:
         	And happily may your sweet self put on
         	The lineal state and glory of the land!
         	To whom with all submission, on my knee
         	I do bequeath my faithful services
         	And true subjection everlastingly.
         
         SALISBURY	And the  tender of our love we make,
         	To rest without a spot for evermore.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
         	And knows not how to do it but with tears.
         
         BASTARD	O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
         	Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
         	This England never did, nor never shall,
         	Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
         	But when it first did help to wound itself.
         	Now these her princes are come home again,
         	Come the three corners of the world in arms,
         	And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
         	If England to itself do rest but true.

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	London. The palace.
         
         
         	[Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL
         	of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others]
         
         KING HENRY 	So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
         	Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
         	And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
         	To be commenced in strands afar remote.
         	No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
         	Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
         	Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
         	Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
         	Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
         	Which,  the meteors of a troubled heaven,
         	All of one nature, of one substance bred,
         	Did lately meet in the intestine shock
         	And furious close of civil butchery
         	Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
         	March all one way and be no more opposed
         	Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
         	The edge of war,  an ill-sheathed knife,
         	No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
         	As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
         	Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
         	We are impressed and engaged to fight,
         	Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
         	Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
         	To chase these pagans in those holy fields
         	Over whose acres walked those blessed feet
         	Which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed
         	For our advantage on the bitter cross.
         	But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
         	And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
         	Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
         	Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
         	What yesternight our council did decree
         	In forwarding this dear expedience.
         
         WESTMORELAND	My liege, this haste was hot in question,
         	And many limits of the charge set down
         	But yesternight: when all athwart there came
         	A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
         	Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
         	Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
         	Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
         	Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
         	A thousand of his people butchered;
         	Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
         	Such beastly shameless transformation,
         	By those Welshwomen done as may not be
         	Without much shame retold or spoken of.
         
         KING HENRY 	It seems then that the tidings of this broil
         	Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
         
         WESTMORELAND	This matched with other did, my gracious lord;
         	For more uneven and unwelcome news
         	Came from the north and thus it did import:
         	On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
         	Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
         	That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
         	At Holmedon met,
         	Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
         	As by discharge of their artillery,
         	And shape of lihood, the news was told;
         	For he that brought them, in the very heat
         	And pride of their contention did take horse,
         	Uncertain of the issue any way.
         
         KING HENRY 	Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
         	Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
         	Stained with the variation of each soil
         	Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
         	And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
         	The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
         	Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
         	Balked in their own blood did Sir Walter see
         	On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
         	Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
         	To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
         	Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
         	And is not this an honourable spoil?
         	A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
         
         WESTMORELAND	In faith,
         	It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
         
         KING HENRY 	Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
         	In envy that my Lord Northumberland
         	Should be the father to so blest a son,
         	A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
         	Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
         	Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
         	Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
         	See riot and dishonour stain the brow
         	Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
         	That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
         	In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
         	And called mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
         	Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
         	But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
         	Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
         	Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
         	To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
         	I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
         
         WESTMORELAND	This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
         	Malevolent to you in all aspects;
         	Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
         	The crest of youth against your dignity.
         
         KING HENRY 	But I have sent for him to answer this;
         	And for this cause awhile we must neglect
         	Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
         	Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
         	Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
         	But come yourself with speed to us again;
         	For more is to be said and to be done
         	Than out of anger can be uttered.
         
         WESTMORELAND	I will, my liege.

         	[Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF]
         
         FALSTAFF	Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
         	and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
         	benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
         	demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
         	What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
         	day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
         	capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
         	signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
         	a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
         	reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
         	the time of the day.
         
         FALSTAFF	Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
         	purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
         	by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
         	I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
         	save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
         	thou wilt have none,--
         
         PRINCE HENRY	What, none?
         
         FALSTAFF	No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
         	prologue to an egg and butter.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
         
         FALSTAFF	Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
         	us that are squires of the night's body be called
         	thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
         	foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
         	moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
         	being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
         	chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
         	fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
         	flow  the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
         	by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
         	most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
         	dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
         	swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
         	now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
         	and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
         
         FALSTAFF	By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
         	hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
         	is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
         
         FALSTAFF	How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
         	thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
         	buff jerkin?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
         
         FALSTAFF	Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
         	time and oft.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
         
         FALSTAFF	No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
         	and where it would not, I have used my credit.
         
         FALSTAFF	Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
         	that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
         	wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
         	thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
         	with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
         	not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	No; thou shalt.
         
         FALSTAFF	Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
         	the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
         
         FALSTAFF	Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
         	humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
         	you.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	For obtaining of suits?
         
         FALSTAFF	Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
         	hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
         	as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
         
         FALSTAFF	Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
         	Moor-ditch?
         
         FALSTAFF	Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
         	the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
         	prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
         	with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
         	commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
         	lord of the council rated me the other day in the
         	street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
         	he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
         	yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
         	streets, and no man regards it.
         
         FALSTAFF	O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
         	to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
         	me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
         	thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
         	should speak truly, little better than one of the
         	wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
         	it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
         	I'll be damned for never a king's son in
         	Christendom.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
         
         FALSTAFF	'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
         	do not, call me villain and baffle me.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
         	to purse-taking.
         
         FALSTAFF	Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
         	man to labour in his vocation.
         
         	[Enter POINS]
         
         	Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
         	match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
         	hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
         	most omnipotent villain that ever cried estand' to
         	a true man.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Good morrow, Ned.
         
         POINS	Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
         	what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
         	agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
         	soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
         	and a cold capon's leg?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
         	his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
         	proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
         
         POINS	Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
         
         POINS	But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
         	o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
         	to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
         	riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
         	for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
         	Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
         	supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
         	as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
         	your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
         	at home and be hanged.
         
         FALSTAFF	Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
         	I'll hang you for going.
         
         POINS	You will, chops?
         
         FALSTAFF	Hal, wilt thou make one?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
         
         FALSTAFF	There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
         	fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
         	royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
         
         FALSTAFF	Why, that's well said.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
         
         FALSTAFF	By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I care not.
         
         POINS	Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
         	I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
         	that he shall go.
         
         FALSTAFF	Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
         	the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
         	move and what he hears may be believed, that the
         	true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
         	thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
         	countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
         
         	[Exit Falstaff]
         
         POINS	Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
         	to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
         	manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
         	shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
         	yourself and I will not be there; and when they
         	have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
         	this head off from my shoulders.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	How shall we part with them in setting forth?
         
         POINS	Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
         	appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
         	our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
         	upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
         	no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Yea, but 'tis  that they will know us by our
         	horses, by our habits and by every other
         	appointment, to be ourselves.
         
         POINS	Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
         	in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
         	leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
         	for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
         
         POINS	Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
         	true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
         	third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
         	forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
         	incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
         	tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
         	least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
         	extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
         	lies the jest.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
         	necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
         	there I'll sup. Farewell.
         
         POINS	Farewell, my lord.
         
         	[Exit Poins]
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I know you all, and will awhile uphold
         	The unyoked humour of your idleness:
         	Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
         	Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
         	To smother up his beauty from the world,
         	That, when he please again to be himself,
         	Being wanted, he may be more wondered at,
         	By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
         	Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
         	If all the year were playing holidays,
         	To sport would be as tedious as to work;
         	But when they seldom come, they wished for come,
         	And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
         	So, when this loose behavior I throw off
         	And pay the debt I never promised,
         	By how much better than my word I am,
         	By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
         	And  bright metal on a sullen ground,
         	My reformation, glittering over my fault,
         	Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
         	Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
         	I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
         	Redeeming time when men think least I will.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         
         
         
         	1 KING HENRY 
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	London. The palace.
         
         
         	[Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR,
         	SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others]
         
         KING HENRY 	My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
         	Unapt to stir at these indignities,
         	And you have found me; for accordingly
         	You tread upon my patience: but be sure
         	I will from henceforth rather be myself,
         	Mighty and to be feared, than my condition;
         	Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
         	And therefore lost that title of respect
         	Which the proud soul never pays but to the proud.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
         	The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
         	And that same greatness too which our own hands
         	Have holp to make so portly.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord.--
         
         KING HENRY 	Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
         	Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
         	O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
         	And majesty might never yet endure
         	The moody frontier of a servant brow.
         	You have good leave to leave us: when we need
         	Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
         
         	[Exit Worcester]
         
         	You were about to speak.
         
         	[To North]
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Yea, my good lord.
         	Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
         	Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
         	Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
         	As is delivered to your majesty:
         	Either envy, therefore, or misprison
         	Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
         
         HOTSPUR	My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
         	But I remember, when the fight was done,
         	When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
         	Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
         	Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dressed,
         	Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reaped
         	Showed  a stubble-land at harvest-home;
         	He was perfumed  a milliner;
         	And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
         	A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
         	He gave his nose and took't away again;
         	Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
         	Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talked,
         	And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
         	He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
         	To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
         	Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
         	With many holiday and lady terms
         	He questioned me; amongst the rest, demanded
         	My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
         	I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
         	To be so pestered with a popinjay,
         	Out of my grief and my impatience,
         	Answered neglectingly I know not what,
         	He should or he should not; for he made me mad
         	To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
         	And talk so  a waiting-gentlewoman
         	Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
         	And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth
         	Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
         	And that it was great pity, so it was,
         	This villanous salt-petre should be digged
         	Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
         	Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed
         	So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
         	He would himself have been a soldier.
         	This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
         	I answered indirectly, as I said;
         	And I beseech you, let not his report
         	Come current for an accusation
         	Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
         
         SIR WALTER BLUNT	The circumstance considered, good my lord,
         	Whatever Lord Harry Percy then had said
         	To such a person and in such a place,
         	At such a time, with all the rest retold,
         	May reasonably die and never rise
         	To do him wrong or any way impeach
         	What then he said, so he unsay it now.
         
         KING HENRY 	Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
         	But with proviso and exception,
         	That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
         	His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
         	Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betrayed
         	The lives of those that he did lead to fight
         	Against that great magician, damned Glendower,
         	Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
         	Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
         	Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
         	Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
         	When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
         	No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
         	For I shall never hold that man my friend
         	Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
         	To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
         
         HOTSPUR	Revolted Mortimer!
         	He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
         	But by the chance of war; to prove that true
         	Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
         	Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
         	When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
         	In single opposition, hand to hand,
         	He did confound the best part of an hour
         	In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
         	Three times they breathed and three times did
         	they drink,
         	Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
         	Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
         	Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
         	And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
         	Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
         	Never did base and rotten policy
         	Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
         	Nor could the noble Mortimer
         	Receive so many, and all willingly:
         	Then let not him be slandered with revolt.
         
         KING HENRY 	Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
         	He never did encounter with Glendower:
         	I tell thee,
         	He durst as well have met the devil alone
         	As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
         	Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
         	Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
         	Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
         	Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
         	As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
         	We licence your departure with your son.
         	Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
         
         	[Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train]
         
         HOTSPUR	An if the devil come and roar for them,
         	I will not send them: I will after straight
         	And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
         	Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
         	Here comes your uncle.
         
         	[Re-enter WORCESTER]
         
         HOTSPUR	Speak of Mortimer!
         	'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
         	Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
         	Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
         	And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
         	But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
         	As high in the air as this unthankful king,
         	As this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
         
         HOTSPUR	He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
         	And when I urged the ransom once again
         	Of my wife's brother, then his cheek looked pale,
         	And on my face he turned an eye of death,
         	Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	I cannot blame him: was not he proclaimed
         	By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	He was; I heard the proclamation:
         	And then it was when the unhappy king,
         	--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
         	Upon his Irish expedition;
         	From whence he intercepted did return
         	To be deposed and shortly murdered.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
         	Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
         
         HOTSPUR	But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then
         	Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
         	Heir to the crown?
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	He did; myself did hear it.
         
         HOTSPUR	Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
         	That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
         	But shall it be that you, that set the crown
         	Upon the head of this forgetful man
         	And for his sake wear the detested blot
         	Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
         	That you a world of curses undergo,
         	Being the agents, or base second means,
         	The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
         	O, pardon me that I descend so low,
         	To show the line and the predicament
         	Wherein you range under this subtle king;
         	Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
         	Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
         	That men of your nobility and power
         	Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
         	As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
         	To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
         	An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
         	And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
         	That you are fooled, discarded and shook off
         	By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
         	No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
         	Your banished honours and restore yourselves
         	Into the good thoughts of the world again,
         	Revenge the jeering and disdained contempt
         	Of this proud king, who studies day and night
         	To answer all the debt he owes to you
         	Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
         	Therefore, I say--
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	                  Peace, cousin, say no more:
         	And now I will unclasp a secret book,
         	And to your quick-conceiving discontents
         	I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
         	As full of peril and adventurous spirit
         	As to over-walk a current roaring loud
         	On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
         
         HOTSPUR	If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
         	Send danger from the east unto the west,
         	So honour cross it from the north to south,
         	And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
         	To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Imagination of some great exploit
         	Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
         
         HOTSPUR	By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
         	To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
         	Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
         	Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
         	And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;
         	So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
         	Without corrival, all her dignities:
         	But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	He apprehends a world of figures here,
         	But not the form of what he should attend.
         	Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
         
         HOTSPUR	I cry you mercy.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	                  Those same noble Scots
         	That are your prisoners,--
         
         HOTSPUR	I'll keep them all;
         	By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
         	No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:
         	I'll keep them, by this hand.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	You start away
         	And lend no ear unto my purposes.
         	Those prisoners you shall keep.
         
         HOTSPUR	Nay, I will; that's flat:
         	He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
         	Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
         	But I will find him when he lies asleep,
         	And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
         	Nay,
         	I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
         	Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
         	To keep his anger still in motion.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Hear you, cousin; a word.
         
         HOTSPUR	All studies here I solemnly defy,
         	Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
         	And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
         	But that I think his father loves him not
         	And would be glad he met with some mischance,
         	I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
         	When you are better tempered to attend.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
         	Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
         	Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
         
         HOTSPUR	Why, look you, I am whipped and scourged with rods,
         	Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
         	Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
         	In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--
         	A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;
         	'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
         	His uncle York; where I first bowed my knee
         	Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--
         	'Sblood!--
         	When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	At Berkley castle.
         
         HOTSPUR	You say true:
         	Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
         	This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
         	Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
         	And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
         	O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!
         	Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Nay, if you have not, to it again;
         	We will stay your leisure.
         
         HOTSPUR	I have done, i' faith.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
         	Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
         	And make the Douglas' son your only mean
         	For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
         	Which I shall send you written, be assured,
         	Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
         
         	[To Northumberland]
         
         	Your son in Scotland being thus employed,
         	Shall secretly into the bosom creep
         	Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
         	The archbishop.
         
         HOTSPUR	Of York, is it not?
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	True; who bears hard
         	His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
         	I speak not this in estimation,
         	As what I think might be, but what I know
         	Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
         	And only stays but to behold the face
         	Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
         
         HOTSPUR	I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Before the game is afoot, thou still letest slip.
         
         HOTSPUR	Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;
         	And then the power of Scotland and of York,
         	To join with Mortimer, ha?
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	And so they shall.
         
         HOTSPUR	In faith, it is exceedingly well aimed.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
         	To save our heads by raising of a head;
         	For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
         	The king will always think him in our debt,
         	And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
         	Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
         	And see already how he doth begin
         	To make us strangers to his looks of love.
         
         HOTSPUR	He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
         	Than I by letters shall direct your course.
         	When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
         	I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
         	Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
         	As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
         	To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
         	Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.

         Ostler	[Within]   Anon, anon.
         
         First Carrier	I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks
         	in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out
         	of all cess.
         
         	[Enter another Carrier]
         
         Second Carrier	Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that
         	is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
         	house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
         
         First Carrier	Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats
         	rose; it was the death of him.
         
         Second Carrier	I think this be the most villanous house in all
         	London road for fleas: I am stung  a tench.
         
         First Carrier	 a tench! by the mass, there is never a king
         	christen could be better bit than I have been since
         	the first cock.
         
         Second Carrier	Why, they will allow us never a jordan, and then we
         	leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds
         	fleas  a loach.
         
         First Carrier	What, ostler! come away and be hanged!
         
         Second Carrier	I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,
         	to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
         
         First Carrier	God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
         	starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
         	never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
         	'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate
         	on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!

         GADSHILL	Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?
         
         First Carrier	I think it be two o'clock.
         
         GADSHILL	I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding
         	in the stable.
         
         First Carrier	Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.
         
         GADSHILL	I pray thee, lend me thine.
         
         Second Carrier	Ay, when? canest tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
         	he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.
         
         GADSHILL	Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?
         
         Second Carrier	Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant
         	thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the
         	gentleman: they will along with company, for they
         	have great charge.
         
         	[Exeunt carriers]
         
         GADSHILL	What, ho! chamberlain!
         
         Chamberlain	[Within]  At hand, quoth pick-purse.
         
         GADSHILL	That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the
         	chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking
         	of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;
         	thou layest the plot how.
         
         	[Enter Chamberlain]
         
         Chamberlain	Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that
         	I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
         	wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
         	him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
         	company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one
         	that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.
         	They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;
         	they will away presently.
         
         GADSHILL	Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'
         	clerks, I'll give thee this neck.
         
         Chamberlain	No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the
         	hangman; for I know thou worshippest . Nicholas
         	as truly as a man of falsehood may.
         
         GADSHILL	What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,
         	I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old
         	Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no
         	starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
         	dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
         	content to do the profession some grace; that would,
         	if matters should be looked into, for their own
         	credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no
         	foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,
         	none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;
         	but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and
         	great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will
         	strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
         	drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,
         	I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the
         	commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey
         	on her, for they ride up and down on her and make
         	her their boots.
         
         Chamberlain	What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold
         	out water in foul way?
         
         GADSHILL	She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We
         	steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt
         	of fern-seed, we walk invisible.
         
         Chamberlain	Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to
         	the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.
         
         GADSHILL	Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
         	purchase, as I am a true man.
         
         Chamberlain	Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
         
         GADSHILL	Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the
         	ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,
         	you muddy knave.

         	thou keep!
         
         FALSTAFF	Where's Poins, Hal?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.
         
         FALSTAFF	I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
         	rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
         	not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
         	further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
         	not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
         	'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
         	forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
         	twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the
         	rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
         	medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it
         	could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
         	Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
         	I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere
         	not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
         	leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
         	ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven
         	ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;
         	and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:
         	a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
         
         	[They whistle]
         
         	Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you
         	rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
         	to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
         	of travellers.
         
         FALSTAFF	Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?
         	'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
         	again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
         	What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?
         
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.

         	have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy
         	tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest
         	is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.

         	to the king's exchequer.
         
         FALSTAFF	You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.
         
         GADSHILL	There's enough to make us all.
         
         FALSTAFF	To be hanged.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;
         	Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape
         	from your encounter, then they light on us.
         
         PETO	How many be there of them?
         
         GADSHILL	Some eight or ten.

         PRINCE HENRY	Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:

         	Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord
         	Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?
         	is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all
         	their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the
         	next month? and are they not some of them set
         	forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an
         	infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
         	of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay
         	open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself
         	and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
         	skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!
         	let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
         	forward to-night.
         
         	[Enter LADY PERCY]
         
         	How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.
         
         LADY PERCY	O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
         	For what offence have I this fortnight been
         	A banished woman from my Harry's bed?
         	Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
         	Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?
         	Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
         	And start so often when thou sitest alone?
         	Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
         	And given my treasures and my rights of thee
         	To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
         	In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watched,
         	And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
         	Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
         	Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talked
         	Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
         	Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
         	Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
         	Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,
         	And all the currents of a heady fight.
         	Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
         	And thus hath so bestirred thee in thy sleep,
         	That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
         	 bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
         	And in thy face strange motions have appeared,
         	Such as we see when men restrain their breath
         	On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
         	Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
         	And I must know it, else he loves me not.
         
         HOTSPUR	What, ho!
         
         	[Enter Servant]
         
         	Is Gilliams with the packet gone?
         
         Servant	He is, my lord, an hour ago.
         
         
         HOTSPUR	Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
         
         Servant	One horse, my lord, he brought even now.
         
         HOTSPUR	What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
         
         Servant	It is, my lord.
         
         HOTSPUR	                  That roan shall by my throne.
         	Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!
         	Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.
         
         	[Exit Servant]
         
         LADY PERCY	But hear you, my lord.
         
         HOTSPUR	What sayest thou, my lady?
         
         LADY PERCY	What is it carries you away?
         
         HOTSPUR	Why, my horse, my love, my horse.
         
         LADY PERCY	Out, you mad-headed ape!
         	A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
         	As you are tossed with. In faith,
         	I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.
         	I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
         	About his title, and hath sent for you
         	To line his enterprise: but if you go,--
         
         HOTSPUR	So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.
         
         LADY PERCY	Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
         	Directly unto this question that I ask:
         	In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,
         	An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
         
         HOTSPUR	Away,
         	Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,
         	I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world
         	To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
         	We must have bloody noses and cracked crowns,
         	And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!
         	What sayest thou, Kate? what wouldest thou
         	have with me?
         
         LADY PERCY	Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
         	Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
         	I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
         	Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.
         
         HOTSPUR	Come, wilt thou see me ride?
         	And when I am on horseback, I will swear
         	I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;
         	I must not have you henceforth question me
         	Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:
         	Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,
         	This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.
         	I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
         	Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,
         	But yet a woman: and for secrecy,
         	No lady closer; for I well believe
         	Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;
         	And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.
         
         LADY PERCY	How! so far?
         
         HOTSPUR	Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:
         	Whither I go, thither shall you go too;
         	To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.
         	Will this content you, Kate?
         
         LADY PERCY	It must of force.

         	1 KING HENRY 
         
         
         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The Boar's-Head Tavern, Eastcheap.
         
         
         	[Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me
         	thy hand to laugh a little.
         
         POINS	Where hast been, Hal?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four
         	score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
         	base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother
         	to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by
         	their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.
         	They take it already upon their salvation, that
         	though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king
         	of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
         	 Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a
         	good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I
         	am king of England, I shall command all the good
         	lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing
         	scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they
         	cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I
         	am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
         	that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
         	during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost
         	much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet
         	action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of
         	Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped
         	even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that
         	never spake other English in his life than 'Eight
         	shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with
         	this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint
         	of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to
         	drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,
         	do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my
         	puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
         	thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale
         	to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and
         	I'll show thee a precedent.
         
         POINS	Francis!
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Thou art perfect.
         
         POINS	Francis!
         
         	[Exit POINS]
         
         	[Enter FRANCIS]
         
         FRANCIS	Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Come hither, Francis.
         
         FRANCIS	My lord?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	How long hast thou to serve, Francis?
         
         FRANCIS	Forsooth, five years, and as much as to--
         
         POINS	[Within]  Francis!
         
         FRANCIS	Anon, anon, sir.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking
         	of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant
         	as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
         	a fair pair of heels and run from it?
         
         FRANCIS	O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in
         	England, I could find in my heart.
         
         POINS	[Within]  Francis!
         
         FRANCIS	Anon, sir.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	How old art thou, Francis?
         
         FRANCIS	Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--
         
         POINS	[Within]  Francis!
         
         FRANCIS	Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou
         	gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?
         
         FRANCIS	O Lord, I would it had been two!
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me
         	when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.
         
         POINS	[Within]  Francis!
         
         FRANCIS	Anon, anon.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis;
         	or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when
         	thou wilt. But, Francis!
         
         FRANCIS	My lord?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,
         	not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,
         	smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--
         
         FRANCIS	O Lord, sir, who do you mean?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;
         	for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet
         	will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.
         
         FRANCIS	What, sir?
         
         POINS	[Within]  Francis!
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?
         
         	[Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed,
         	not knowing which way to go]
         
         	[Enter Vintner]
         
         Vintner	What, standest thou still, and hearest such a
         	calling? Look to the guests within.
         
         	[Exit Francis]
         
         	My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are
         	at the door: shall I let them in?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.
         
         	[Exit Vintner]
         	Poins!
         
         	[Re-enter POINS]
         
         POINS	Anon, anon, sir.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at
         	the door: shall we be merry?
         
         POINS	As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what
         	cunning match have you made with this jest of the
         	drawer? come, what's the issue?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
         	humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the
         	pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.
         
         	[Re-enter FRANCIS]
         
         	What's o'clock, Francis?
         
         FRANCIS	Anon, anon, sir.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         PRINCE HENRY	That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
         	parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is
         	upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of
         	a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the
         	Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or
         	seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his
         	hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet
         	life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,
         	'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan
         	horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some
         	fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I
         	prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and
         	that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
         	wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.
         
         	[Enter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO;
         	FRANCIS following with wine]
         
         POINS	Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?
         
         FALSTAFF	A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
         	marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I
         	lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend
         	them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
         	Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?
         
         	[He drinks]
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
         	pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
         	of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.
         
         FALSTAFF	You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
         	nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:
         	yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
         	in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;
         	die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
         	not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a
         	shotten herring. There live not three good men
         	unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and
         	grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.
         	I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any
         	thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?
         
         FALSTAFF	A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy
         	kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
         	subjects afore thee  a flock of wild-geese,
         	I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?
         
         FALSTAFF	Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?
         
         POINS	'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the
         	Lord, I'll stab thee.
         
         FALSTAFF	I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call
         	thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
         	could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
         	enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
         	back: call you that backing of your friends? A
         	plague upon such backing! give me them that will
         	face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I
         	drunk to-day.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
         	drunkest last.
         
         FALSTAFF	All's one for that.
         
         	[He drinks]
         
         	A plague of all cowards, still say I.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	What's the matter?
         
         FALSTAFF	What's the matter! there be four of us here have
         	ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Where is it, Jack? where is it?
         
         FALSTAFF	Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
         	poor four of us.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	What, a hundred, man?
         
         FALSTAFF	I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a
         	dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by
         	miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
         	doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
         	through and through; my sword hacked  a
         	hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since
         	I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
         	cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
         	less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Speak, sirs; how was it?
         
         GADSHILL	We four set upon some dozen--
         
         FALSTAFF	Sixteen at least, my lord.
         
         GADSHILL	And bound them.
         
         PETO	No, no, they were not bound.
         
         FALSTAFF	You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I
         	am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.
         
         GADSHILL	As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--
         
         FALSTAFF	And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	What, fought you with them all?
         
         FALSTAFF	All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought
         	not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
         	there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
         	Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
         
         FALSTAFF	Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
         	of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
         	in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell
         	thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
         	knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
         	point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
         
         PRINCE HENRY	What, four? thou saidst but two even now.
         
         FALSTAFF	Four, Hal; I told thee four.
         
         POINS	Ay, ay, he said four.
         
         FALSTAFF	These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at
         	me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
         	points in my target, thus.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Seven? why, there were but four even now.
         
         FALSTAFF	In buckram?
         
         POINS	Ay, four, in buckram suits.
         
         FALSTAFF	Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.
         
         FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear me, Hal?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
         
         FALSTAFF	Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
         	in buckram that I told thee of--
         
         PRINCE HENRY	So, two more already.
         
         FALSTAFF	Their points being broken,--
         
         POINS	Down fell their hose.
         
         FALSTAFF	Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,
         	came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
         	the eleven I paid.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
         
         FALSTAFF	But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
         	knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
         	at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
         	not see thy hand.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	These lies are  their father that begets them;
         	gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
         	clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
         	whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--
         
         FALSTAFF	What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth
         	the truth?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal
         	green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
         	hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?
         
         POINS	Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
         
         FALSTAFF	What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the
         	strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
         	not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
         	compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
         	blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
         	compulsion, I.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine
         	coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,
         	this huge hill of flesh,--
         
         FALSTAFF	'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
         	neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O
         	for breath to utter what is  thee! you
         	tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
         	standing-tuck,--
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and
         	when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,
         	hear me speak but this.
         
         POINS	Mark, Jack.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and
         	were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain
         	tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
         	four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your
         	prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in
         	the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
         	away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
         	for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard
         	bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
         	as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
         	What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
         	thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
         	apparent shame?
         
         POINS	Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?
         
         FALSTAFF	By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
         	Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
         	heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
         	why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
         	beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
         	prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
         	coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
         	myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
         	lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
         	lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
         	to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
         	Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
         	of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
         	merry? shall we have a play extempore?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.
         
         FALSTAFF	Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!
         
         	[Enter Hostess]
         
         Hostess	O Jesu, my lord the prince!
         
         PRINCE HENRY	How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to
         	me?
         
         Hostess	Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at
         	door would speak with you: he says he comes from
         	your father.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and
         	send him back again to my mother.
         
         FALSTAFF	What manner of man is he?
         
         Hostess	An old man.
         
         FALSTAFF	What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
         	I give him his answer?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Prithee, do, Jack.
         
         FALSTAFF	'Faith, and I'll send him packing.
         
         	[Exit FALSTAFF]
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,
         	Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you
         	ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true
         	prince; no, fie!
         
         BARDOLPH	'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's
         	sword so hacked?
         
         PETO	Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would
         	swear truth out of England but he would make you
         	believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the .
         
         BARDOLPH	Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
         	make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
         	with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
         	did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
         	to hear his monstrous devices.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
         	ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
         	thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
         	sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
         	instinct hadst thou for it?
         
         BARDOLPH	My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold
         	these exhalations?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I do.
         
         BARDOLPH	What think you they portend?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Hot livers and cold purses.
         
         BARDOLPH	Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	No, if rightly taken, halter.
         
         	[Re-enter FALSTAFF]
         
         	Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.
         	How now, my sweet creature of bombast!
         	How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?
         
         FALSTAFF	My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was
         	not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have
         	crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
         	sighing and grief! it blows a man up  a
         	bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
         	Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the
         	court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
         	north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
         	bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
         	devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
         	hook--what a plague call you him?
         
         POINS	O, Glendower.
         
         FALSTAFF	Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,
         	and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
         	Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill
         	perpendicular,--
         
         PRINCE HENRY	He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
         	kills a sparrow flying.
         
         FALSTAFF	You have hit it.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	So did he never the sparrow.
         
         FALSTAFF	Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so
         	for running!
         
         FALSTAFF	O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Yes, Jack, upon instinct.
         
         FALSTAFF	I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
         	and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
         	Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's
         	beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
         	land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Why, then, it is , if there come a hot June and
         	this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
         	as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.
         
         FALSTAFF	By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is  we
         	shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
         	art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
         	heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
         	such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
         	spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
         	not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
         	it?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.
         
         FALSTAFF	Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
         	comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the
         	particulars of my life.
         
         FALSTAFF	Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
         	this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden
         	sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
         	crown for a pitiful bald crown!
         
         FALSTAFF	Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
         	now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
         	make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
         	wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
         	in King Cambyses' vein.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Well, here is my leg.
         
         FALSTAFF	And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.
         
         Hostess	O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!
         
         FALSTAFF	Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.
         
         Hostess	O, the father, how he holds his countenance!
         
         FALSTAFF	For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
         	For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
         
         Hostess	O Jesu, he doth it as  one of these harlotry
         	players as ever I see!
         
         FALSTAFF	Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.
         	Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
         	time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
         	the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
         	it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
         	sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
         	partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
         	but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
         	foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
         	me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
         	why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
         	the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
         	blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
         	the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
         	question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
         	which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
         	many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
         	as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
         	the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
         	speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
         	pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
         	woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
         	have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	What manner of man, an it  your majesty?
         
         FALSTAFF	A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
         	cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
         	carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
         	by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
         	remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
         	should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
         	I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
         	known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
         	peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
         	Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
         	me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
         	thou been this month?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Dost thou speak  a king? Do thou stand for me,
         	and I'll play my father.
         
         FALSTAFF	Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
         	majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
         	the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Well, here I am set.
         
         FALSTAFF	And here I stand: judge, my masters.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Now, Harry, whence come you?
         
         FALSTAFF	My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
         
         FALSTAFF	'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
         	ye for a young prince, i' faith.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth never look
         	on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
         	there is a devil haunts thee in the ness of an
         	old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
         	dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
         	bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
         	of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
         	cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with
         	the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
         	grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
         	years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
         	drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
         	capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
         	wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
         	but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?
         
         FALSTAFF	I would your grace would take me with you: whom
         	means your grace?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	That villanous abominable misleader of youth,
         	Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.
         
         FALSTAFF	My lord, the man I know.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I know thou dost.
         
         FALSTAFF	But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
         	were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
         	more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
         	that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
         	that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
         	God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
         	sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
         	to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
         	are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
         	banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
         	Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
         	valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
         	being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
         	thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
         	company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I do, I will.
         
         	[A knocking heard]
         
         	[Exeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH]
         
         	[Re-enter BARDOLPH, running]
         
         BARDOLPH	O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most
         	monstrous watch is at the door.
         
         FALSTAFF	Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to
         	say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
         
         	[Re-enter the Hostess]
         
         Hostess	O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:
         	what's the matter?
         
         Hostess	The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
         	are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?
         
         FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of
         	gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
         	without seeming so.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	And thou a natural coward, without instinct.
         
         FALSTAFF	I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
         	so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
         	as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
         	I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up
         	above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
         	conscience.
         
         FALSTAFF	Both which I have had: but their date is out, and
         	therefore I'll hide me.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Call in the sheriff.
         
         	[Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO]
         
         	[Enter Sheriff and the Carrier]
         
         	Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?
         
         Sheriff	First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
         	Hath followed certain men unto this house.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	What men?
         
         Sheriff	One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
         	A gross fat man.
         
         Carrier	                  As fat as butter.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	The man, I do assure you, is not here;
         	For I myself at this time have employed him.
         	And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
         	That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
         	Send him to answer thee, or any man,
         	For any thing he shall be charged withal:
         	And so let me entreat you leave the house.
         
         Sheriff	I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
         	Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	It may be so: if he have robbed these men,
         	He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
         
         Sheriff	Good night, my noble lord.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I think it is good morrow, is it not?
         
         Sheriff	Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
         
         	[Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier]
         
         PRINCE HENRY	This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,
         	call him forth.
         
         PETO	Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and
         	snorting  a horse.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
         
         	[He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers]
         
         	What hast thou found?
         
         PETO	Nothing but papers, my lord.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Let's see what they be: read them.
         
         PETO	[Reads]  Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.
         	Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.
         	Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.
         	Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.
         	Item, Bread,        ob.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
         	this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,
         	keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there
         	let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
         	morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
         	shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a
         	charge of foot; and I know his death will be a
         	march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
         	back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
         	the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         PETO	Good morrow, good my lord.
         
         
         
         
         	1 KING HENRY 
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.
         
         
         	[Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER]
         
         MORTIMER	These promises are fair, the parties sure,
         	And our induction full of prosperous hope.
         
         HOTSPUR	Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
         	Will you sit down?
         	And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
         	I have forgot the map.
         
         GLENDOWER	No, here it is.
         	Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,
         	For by that name as oft as Lancaster
         	Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
         	A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
         
         HOTSPUR	And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.
         
         GLENDOWER	I cannot blame him: at my nativity
         	The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
         	Of burning cressets; and at my birth
         	The frame and huge foundation of the earth
         	Shaked  a coward.
         
         HOTSPUR	Why, so it would have done at the same season, if
         	your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself
         	had never been born.
         
         GLENDOWER	I say the earth did shake when I was born.
         
         HOTSPUR	And I say the earth was not of my mind,
         	If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
         
         GLENDOWER	The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
         
         HOTSPUR	O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
         	And not in fear of your nativity.
         	Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
         	In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
         	Is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed
         	By the imprisoning of unruly wind
         	Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
         	Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
         	Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
         	Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
         	In passion shook.
         
         GLENDOWER	                  Cousin, of many men
         	I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
         	To tell you once again that at my birth
         	The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
         	The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
         	Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
         	These signs have marked me extraordinary;
         	And all the courses of my life do show
         	I am not in the roll of common men.
         	Where is he living, clipped in with the sea
         	That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
         	Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
         	And bring him out that is but woman's son
         	Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
         	And hold me pace in deep experiments.
         
         HOTSPUR	I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
         	I'll to dinner.
         
         MORTIMER	Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.
         
         GLENDOWER	I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
         
         HOTSPUR	Why, so can I, or so can any man;
         	But will they come when you do call for them?
         
         GLENDOWER	Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
         	The devil.
         
         HOTSPUR	And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
         	By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
         	If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
         	And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
         	O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
         
         MORTIMER	Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.
         
         GLENDOWER	Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
         	Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
         	And sandy-bottomed Severn have I sent him
         	Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
         
         HOTSPUR	Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
         	How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?
         
         GLENDOWER	Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
         	According to our threefold order ta'en?
         
         MORTIMER	The archdeacon hath divided it
         	Into three limits very equally:
         	England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
         	By south and east is to my part assigned:
         	All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
         	And all the fertile land within that bound,
         	To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
         	The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
         	And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
         	Which being sealed interchangeably,
         	A business that this night may execute,
         	To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
         	And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
         	To meet your father and the Scottish power,
         	As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
         	My father Glendower is not ready yet,
         	Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
         	Within that space you may have drawn together
         	Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.
         
         GLENDOWER	A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
         	And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
         	From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
         	For there will be a world of water shed
         	Upon the parting of your wives and you.
         
         HOTSPUR	Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
         	In quantity equals not one of yours:
         	See how this river comes me cranking in,
         	And cuts me from the best of all my land
         	A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
         	I'll have the current in this place dammed up;
         	And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
         	In a new channel, fair and evenly;
         	It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
         	To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
         
         GLENDOWER	Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.
         
         MORTIMER	Yea, but
         	Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
         	With  advantage on the other side;
         	Gelding the opposed continent as much
         	As on the other side it takes from you.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
         	And on this north side win this cape of land;
         	And then he runs straight and even.
         
         HOTSPUR	I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
         
         GLENDOWER	I'll not have it altered.
         
         HOTSPUR	Will not you?
         
         GLENDOWER	No, nor you shall not.
         
         HOTSPUR	Who shall say me nay?
         
         GLENDOWER	Why, that will I.
         
         HOTSPUR	Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.
         
         GLENDOWER	I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
         	For I was trained up in the English court;
         	Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
         	Many an English ditty lovely well
         	And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
         	A virtue that was never seen in you.
         
         HOTSPUR	Marry,
         	And I am glad of it with all my heart:
         	I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
         	Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
         	I had rather hear a brazen canstick turned,
         	Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
         	And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
         	Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
         	'Tis  the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
         
         GLENDOWER	Come, you shall have Trent turned.
         
         HOTSPUR	I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
         	To any well-deserving friend;
         	But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
         	I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
         	Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
         
         GLENDOWER	The moon shines fair; you may away by night:
         	I'll haste the writer and withal
         	Break with your wives of your departure hence:
         	I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
         	So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
         
         	[Exit GLENDOWER]
         
         MORTIMER	Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
         
         HOTSPUR	I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
         	With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
         	Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
         	And of a dragon and a finless fish,
         	A clip-winged griffin and a moulten raven,
         	A couching lion and a ramping cat,
         	And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
         	As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
         	He held me last night at least nine hours
         	In reckoning up the several devils' names
         	That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
         	But marked him not a word. O, he is as tedious
         	As a tired horse, a railing wife;
         	Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
         	With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
         	Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
         	In any summer-house in Christendom.
         
         MORTIMER	In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
         	Exceedingly well read, and profited
         	In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
         	And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
         	As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
         	He holds your temper in a high respect
         	And curbs himself even of his natural scope
         	When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:
         	I warrant you, that man is not alive
         	Might so have tempted him as you have done,
         	Without the taste of danger and reproof:
         	But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;
         	And since your coming hither have done enough
         	To put him quite beside his patience.
         	You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:
         	Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
         	And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
         	Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
         	Defect of manners, want of government,
         	Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:
         	The least of which haunting a nobleman
         	Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
         	Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
         	Beguiling them of commendation.
         
         HOTSPUR	Well, I am schooled: good manners be your speed!
         	Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.
         
         	[Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies]
         
         MORTIMER	This is the deadly spite that angers me;
         	My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
         
         GLENDOWER	My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;
         	She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
         
         MORTIMER	Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
         	Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
         
         	[Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she
         	answers him in the same]
         
         GLENDOWER	She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,
         	one that no persuasion can do good upon.
         
         	[The lady speaks in Welsh]
         
         MORTIMER	I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
         	Which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens
         	I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,
         	In such a parley should I answer thee.
         
         	[The lady speaks again in Welsh]
         
         	I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
         	And that's a feeling disputation:
         	But I will never be a truant, love,
         	Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue
         	Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penned,
         	Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
         	With ravishing division, to her lute.
         
         GLENDOWER	Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.
         
         	[The lady speaks again in Welsh]
         
         MORTIMER	O, I am ignorance itself in this!
         
         GLENDOWER	She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
         	And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
         	And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
         	And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
         	Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
         	Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
         	As is the difference betwixt day and night
         	The hour before the heavenly-harnessed team
         	Begins his golden progress in the east.
         
         MORTIMER	With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
         	By that time will our book, I think, be drawn
         
         GLENDOWER	Do so;
         	And those musicians that shall play to you
         	Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
         	And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.
         
         HOTSPUR	Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,
         	quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.
         
         LADY PERCY	Go, ye giddy goose.
         
         	[The music plays]
         
         HOTSPUR	Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
         	And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
         	By'r lady, he is a good musician.
         
         LADY PERCY	Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
         	altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,
         	and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
         
         HOTSPUR	I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
         
         LADY PERCY	Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
         
         HOTSPUR	No.
         
         LADY PERCY	Then be still.
         
         HOTSPUR	Neither;'tis a woman's fault.
         
         LADY PERCY	Now God help thee!
         
         HOTSPUR	To the Welsh lady's bed.
         
         LADY PERCY	What's that?
         
         HOTSPUR	Peace! she sings.
         
         	[Here the lady sings a Welsh song]
         
         HOTSPUR	Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.
         
         LADY PERCY	Not mine, in good sooth.
         
         HOTSPUR	Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear  a
         	comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and
         	'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and
         	'as sure as day,'
         	And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
         	As if thou never walkest further than Finsbury.
         	Swear me, Kate,  a lady as thou art,
         	A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
         	And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
         	To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
         	Come, sing.
         
         LADY PERCY	I will not sing.
         
         HOTSPUR	'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast
         	teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away
         	within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         GLENDOWER	Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow
         	As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
         	By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,
         	And then to horse immediately.

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	London. The palace.
         
         
         	[Enter KING HENRY , PRINCE HENRY, and others]
         
         KING HENRY 	Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
         	Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,
         	For we shall presently have need of you.
         
         	[Exeunt Lords]
         
         	I know not whether God will have it so,
         	For some displeasing service I have done,
         	That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
         	He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
         	But thou dost in thy passages of life
         	Make me believe that thou art only marked
         	For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
         	To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
         	Could such inordinate and low desires,
         	Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
         	Such barren pleasures, rude society,
         	As thou art matched withal and grafted to,
         	Accompany the greatness of thy blood
         	And hold their level with thy princely heart?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	So please your majesty, I would I could
         	Quit all offences with as clear excuse
         	As well as I am doubtless I can purge
         	Myself of many I am charged withal:
         	Yet such extenuation let me beg,
         	As, in reproof of many tales devised,
         	which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
         	By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,
         	I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
         	Hath faulty wandered and irregular,
         	Find pardon on my true submission.
         
         KING HENRY 	God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
         	At thy affections, which do hold a wing
         	Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
         	Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
         	Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
         	And art almost an alien to the hearts
         	Of all the court and princes of my blood:
         	The hope and expectation of thy time
         	Is ruined, and the soul of every man
         	Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
         	Had I so lavish of my presence been,
         	So common-hackneyed in the eyes of men,
         	So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
         	Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
         	Had still kept loyal to possession
         	And left me in reputeless banishment,
         	A fellow of no mark nor lihood.
         	By being seldom seen, I could not stir
         	But  a comet I was wondered at;
         	That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
         	Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
         	And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
         	And dressed myself in such humility
         	That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
         	Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
         	Even in the presence of the crowned king.
         	Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
         	My presence,  a robe pontifical,
         	never seen but wondered at: and so my state,
         	Seldom but sumptuous, showed  a feast
         	And won by rareness such solemnity.
         	The skipping king, he ambled up and down
         	With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
         	Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
         	Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
         	Had his great name profaned with their scorns
         	And gave his countenance, against his name,
         	To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
         	Of every beardless vain comparative,
         	Grew a companion to the common streets,
         	Enfeoffed himself to popularity;
         	That, being daily swallowed by men's eyes,
         	They surfeited with honey and began
         	To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
         	More than a little is by much too much.
         	So when he had occasion to be seen,
         	He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
         	Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
         	As, sick and blunted with community,
         	Afford no extraordinary gaze,
         	Such as is bent on sun- majesty
         	When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
         	But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
         	Slept in his face and rendered such aspect
         	As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
         	Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
         	And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
         	For thou has lost thy princely privilege
         	With vile participation: not an eye
         	But is a-weary of thy common sight,
         	Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
         	Which now doth that I would not have it do,
         	Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
         	Be more myself.
         
         KING HENRY 	                  For all the world
         	As thou art to this hour was Richard then
         	When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
         	And even as I was then is Percy now.
         	Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
         	He hath more worthy interest to the state
         	Than thou the shadow of succession;
         	For of no right, nor colour  to right,
         	He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
         	Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
         	And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
         	Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
         	To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
         	What never-dying honour hath he got
         	Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
         	Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
         	Holds from all soldiers chief majority
         	And military title capital
         	Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
         	Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
         	This infant warrior, in his enterprises
         	Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
         	Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
         	To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
         	And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
         	And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
         	The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
         	Capitulate against us and are up.
         	But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
         	Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
         	Which art my nearest and dearest enemy?
         	Thou that art  enough, through vassal fear,
         	Base inclination and the start of spleen
         	To fight against me under Percy's pay,
         	To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
         	To show how much thou art degenerate.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
         	And God forgive them that so much have swayed
         	Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
         	I will redeem all this on Percy's head
         	And in the closing of some glorious day
         	Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
         	When I will wear a garment all of blood
         	And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
         	Which, washed away, shall scour my shame with it:
         	And that shall be the day, whenever it lights,
         	That this same child of honour and renown,
         	This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
         	And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
         	For every honour sitting on his helm,
         	Would they were multitudes, and on my head
         	My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
         	That I shall make this northern youth exchange
         	His glorious deeds for my indignities.
         	Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
         	To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
         	And I will call him to so strict account,
         	That he shall render every glory up,
         	Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
         	Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
         	This, in the name of God, I promise here:
         	The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
         	I do beseech your majesty may salve
         	The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
         	If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
         	And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
         	Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
         
         KING HENRY 	A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
         	Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
         
         	[Enter BLUNT]
         
         	How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.
         
         SIR WALTER BLUNT	So hath the business that I come to speak of.
         	Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
         	That Douglas and the English rebels met
         	The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
         	A mighty and a fearful head they are,
         	If promises be kept on every hand,
         	As ever offered foul play in the state.
         
         KING HENRY 	The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;
         	With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;
         	For this advertisement is five days old:
         	On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;
         	On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
         	Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march
         	Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
         	Our business valued, some twelve days hence
         	Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
         	Our hands are full of business: let's away;
         	Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.

         	[Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]
         
         FALSTAFF	Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
         	action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
         	skin hangs about me  an  an old lady's loose
         	gown; I am withered  an old apple-john. Well,
         	I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
         	liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
         	shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
         	forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I
         	am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a
         	church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
         	spoil of me.
         
         BARDOLPH	Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.
         
         FALSTAFF	Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make
         	me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
         	need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not
         	above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once
         	in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I
         	borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in
         	good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
         	of all compass.
         
         BARDOLPH	Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs
         	be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
         	compass, Sir John.
         
         FALSTAFF	Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:
         	thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
         	the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the
         	Knight of the Burning Lamp.
         
         BARDOLPH	Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
         
         FALSTAFF	No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many
         	a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
         	never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
         	Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
         	robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way
         	given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath
         	should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but
         	thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but
         	for the light in thy face, the son of utter
         	darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the
         	night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou
         	hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,
         	there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a
         	perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
         	Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
         	torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
         	tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
         	drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
         	at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
         	maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
         	time this two and thirty years; God reward me for
         	it!
         
         BARDOLPH	'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!

         	[Enter Hostess]
         
         	How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired
         	yet who picked my pocket?
         
         Hostess	Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you
         	think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,
         	I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy
         	by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
         	was never lost in my house before.
         
         FALSTAFF	Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many
         	a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
         	to, you are a woman, go.
         
         Hostess	Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never
         	called so in mine own house before.
         
         FALSTAFF	Go to, I know you well enough.
         
         Hostess	No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know
         	you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now
         	you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
         	you a dozen of shirts to your back.
         
         FALSTAFF	Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
         	bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.
         
         Hostess	Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight
         	shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir
         	John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent
         	you, four and twenty pound.
         
         FALSTAFF	He had his part of it; let him pay.
         
         Hostess	He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.
         
         FALSTAFF	How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?
         	let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
         	Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
         	of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
         	shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
         	seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
         
         Hostess	O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not
         	how oft, that ring was copper!
         
         FALSTAFF	How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an
         	he were here, I would cudgel him  a dog, if he
         	would say so.

         	must we all march?

         	and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
         	bawdy-house; they pick pockets.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	What didst thou lose, Jack?
         
         FALSTAFF	Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of
         	forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
         	grandfather's.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	A trifle, some eight-penny matter.
         
         Hostess	So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your
         	grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely
         	of you,  a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said
         	he would cudgel you.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	What! he did not?
         
         Hostess	There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
         
         FALSTAFF	There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
         	prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
         	fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
         	deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
         	go
         
         Hostess	Say, what thing? what thing?
         
         FALSTAFF	What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.
         
         Hostess	I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou
         	shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,
         	setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to
         	call me so.
         
         FALSTAFF	Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
         	otherwise.
         
         Hostess	Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
         
         FALSTAFF	What beast! why, an otter.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?
         
         FALSTAFF	Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not
         	where to have her.
         
         Hostess	Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
         	man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.
         
         Hostess	So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you
         	ought him a thousand pound.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
         
         FALSTAFF	A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth
         	a million: thou owest me thy love.
         
         Hostess	Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would
         	cudgel you.
         
         FALSTAFF	Did I, Bardolph?
         
         BARDOLPH	Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
         
         FALSTAFF	Yea, if he said my ring was copper.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
         
         FALSTAFF	Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:
         	but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the
         	roaring of a lion's whelp.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	And why not as the lion?
         
         FALSTAFF	The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
         	think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
         	I do, I pray God my girdle break.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy
         	knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,
         	truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all
         	filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
         	woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,
         	impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in
         	thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of
         	bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of
         	sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket
         	were enriched with any other injuries but these, I
         	am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will
         	not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
         
         FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of
         	innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack
         	Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
         	have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
         	frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	It appears so by the story.
         
         FALSTAFF	Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;
         	love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy
         	guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
         	reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,
         	prithee, be gone.
         
         	[Exit Hostess]
         
         	Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,
         	lad, how is that answered?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to
         	thee: the money is paid back again.
         
         FALSTAFF	O, I do not  that paying back; 'tis a double labour.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
         
         FALSTAFF	Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and
         	do it with unwashed hands too.
         
         BARDOLPH	Do, my lord.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
         
         FALSTAFF	I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
         	one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
         	age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
         	heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for
         	these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I
         	laud them, I praise them.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Bardolph!
         
         BARDOLPH	My lord?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my
         	brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
         
         	[Exit Bardolph]
         
         	Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have
         	thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
         
         	[Exit Peto]
         
         	Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two
         	o'clock in the afternoon.
         	There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive
         	Money and order for their furniture.
         	The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
         	And either we or they must lower lie.
         
         	[Exit PRINCE HENRY]
         
         FALSTAFF	Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
         	O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         
         
         
         	1 KING HENRY 
         
         
         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE I	The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
         
         
         	[Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS]
         
         HOTSPUR	Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth
         	In this fine age were not thought flattery,
         	Such attribution should the Douglas have,
         	As not a soldier of this season's stamp
         	Should go so general current through the world.
         	By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy
         	The tongues of soothers; but a braver place
         	In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
         	Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	Thou art the king of honour:
         	No man so potent breathes upon the ground
         	But I will beard him.
         
         HOTSPUR	Do so, and 'tis well.
         
         	[Enter a Messenger with letters]
         
         	What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
         
         Messenger	These letters come from your father.
         
         HOTSPUR	Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
         
         Messenger	He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.
         
         HOTSPUR	'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
         	In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
         	Under whose government come they along?
         
         Messenger	His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
         
         Messenger	He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
         	And at the time of my departure thence
         	He was much feared by his physicians.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	I would the state of time had first been whole
         	Ere he by sickness had been visited:
         	His health was never better worth than now.
         
         HOTSPUR	Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
         	The very life-blood of our enterprise;
         	'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
         	He writes me here, that inward sickness--
         	And that his friends by deputation could not
         	So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
         	To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
         	On any soul removed but on his own.
         	Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
         	That with our small conjunction we should on,
         	To see how fortune is disposed to us;
         	For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.
         	Because the king is certainly possessed
         	Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
         
         HOTSPUR	A perilous gash, a very limb lopped off:
         	And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want
         	Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
         	To set the exact wealth of all our states
         	All at one cast? to set so rich a main
         	On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
         	It were not good; for therein should we read
         	The very bottom and the soul of hope,
         	The very list, the very utmost bound
         	Of all our fortunes.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	'Faith, and so we should;
         	Where now remains a sweet reversion:
         	We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
         	Is to come in:
         	A comfort of retirement lives in this.
         
         HOTSPUR	A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.
         	If that the devil and mischance look big
         	Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	But yet I would your father had been here.
         	The quality and hair of our attempt
         	Brooks no division: it will be thought
         	By some, that know not why he is away,
         	That wisdom, loyalty and mere dis
         	Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
         	And think how such an apprehension
         	May turn the tide of fearful faction
         	And breed a kind of question in our cause;
         	For well you know we of the offering side
         	Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
         	And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
         	The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
         	This absence of your father's draws a curtain,
         	That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
         	Before not dreamt of.
         
         HOTSPUR	You strain too far.
         	I rather of his absence make this use:
         	It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
         	A larger dare to our great enterprise,
         	Than if the earl were here; for men must think,
         	If we without his help can make a head
         	To push against a kingdom, with his help
         	We shall overturn it topsy-turvy down.
         	Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	As heart can think: there is not such a word
         	Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
         
         	[Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON]
         
         HOTSPUR	My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.
         
         VERNON	Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
         	The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,
         	Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.
         
         HOTSPUR	No harm: what more?
         
         VERNON	And further, I have learned,
         	The king himself in person is set forth,
         	Or hitherwards intended speedily,
         	With strong and mighty preparation.
         
         HOTSPUR	He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
         	The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
         	And his comrades, that daffed the world aside,
         	And bid it pass?
         
         VERNON	                  All furnished, all in arms;
         	All plumed  estridges that with the wind
         	Baited  eagles having lately bathed;
         	Glittering in golden coats,  images;
         	As full of spirit as the month of May,
         	And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
         	Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
         	I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,
         	His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly armed
         	Rise from the ground  feathered Mercury,
         	And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
         	As if an angel dropped down from the clouds,
         	To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
         	And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
         
         HOTSPUR	No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,
         	This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
         	They come  sacrifices in their trim,
         	And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
         	All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
         	The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
         	Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
         	To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
         	And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,
         	Who is to bear me  a thunderbolt
         	Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
         	Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
         	Meet and never part till one drop down a corse.
         	O that Glendower were come!
         
         VERNON	There is more news:
         	I learned in Worcester, as I rode along,
         	He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
         
         WORCESTER	Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
         
         HOTSPUR	What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
         
         VERNON	To thirty thousand.
         
         HOTSPUR	Forty let it be:
         	My father and Glendower being both away,
         	The powers of us may serve so great a day
         	Come, let us take a muster speedily:
         	Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
         	Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	A public road near Coventry.
         
         
         	[Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]
         
         FALSTAFF	Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
         	bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;
         	we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.
         
         BARDOLPH	Will you give me money, captain?
         
         FALSTAFF	Lay out, lay out.
         
         BARDOLPH	This bottle makes an angel.
         
         FALSTAFF	An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make
         	twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid
         	my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
         
         BARDOLPH	I will, captain: farewell.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         FALSTAFF	If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
         	gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
         	I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
         	soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
         	none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
         	me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
         	twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
         	as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
         	fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
         	fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
         	toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
         	bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
         	their services; and now my whole charge consists of
         	ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
         	companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
         	painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
         	sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
         	discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
         	younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
         	trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
         	long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
         	an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
         	the rooms of them that have bought out their
         	services, that you would think that I had a hundred
         	and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
         	swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
         	fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
         	all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
         	hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
         	Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
         	villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
         	gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
         	prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
         	company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked

         	herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
         	the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
         	the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all

         FALSTAFF	What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou
         	in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I
         	cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
         	at Shrewsbury.
         
         WESTMORELAND	Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were
         	there, and you too; but my powers are there already.
         	The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must
         	away all night.
         
         FALSTAFF	Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to
         	steal cream.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath
         	already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose
         	fellows are these that come after?
         
         FALSTAFF	Mine, Hal, mine.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I did never see such pitiful rascals.
         
         FALSTAFF	Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food
         	for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:
         	tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.
         
         WESTMORELAND	Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor
         	and bare, too beggarly.
         
         FALSTAFF	'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had
         	that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never
         	learned that of me.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on
         	the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is
         	already in the field.
         
         FALSTAFF	What, is the king encamped?
         
         WESTMORELAND	He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.
         
         FALSTAFF	Well,
         	To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
         	Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.

         HOTSPUR	We'll fight with him to-night.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	It may not be.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	You give him then the advantage.
         
         VERNON	Not a whit.
         
         HOTSPUR	Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
         
         VERNON	So do we.
         
         HOTSPUR	        His is certain, ours is doubtful.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.
         
         VERNON	Do not, my lord.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	                  You do not counsel well:
         	You speak it out of fear and cold heart.

         	And I dare well maintain it with my life,

         	I hold as little counsel with weak fear

         	Which of us fears.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	                  Yea, or to-night.
         
         VERNON	Content.
         
         HOTSPUR	To-night, say I.
         
         VERNON	Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,
         	Being men of such great leading as you are,
         	That you foresee not what impediments
         	Drag back our expedition: certain horse
         	Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
         	Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;
         	And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
         	Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
         	That not a horse is half the half of himself.
         
         HOTSPUR	So are the horses of the enemy
         	In general, journey-bated and brought low:
         	The better part of ours are full of rest.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	The number of the king exceedeth ours:
         	For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.
         
         	[The trumpet sounds a parley]
         
         	[Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT]
         
         SIR WALTER BLUNT	I come with gracious offers from the king,
         	if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.
         
         HOTSPUR	Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
         	You were of our determination!
         	Some of us love you well; and even those some
         	Envy your great deservings and good name,
         	Because you are not of our quality,
         	But stand against us  an enemy.
         
         SIR WALTER BLUNT	And God defend but still I should stand so,
         	So long as out of limit and true rule
         	You stand against anointed majesty.
         	But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
         	The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
         	You conjure from the breast of civil peace
         	Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
         	Audacious cruelty. If that the king
         	Have any way your good deserts forgot,
         	Which he confesseth to be manifold,
         	He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed
         	You shall have your desires with interest
         	And pardon absolute for yourself and these
         	Herein misled by your suggestion.
         
         HOTSPUR	The king is kind; and well we know the king
         	Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
         	My father and my uncle and myself
         	Did give him that same royalty he wears;
         	And when he was not six and twenty strong,
         	Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
         	A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
         	My father gave him welcome to the shore;
         	And when he heard him swear and vow to God
         	He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
         	To sue his livery and beg his peace,
         	With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
         	My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
         	Swore him assistance and performed it too.
         	Now when the lords and barons of the realm
         	Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
         	The more and less came in with cap and knee;
         	Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
         	Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
         	Laid gifts before him, proffered him their oaths,
         	Gave him their heirs, as pages followed him
         	Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
         	He presently, as greatness knows itself,
         	Steps me a little higher than his vow
         	Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
         	Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
         	And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
         	Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
         	That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
         	Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
         	Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
         	This seeming brow of justice, did he win
         	The hearts of all that he did angle for;
         	Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
         	Of all the favourites that the absent king
         	In deputation left behind him here,
         	When he was personal in the Irish war.
         
         SIR WALTER BLUNT	Tut, I came not to hear this.
         
         HOTSPUR	Then to the point.
         	In short time after, he deposed the king;
         	Soon after that, deprived him of his life;
         	And in the neck of that, tasked the whole state:
         	To make that worse, suffered his kinsman March,
         	Who is, if every owner were well placed,
         	Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
         	There without ransom to lie forfeited;
         	Disgraced me in my happy victories,
         	Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
         	Rated mine uncle from the council-board;
         	In rage dismissed my father from the court;
         	Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
         	And in conclusion drove us to seek out
         	This head of safety; and withal to pry
         	Into his title, the which we find
         	Too indirect for long continuance.
         
         SIR WALTER BLUNT	Shall I return this answer to the king?
         
         HOTSPUR	Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.
         	Go to the king; and let there be impawned
         	Some surety for a safe return again,
         	And in the morning early shall my uncle
         	Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.
         
         SIR WALTER BLUNT	I would you would accept of grace and love.
         
         HOTSPUR	And may be so we shall.

         	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL]
         
         ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
         	With winged haste to the lord marshal;
         	This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
         	To whom they are directed. If you knew
         	How much they do to import, you would make haste.
         
         SIR MICHAEL	My good lord,
         	I guess their tenor.
         
         ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	 enough you do.
         	To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
         	Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
         	Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
         	As I am truly given to understand,
         	The king with mighty and quick-raised power
         	Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
         	What with the sickness of Northumberland,
         	Whose power was in the first proportion,
         	And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
         	Who with them was a rated sinew too
         	And comes not in, over-ruled by prophecies,
         	I fear the power of Percy is too weak
         	To wage an instant trial with the king.
         
         SIR MICHAEL	Why, my good lord, you need not fear;
         	There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
         
         ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	No, Mortimer is not there.
         
         SIR MICHAEL	But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
         	And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
         	Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.
         
         ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
         	The special head of all the land together:
         	The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
         	The noble Westmoreland and war Blunt;
         	And moe corrivals and dear men
         	Of estimation and command in arms.
         
         SIR MICHAEL	Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
         
         ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;
         	And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:
         	For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king
         	Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,
         	For he hath heard of our confederacy,
         	And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
         	Therefore make haste. I must go write again
         	To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.

         KING HENRY 	How bloodily the sun begins to peer
         	Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
         	At his distemperature.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	The southern wind
         	Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
         	And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
         	Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
         
         KING HENRY 	Then with the losers let it sympathize,
         	For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
         
         	[The trumpet sounds]
         
         	[Enter WORCESTER and VERNON]
         
         	How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
         	That you and I should meet upon such terms
         	As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
         	And made us doff our easy robes of peace,
         	To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
         	This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
         	What say you to it? will you again unknit
         	This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
         	And move in that obedient orb again
         	Where you did give a fair and natural light,
         	And be no more an exhaled meteor,
         	A prodigy of fear and a portent
         	Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Hear me, my liege:
         	For mine own part, I could be well content
         	To entertain the lag-end of my life
         	With quiet hours; for I do protest,
         	I have not sought the day of this dis.
         
         KING HENRY 	You have not sought it! how comes it, then?
         
         FALSTAFF	Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Peace, chewet, peace!
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
         	Of favour from myself and all our house;
         	And yet I must remember you, my lord,
         	We were the first and dearest of your friends.
         	For you my staff of office did I break
         	In Richard's time; and posted day and night
         	to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
         	When yet you were in place and in account
         	Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
         	It was myself, my brother and his son,
         	That brought you home and boldly did outdare
         	The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
         	And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
         	That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;
         	Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
         	The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:
         	To this we swore our aid. But in short space
         	It rained down fortune showering on your head;
         	And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
         	What with our help, what with the absent king,
         	What with the injuries of a wanton time,
         	The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
         	And the contrarious winds that held the king
         	So long in his unlucky Irish wars
         	That all in England did repute him dead:
         	And from this swarm of fair advantages
         	You took occasion to be quickly wooed
         	To gripe the general sway into your hand;
         	Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
         	And being fed by us you used us so
         	As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
         	Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
         	Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
         	That even our love durst not come near your sight
         	For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
         	We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
         	Out of sight and raise this present head;
         	Whereby we stand opposed by such means
         	As you yourself have forged against yourself
         	By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
         	And violation of all faith and troth
         	Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
         
         KING HENRY 	These things indeed you have articulate,
         	Proclaimed at market-crosses, read in churches,
         	To face the garment of rebellion
         	With some fine colour that may please the eye
         	Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
         	Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
         	Of hurlyburly innovation:
         	And never yet did insurrection want
         	Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
         	Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
         	Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	In both your armies there is many a soul
         	Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
         	If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,
         	The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
         	In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,
         	This present enterprise set off his head,
         	I do not think a braver gentleman,
         	More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
         	More daring or more bold, is now alive
         	To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
         	For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
         	I have a truant been to chivalry;
         	And so I hear he doth account me too;
         	Yet this before my father's majesty--
         	I am content that he shall take the odds
         	Of his great name and estimation,
         	And will, to save the blood on either side,
         	Try fortune with him in a single fight.
         
         KING HENRY 	And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
         	Albeit considerations infinite
         	Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
         	We love our people well; even those we love
         	That are misled upon your cousin's part;

         	Both he and they and you, every man
         	Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
         	So tell your cousin, and bring me word
         	What he will do: but if he will not yield,
         	Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
         	And they shall do their office. So, be gone;
         	We will not now be troubled with reply:

         PRINCE HENRY	It will not be accepted, on my life:

         	Are confident against the world in arms.
         
         KING HENRY 	Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;
         	For, on their answer, will we set on them:
         	And God befriend us, as our cause is just!

         	me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
         	Say thy prayers, and farewell.
         
         FALSTAFF	I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Why, thou owest God a death.
         
         	[Exit PRINCE HENRY]
         
         FALSTAFF	'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before
         	his day. What need I be so forward with him that
         	calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks
         	me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
         	come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
         	an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
         	Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
         	honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
         	is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
         	he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
         	Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,
         	to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
         	no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
         	I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
         	ends my catechism.

         EARL OF WORCESTER	O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
         	The liberal and kind offer of the king.
         
         VERNON	'Twere best he did.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	Then are we all undone.
         	It is not possible, it cannot be,
         	The king should keep his word in loving us;
         	He will suspect us still and find a time
         	To punish this offence in other faults:
         	Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
         	For treason is but trusted  the fox,
         	Who, never so tame, so cherished and locked up,
         	Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
         	Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
         	Interpretation will misquote our looks,
         	And we shall feed  oxen at a stall,
         	The better cherished, still the nearer death.
         	My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
         	it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
         	And an adopted name of privilege,
         	A hair-brained Hotspur, governed by a spleen:
         	All his offences live upon my head
         	And on his father's; we did train him on,
         	And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
         	We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
         	Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
         	In any case, the offer of the king.
         
         VERNON	Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
         	Here comes your cousin.

         EARL OF WORCESTER	The king will bid you battle presently.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
         
         HOTSPUR	Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.

         EARL OF WORCESTER	There is no seeming mercy in the king.
         
         HOTSPUR	Did you beg any? God forbid!
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	I told him gently of our grievances,
         	Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
         	By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
         	He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
         	With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
         
         	[Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS]
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown
         	A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
         	And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;
         	Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	The Prince of Wales stepped forth before the king,
         	And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.
         
         HOTSPUR	O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
         	And that no man might draw short breath today
         	But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,
         	How showed his tasking? seemed it in contempt?
         
         VERNON	No, by my soul; I never in my life
         	Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,
         	Unless a brother should a brother dare
         	To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
         	He gave you all the duties of a man;
         	Trimmed up your praises with a princely tongue,
         	Spoke to your deservings  a chronicle,
         	Making you ever better than his praise
         	By still dispraising praise valued in you;
         	And, which became him  a prince indeed,
         	He made a blushing cital of himself;
         	And chid his truant youth with such a grace
         	As if he mastered there a double spirit.
         	Of teaching and of learning instantly.
         	There did he pause: but let me tell the world,
         	If he outlive the envy of this day,
         	England did never owe so sweet a hope,
         	So much misconstrued in his wantonness.
         
         HOTSPUR	Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
         	On his follies: never did I hear
         	Of any prince so wild a libertine.
         	But be he as he will, yet once ere night
         	I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
         	That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
         	Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,
         	Better consider what you have to do
         	Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,

         	O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
         	To spend that shortness basely were too long,
         	If life did ride upon a dial's point,
         	Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
         	An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
         	If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
         	Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,
         	When the intent of bearing them is just.

         	For I profess not talking; only this--
         	Let each man do his best: and here draw I
         	A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
         	With the best blood that I can meet withal
         	In the adventure of this perilous day.
         	Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
         	Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
         	And by that music let us all embrace;

         	Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek

         EARL OF DOUGLAS	                  Know then, my name is Douglas;
         	And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
         	Because some tell me that thou art a king.
         
         SIR WALTER BLUNT	They tell thee true.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
         	Thy ness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
         	This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
         	Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
         
         SIR WALTER BLUNT	I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
         	And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
         	Lord Stafford's death.

         EARL OF DOUGLAS	Here.
         
         HOTSPUR	This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:
         	A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
         	Semblably furnished  the king himself.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
         	A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
         	Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
         
         HOTSPUR	The king hath many marching in his coats.
         
         EARL OF DOUGLAS	Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;

         	Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
         	for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
         	lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I
         	need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
         	led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
         	not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and
         	they are for the town's end, to beg during life.

         HOTSPUR	Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
         	To end the one of us; and would to God
         	Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
         	And all the budding honours on thy crest
         	I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.
         
         HOTSPUR	I can no longer brook thy vanities.
         
         	[They fight]
         
         	[Enter FALSTAFF]
         
         FALSTAFF	Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no
         	boy's play here, I can tell you.
         
         	[Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF,
         	who falls down as if he were dead, and exit
         	DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls]
         
         HOTSPUR	O, Harry, thou hast robbed me of my youth!
         	I better brook the loss of brittle life
         	Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
         	They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
         	But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
         	And time, that takes survey of all the world,
         	Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
         	But that the earthy and cold hand of death
         	Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust
         	And food for--
         
         	[Dies]
         
         PRINCE HENRY	For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!
         	Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
         	When that this body did contain a spirit,
         	A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
         	But now two paces of the vilest earth
         	Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
         	Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
         	If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
         	I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
         	But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
         	And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
         	For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
         	Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
         	Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
         	But not remembered in thy epitaph!
         
         	[He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground]
         
         	What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
         	Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
         	I could have better spared a better man:
         	O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
         	If I were much in love with vanity!
         	Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
         	Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
         	Embowelled will I see thee by and by:
         	Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
         
         	[Exit PRINCE HENRY]
         
         FALSTAFF	[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,
         	I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
         	to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or
         	that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
         	Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,
         	is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the
         	counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
         	but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby
         	liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and
         	perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
         	valour is discretion; in the which better part I
         	have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this
         	gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he
         	should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am
         	afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
         	Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I
         	killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
         	Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.
         	Therefore, sirrah,
         
         	[Stabbing him]
         
         	with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.
         
         	[Takes up HOTSPUR on his back]
         
         	[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER]
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou fleshed
         	Thy maiden sword.
         
         LANCASTER	                  But, soft! whom have we here?
         	Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
         
         PRINCE HENRY	I did; I saw him dead,
         	Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
         	thou alive?
         	Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
         	I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes
         	Without our ears: thou art not what thou seemest.
         
         FALSTAFF	No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I
         	be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:
         
         	[Throwing the body down]
         
         	if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let
         	him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
         	earl or duke, I can assure you.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.
         
         FALSTAFF	Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
         	lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
         	and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
         	fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
         	believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
         	valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
         	it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
         	thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
         	'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.
         
         LANCASTER	This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
         
         PRINCE HENRY	This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
         	Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
         	For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
         	I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
         
         	[A retreat is sounded]
         
         	The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
         	Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
         	To see what friends are living, who are dead.
         
         	[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER]
         
         FALSTAFF	I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
         	rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
         	I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
         	live cleanly as a nobleman should do.

         	Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
         	Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
         	And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
         	Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
         	Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
         	A noble earl and many a creature else
         	Had been alive this hour,
         	If  a Christian thou hadst truly borne
         	Betwixt our armies true intelligence.
         
         EARL OF WORCESTER	What I have done my safety urged me to;
         	And I embrace this fortune patiently,
         	Since not to be avoided it falls on me.
         
         KING HENRY 	Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:
         	Other offenders we will pause upon.
         
         	[Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded]

         PRINCE HENRY	The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
         	The fortune of the day quite turned from him,
         	The noble Percy slain, and all his men
         	Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
         	And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
         	That the pursuers took him. At my tent
         	The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace
         	I may dispose of him.
         
         KING HENRY 	With all my heart.
         
         
         PRINCE HENRY	Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
         	This honourable bounty shall belong:
         	Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
         	Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
         	His valour shown upon our crests to-day
         	Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
         	Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
         
         LANCASTER	I thank your grace for this high courtesy,
         	Which I shall give away immediately.
         
         KING HENRY 	Then this remains, that we divide our power.
         	You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland
         	Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,
         	To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
         	Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:
         	Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
         	To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
         	Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
         	Meeting the cheque of such another day:
         	And since this business so fair is done,

         KING RICHARD 	Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,
         	Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,

         	Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,

         JOHN OF GAUNT	I have, my liege.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
         	If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
         	Or worthily, as a good subject should,
         	On some known ground of treachery in him?
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	As near as I could sift him on that argument,
         	On some apparent danger seen in him
         	Aimed at your highness, no inveterate malice.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Then call them to our presence; face to face,
         	And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
         	The accuser and the accused freely speak:
         	High-stomached are they both, and full of ire,
         	In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

         	Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
         	Add an immortal title to your crown!
         
         KING RICHARD 	We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
         	As well appeareth by the cause you come;
         	Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
         	Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
         	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	First, heaven be the record to my speech!
         	In the devotion of a subject's love,
         	Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
         	And free from other misbegotten hate,
         	Come I appellant to this princely presence.
         	Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
         	And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
         	My body shall make good upon this earth,
         	Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
         	Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
         	Too good to be so and too bad to live,
         	Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
         	The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
         	Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
         	With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
         	And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
         	What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
         	'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
         	The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
         	Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
         	The blood is hot that must be cooled for this:
         	Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
         	As to be hushed and nought at all to say:
         	First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
         	From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
         	Which else would post until it had returned
         	These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
         	Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
         	And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
         	I do defy him, and I spit at him;
         	Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
         	Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
         	And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
         	Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
         	Or any other ground inhabitable,
         	Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
         	Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
         	By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
         	Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
         	And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
         	Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
         	If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
         	As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
         	By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
         	Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
         	What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	I take it up; and by that sword I swear
         	Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
         	I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
         	Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
         	And when I mount, alive may I not light,
         	If I be traitor or unjustly fight!
         
         KING RICHARD 	What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
         	It must be great that can inherit us
         	So much as of a thought of ill in him.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
         	That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
         	In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
         	The which he hath detained for lewd employments,
         	 a false traitor and injurious villain.
         	Besides I say and will in battle prove,
         	Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
         	That ever was surveyed by English eye,
         	That all the treasons for these eighteen years
         	Complotted and contrived in this land
         	Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
         	Further I say and further will maintain
         	Upon his bad life to make all this good,
         	That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
         	Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
         	And consequently,  a traitor coward,
         	Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
         	Which blood,  sacrificing Abel's, cries,
         	Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
         	To me for justice and rough chastisement;
         	And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
         	This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
         
         KING RICHARD 	How high a pitch his resolution soars!
         	Thomas of Norfolk, what sayest thou to this?
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	O, let my sovereign turn away his face
         	And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
         	Till I have told this slander of his blood,
         	How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
         	Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
         	As he is but my father's brother's son,
         	Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
         	Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
         	Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
         	The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
         	He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
         	Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
         	Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
         	Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
         	Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
         	The other part reserved I by consent,
         	For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
         	Upon remainder of a dear account,
         	Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
         	Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
         	I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
         	Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
         	For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
         	The honourable father to my foe
         	Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
         	A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
         	But ere I last received the sacrament
         	I did confess it, and exactly begged
         	Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
         	This is my fault: as for the rest appealled,
         	It issues from the rancour of a villain,
         	A recreant and most degenerate traitor
         	Which in myself I boldly will defend;
         	And interchangeably hurl down my gage
         	Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
         	To prove myself a loyal gentleman
         	Even in the best blood chambered in his bosom.
         	In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
         	Your highness to assign our trial day.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
         	Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
         	This we prescribe, though no physician;
         	Deep malice makes too deep incision;
         	Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
         	Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
         	Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
         	We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	To be a make-peace shall become my age:
         	Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.
         
         KING RICHARD 	And, Norfolk, throw down his.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	When, Harry, when?
         	Obedience bids I should not bid again.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
         	My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
         	The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
         	Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
         	To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
         	I am disgraced, impeached and baffled here,
         	Pierced to the soul with slander's venomed spear,
         	The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
         	Which breathed this poison.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Rage must be withstood:
         	Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
         	And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
         	The purest treasure mortal times afford
         	Is spotless reputation: that away,
         	Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
         	A jewel in a ten-times-barred-up chest
         	Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
         	Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
         	Take honour from me, and my life is done:
         	Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
         	In that I live and for that will I die.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
         	Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
         	Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
         	Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
         	Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
         	Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
         	The slavish motive of recanting fear,
         	And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
         	Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
         
         	[Exit JOHN OF GAUNT]
         
         KING RICHARD 	We were not born to sue, but to command;
         	Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
         	Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
         	At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
         	There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
         	The swelling difference of your settled hate:
         	Since we can not atone you, we shall see
         	Justice design the victor's chivalry.
         	Lord marshal, command our officers at arms
         	Be ready to direct these home alarms.

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace.
         
         
         	[Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS]
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
         	Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
         	To stir against the butchers of his life!
         	But since correction lieth in those hands
         	Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
         	Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
         	Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
         	Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
         
         DUCHESS	Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
         	Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
         	Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
         	Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
         	Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
         	Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
         	Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
         	But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
         	One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
         	One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
         	Is cracked, and all the precious liquor spilt,
         	Is hacked down, and his summer leaves all faded,
         	By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
         	Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
         	That metal, that self-mould, that fashioned thee
         	Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
         	Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
         	In some large measure to thy father's death,
         	In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
         	Who was the model of thy father's life.
         	Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
         	In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughtered,
         	Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
         	Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
         	That which in mean men we intitle patience
         	Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
         	What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
         	The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
         	His deputy anointed in His sight,
         	Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
         	Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
         	An angry arm against His minister.
         
         DUCHESS	Where then, alas, may I complain myself?
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	To God, the widow's champion and defence.
         
         DUCHESS	Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
         	Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
         	Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
         	O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
         	That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
         	Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
         	Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
         	They may break his foaming courser's back,
         	And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
         	A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
         	Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
         	With her companion grief must end her life.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
         	As much good stay with thee as go with me!
         
         DUCHESS	Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
         	Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
         	I take my leave before I have begun,
         	For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
         	Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
         	Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
         	Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
         	I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
         	With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
         	Alack, and what shall good old York there see
         	But empty lodgings and unfurnished walls,
         	Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
         	And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
         	Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
         	To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
         	Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
         	The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         	[Enter the Lord Marshal and the DUKE OF AUMERLE]
         
         Lord Marshal	My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford armed?
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
         
         Lord Marshal	The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
         	Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
         	For nothing but his majesty's approach.
         
         	[The trumpets sound, and KING RICHARD enters with
         	his nobles, JOHN OF GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GREEN, and
         	others. When they are set, enter THOMAS MOWBRAY in
         	arms, defendant, with a Herald]
         
         KING RICHARD 	Marshal, demand of yonder champion
         	The cause of his arrival here in arms:
         	Ask him his name and orderly proceed
         	To swear him in the justice of his cause.
         
         Lord Marshal	In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
         	And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,
         	Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:
         	Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;
         	As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
         	Who hither come engaged by my oath--
         	Which God defend a knight should violate!--
         	Both to defend my loyalty and truth
         	To God, my king and my succeeding issue,
         	Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
         	And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
         	To prove him, in defending of myself,
         	A traitor to my God, my king, and me:
         	And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
         
         	[The trumpets sound. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE,
         	appellant, in armour, with a Herald]
         
         KING RICHARD 	Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
         	Both who he is and why he cometh hither
         	Thus plated in habiliments of war,
         	And formally, according to our law,
         	Depose him in the justice of his cause.
         
         Lord Marshal	What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,
         	Before King Richard in his royal lists?
         	Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
         	Speak  a true knight, so defend thee heaven!
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby
         	Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
         	To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
         	In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
         	That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
         	To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;
         	And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
         
         Lord Marshal	On pain of death, no person be so bold
         	Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,

         	Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
         	Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O let no noble eye profane a tear
         	For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:
         	As confident as is the falcon's flight
         	Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.

         	Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
         	Not sick, although I have to do with death,
         	But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
         	Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
         	The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:
         	O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
         	Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
         	Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
         	To reach at victory above my head,
         	Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
         	And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
         	That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
         	And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,
         	Even in the lusty havior of his son.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
         	Be swift  lightning in the execution;
         	And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
         	Fall  amazing thunder on the casque
         	Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
         	Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.

         	A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
         	Never did captive with a freer heart
         	Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
         	His golden uncontrolled enfranchisement,
         	More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
         	This feast of battle with mine adversary.
         	Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
         	Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
         	As gentle and as jocund as to jest
         	Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Farewell, my lord: securely I espy
         	Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
         	Order the trial, marshal, and begin.
         
         Lord Marshal	Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,

         	And list what with our council we have done.
         	For that our kingdom's earth should not be soiled
         	With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
         	And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
         	Of civil wounds ploughed up with neighbours' sword;
         	And for we think the eagle-winged pride
         	Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
         	With rival-hating envy, set on you
         	To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle
         	Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
         	Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,
         	With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
         	And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
         	Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
         	And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,
         	Therefore, we banish you our territories:
         	You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
         	Till twice five summers have enriched our fields
         	Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
         	But tread the stranger paths of banishment.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
         	Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;
         	And those his golden beams to you here lent
         	Shall point on me and gild my banishment.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
         	Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
         	The sly slow hours shall not determinate
         	The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
         	The hopeless word of 'never to return'
         	Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
         	And all unlooked for from your highness' mouth:
         	A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
         	As to be cast forth in the common air,
         	Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
         	The language I have learned these forty years,
         	My native English, now I must forego:
         	And now my tongue's use is to me no more
         	Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
         	Or  a cunning instrument cased up,
         	Or, being open, put into his hands
         	That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
         	Within my mouth you have engaoled my tongue,
         	Doubly portcullised with my teeth and lips;
         	And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
         	Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
         	I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
         	Too far in years to be a pupil now:
         	What is thy sentence then but speechless death,
         	Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?
         
         KING RICHARD 	It boots thee not to be compassionate:
         	After our sentence plaining comes too late.
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	Then thus I turn me from my country's light,
         	To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Return again, and take an oath with thee.
         	Lay on our royal sword your banished hands;
         	Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
         	Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
         	To keep the oath that we administer:
         	You never shall, so help you truth and God!
         	Embrace each other's love in banishment;
         	Nor never look upon each other's face;
         	Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
         	This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
         	Nor never by advised purpose meet
         	To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
         	'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I swear.
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	And I, to keep all this.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--
         	By this time, had the king permitted us,
         	One of our souls had wandered in the air.
         	Banished this frail sepulchre of our flesh,
         	As now our flesh is banished from this land:
         	Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
         	Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
         	The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.
         
         THOMAS MOWBRAY	No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
         	My name be blotted from the book of life,
         	And I from heaven banished as from hence!
         	But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
         	And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
         	Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
         	Save back to England, all the world's my way.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING RICHARD 	Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
         	I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
         	Hath from the number of his banished years
         	Plucked four away.
         
         	[To HENRY BOLINGBROKE]
         
         	Six frozen winter spent,
         	Return with welcome home from banishment.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	How long a time lies in one little word!
         	Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
         	End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	I thank my liege, that in regard of me
         	He shortens four years of my son's exile:
         	But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
         	For, ere the six years that he hath to spend
         	Can change their moons and bring their times about
         	My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
         	Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
         	My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
         	And blindfold death not let me see my son.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:
         	Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,
         	And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
         	Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
         	But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
         	Thy word is current with him for my death,
         	But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Thy son is banished upon good advice,
         	Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
         	Why at our justice seemest thou then to lour?
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
         	You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
         	You would have bid me argue  a father.
         	O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
         	To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
         	A partial slander sought I to avoid,
         	And in the sentence my own life destroyed.
         	Alas, I looked when some of you should say,
         	I was too strict to make mine own away;
         	But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
         	Against my will to do myself this wrong.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
         	Six years we banish him, and he shall go.
         
         	[Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD  and train]
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
         	From where you do remain let paper show.
         
         Lord Marshal	My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
         	As far as land will let me, by your side.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
         	That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends?
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I have too few to take my leave of you,
         	When the tongue's office should be prodigal
         	To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	What is six winters? they are quickly gone.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
         	Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	The sullen passage of thy weary steps
         	Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
         	The precious jewel of thy home return.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
         	Will but remember me what a deal of world
         	I wander from the jewels that I love.
         	Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
         	To foreign passages, and in the end,
         	Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
         	But that I was a journeyman to grief?
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	All places that the eye of heaven visits
         	Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
         	Teach thy necessity to reason thus;
         	There is no virtue  necessity.
         	Think not the king did banish thee,
         	But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
         	Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
         	Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
         	And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
         	Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
         	And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
         	Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
         	To lie that way thou goest, not whence thou comest:
         	Suppose the singing birds musicians,
         	The grass whereon thou treadest the presence strewed,
         	The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
         	Than a delightful measure or a dance;
         	For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
         	The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O, who can hold a fire in his hand
         	By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
         	Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
         	By bare imagination of a feast?
         	Or wallow naked in December snow
         	By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
         	O, no! the apprehension of the good
         	Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
         	Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
         	Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
         	Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
         	My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
         	Wherever I wander, boast of this I can,
         	Though banished, yet a trueborn Englishman.

         	door; and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another]
         
         KING RICHARD 	We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
         	How far brought you high Hereford on his way?
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
         	But to the next highway, and there I left him.
         
         KING RICHARD 	And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
         	Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
         	Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
         	Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
         
         KING RICHARD 	What said our cousin when you parted with him?
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	'Farewell:'
         	And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
         	Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
         	To counterfeit oppression of such grief
         	That words seemed buried in my sorrow's grave.
         	Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthened hours
         	And added years to his short banishment,
         	He should have had a volume of farewells;
         	But since it would not, he had none of me.
         
         KING RICHARD 	He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
         	When time shall call him home from banishment,
         	Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
         	Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
         	Observed his courtship to the common people;
         	How he did seem to dive into their hearts
         	With humble and familiar courtesy,
         	What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
         	Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
         	And patient underbearing of his fortune,
         	As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
         	Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
         	A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
         	And had the tribute of his supple knee,
         	With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
         	As were our England in reversion his,
         	And he our subjects' next degree in hope.
         
         GREEN	Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
         	Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
         	Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
         	Ere further leisure yield them further means
         	For their advantage and your highness' loss.
         
         KING RICHARD 	We will ourself in person to this war:
         	And, for our coffers, with too great a court
         	And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
         	We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
         	The revenue whereof shall furnish us
         	For our affairs in hand: if that come short,
         	Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
         	Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
         	They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
         	And send them after to supply our wants;
         	For we will make for Ireland presently.
         
         	[Enter BUSHY]

         BUSHY	Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
         	Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
         	To entreat your majesty to visit him.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Where lies he?
         
         BUSHY	At Ely House.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
         	To help him to his grave immediately!
         	The lining of his coffers shall make coats
         	To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
         	Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
         	Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!

         	&amp;c]
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	Will the king come, that I may breathe my last
         	In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
         	For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	O, but they say the tongues of dying men
         	Enforce attention  deep harmony:
         	Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
         	For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
         	He that no more must say is listened more
         	Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
         	More are men's ends marked than their lives before:
         	The setting sun, and music at the close,
         	As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
         	Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
         	Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
         	My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	No; it is stopped with other flattering sounds,
         	As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
         	Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
         	The open ear of youth doth always listen;
         	Report of fashions in proud Italy,
         	Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
         	Limps after in base imitation.
         	Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
         	So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
         	That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
         	Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
         	Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
         	Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
         	'Tis breath thou lackest, and that breath wilt thou lose.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
         	And thus expiring do foretell of him:
         	His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
         	For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
         	Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
         	He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
         	With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
         	Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
         	Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
         	This royal throne of kings, this sceptered isle,
         	This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
         	This other Eden, demi-paradise,
         	This fortress built by Nature for herself
         	Against infection and the hand of war,
         	This happy breed of men, this little world,
         	This precious stone set in the silver sea,
         	Which serves it in the office of a wall,
         	Or as a moat defensive to a house,
         	Against the envy of less happier lands,
         	This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
         	This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
         	Feared by their breed and famous by their birth,
         	Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
         	For Christian service and true chivalry,
         	As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
         	Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,
         	This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
         	Dear for her reputation through the world,

         	Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege

         	With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
         	That England, that was wont to conquer others,
         	Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
         	Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,

         DUKE OF YORK	The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
         	For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.
         
         QUEEN	How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?
         
         KING RICHARD 	What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	O how that name befits my composition!
         	Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
         	Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
         	And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
         	For sleeping England long time have I watched;
         	Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
         	The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
         	Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
         	And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:
         	Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
         	Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
         	Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
         	I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Should dying men flatter with those that live?
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	No, no, men living flatter those that die.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.
         
         KING RICHARD 	I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
         	Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.
         	Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
         	Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
         	And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
         	Commitest thy anointed body to the cure
         	Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
         	A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
         	Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;
         	And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
         	The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.
         	O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
         	Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,
         	From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
         	Deposing thee before thou wert possessed,
         	Which art possessed now to depose thyself.
         	Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
         	It were a shame to let this land by lease;
         	But for thy world enjoying but this land,
         	Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
         	Landlord of England art thou now, not king:
         	Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--
         
         KING RICHARD 	         A lunatic lean-witted fool,
         	Presuming on an ague's privilege,
         	Darest with thy frozen admonition
         	Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
         	With fury from his native residence.
         	Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,
         	Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
         	This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
         	Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.
         
         JOHN OF GAUNT	O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
         	For that I was his father Edward's son;
         	That blood already,  the pelican,
         	Hast thou tapped out and drunkenly caroused:
         	My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
         	Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
         	May be a precedent and witness good
         	That thou respectest not spilling Edward's blood:
         	Join with the present sickness that I have;
         	And thy unkindness be  crooked age,
         	To crop at once a too long withered flower.
         	Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
         	These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
         	Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
         	Love they to live that love and honour have.
         
         	[Exit, borne off by his Attendants]
         
         KING RICHARD 	And let them die that age and sullens have;
         	For both hast thou, and both become the grave.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
         	To wayward sickliness and age in him:
         	He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
         	As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
         	As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.
         
         	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND]
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.
         
         KING RICHARD 	What says he?
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	                  Nay, nothing; all is said
         	His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
         	Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
         	Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
         
         KING RICHARD 	The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
         	His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
         	So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
         	We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
         	Which live  venom where no venom else
         	But only they have privilege to live.
         	And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
         	Towards our assistance we do seize to us
         	The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
         	Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possessed.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
         	Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
         	Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment
         	Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
         	Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
         	About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
         	Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
         	Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
         	I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
         	Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
         	In war was never lion raged more fierce,
         	In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
         	Than was that young and princely gentleman.
         	His face thou hast, for even so looked he,
         	Accomplished with the number of thy hours;
         	But when he frowned, it was against the French
         	And not against his friends; his noble hand
         	Did will what he did spend and spent not that
         	Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
         	His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
         	But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
         	O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
         	Or else he never would compare between.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Why, uncle, what's the matter?
         
         DUKE OF YORK	O my liege,
         	Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
         	Not to be pardoned, am content withal.
         	Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
         	The royalties and rights of banished Hereford?
         	Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
         	Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
         	Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
         	Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
         	Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
         	His charters and his customary rights;
         	Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
         	Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
         	But by fair sequence and succession?
         	Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
         	If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,
         	Call in the letters patent that he hath
         	By his attorneys-general to sue
         	His livery, and deny his offered homage,
         	You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
         	You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
         	And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
         	Which honour and allegiance cannot think.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Think what you will, we seize into our hands
         	His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
         	What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;
         	But by bad courses may be understood
         	That their events can never fall out good.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING RICHARD 	Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
         	Bid him repair to us to Ely House
         	To see this business. To-morrow next
         	We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:
         	And we create, in absence of ourself,
         	Our uncle York lord governor of England;
         	For he is just and always loved us well.
         	Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;
         	Be merry, for our time of stay is short
         
         	[Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD , QUEEN, DUKE OF
         	AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, and BAGOT]
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
         
         LORD ROSS	And living too; for now his son is duke.
         
         LORD WILLOUGHBY	Barely in title, not in revenue.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Richly in both, if justice had her right.
         
         LORD ROSS	My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
         	Ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongue.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Nay, speak thy mind; and let him never speak more
         	That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!
         
         LORD WILLOUGHBY	Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
         	If it be so, out with it boldly, man;
         	Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.
         
         LORD ROSS	No good at all that I can do for him;
         	Unless you call it good to pity him,
         	Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
         	In him, a royal prince, and many moe
         	Of noble blood in this declining land.
         	The king is not himself, but basely led
         	By flatterers; and what they will inform,
         	Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
         	That will the king severely prosecute
         	'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.
         
         LORD ROSS	The commons hath he pilled with grievous taxes,
         	And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined
         	For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.
         
         LORD WILLOUGHBY	And daily new exactions are devised,
         	As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:
         	But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Wars have not wasted it, for warred he hath not,
         	But basely yielded upon compromise
         	That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
         	More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
         
         LORD ROSS	The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
         
         LORD WILLOUGHBY	The king's grown bankrupt,  a broken man.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
         
         LORD ROSS	He hath not money for these Irish wars,
         	His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,
         	But by the robbing of the banished duke.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
         	But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
         	Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;
         	We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
         	And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
         
         LORD ROSS	We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
         	And unavoided is the danger now,
         	For suffering so the causes of our wreck.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
         	I spy life peering; but I dare not say
         	How near the tidings of our comfort is.
         
         LORD WILLOUGHBY	Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.
         
         LORD ROSS	Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
         	We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,
         	Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
         	In Brittany, received intelligence
         	That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
         	[                                               ]
         	That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
         	His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
         	Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
         	Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
         	All these well furnished by the Duke of Bretagne
         	With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
         	Are making hither with all due expedience
         	And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
         	Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
         	The first departing of the king for Ireland.
         	If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
         	Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
         	Redeem from broking pawn the blemished crown,
         	Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
         	And make high majesty look  itself,
         	Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
         	But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
         	Stay and be secret, and myself will go.
         
         LORD ROSS	To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.
         
         LORD WILLOUGHBY	Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         
         
         
         	KING RICHARD 
         
         
         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The palace.
         
         
         	[Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT]
         
         BUSHY	Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
         	You promised, when you parted with the king,
         	To lay aside life-harming heaviness
         	And entertain a cheerful disposition.
         
         QUEEN	To please the king I did; to please myself
         	I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
         	Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
         	Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
         	As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,
         	Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
         	Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
         	With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
         	More than with parting from my lord the king.
         
         BUSHY	Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
         	Which shows  grief itself, but is not so;
         	For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
         	Divides one thing entire to many objects;
         	 perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
         	Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
         	Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
         	Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
         	Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
         	Which, looked on as it is, is nought but shadows
         	Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
         	More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
         	Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
         	Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
         
         QUEEN	It may be so; but yet my inward soul
         	Persuades me it is otherwise: however it be,
         	I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
         	As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
         	Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
         
         BUSHY	'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
         
         QUEEN	'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
         	From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
         	For nothing had begot my something grief;
         	Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
         	'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
         	But what it is, that is not yet known; what
         	I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.
         
         	[Enter GREEN]
         
         GREEN	God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
         	I hope the king is not yet shipped for Ireland.
         
         QUEEN	Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
         	For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
         	Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipped?
         
         GREEN	That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
         	And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
         	Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
         	The banished Bolingbroke repeals himself,
         	And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
         	At Ravenspurgh.
         
         QUEEN	                  Now God in heaven forbid!
         
         GREEN	Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
         	The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
         	The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
         	With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.
         
         BUSHY	Why have you not proclaimed Northumberland
         	And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
         
         GREEN	We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
         	Hath broke his staff, resigned his stewardship,
         	And all the household servants fled with him
         	To Bolingbroke.
         
         QUEEN	So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
         	And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
         	Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
         	And I, a gasping new-delivered mother,
         	Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow joined.
         
         BUSHY	Despair not, madam.
         
         QUEEN	Who shall hinder me?
         	I will despair, and be at enmity
         	With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
         	A parasite, a keeper back of death,
         	Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
         	Which false hope lingers in extremity.
         
         	[Enter DUKE OF YORK]
         
         GREEN	Here comes the Duke of York.
         
         QUEEN	With signs of war about his aged neck:
         	O, full of careful business are his looks!
         	Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
         	Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
         	Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
         	Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
         	Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
         	Here am I left to underprop his land,
         	Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
         	Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
         	Now shall he try his friends that flattered him.
         
         	[Enter a Servant]
         
         Servant	My lord, your son was gone before I came.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
         	The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,
         	And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
         	Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;
         	Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
         	Hold, take my ring.
         
         Servant	My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
         	To-day, as I came by, I called there;
         	But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	What is't, knave?
         
         Servant	An hour before I came, the duchess died.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
         	Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
         	I know not what to do: I would to God,
         	So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
         	The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
         	What, are there no posts dispatched for Ireland?
         	How shall we do for money for these wars?
         	Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.
         	Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
         	And bring away the armour that is there.
         
         	[Exit Servant]
         
         	Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
         	If I know how or which way to order these affairs
         	Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
         	Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
         	The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
         	And duty bids defend; the other again
         	Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wronged,
         	Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
         	Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
         	Dispose of you.
         	Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
         	And meet me presently at Berkeley.
         	I should to Plashy too;
         	But time will not permit: all is uneven,
         	And every thing is left at six and seven.
         
         	[Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN]
         
         BUSHY	The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
         	But none returns. For us to levy power
         	Proportionable to the enemy
         	Is all unpossible.
         
         GREEN	Besides, our nearness to the king in love
         	Is near the hate of those love not the king.
         
         BAGOT	And that's the wavering commons: for their love
         	Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
         	By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
         
         BUSHY	Wherein the king stands generally condemned.
         
         BAGOT	If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
         	Because we ever have been near the king.
         
         GREEN	Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
         	The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
         
         BUSHY	Thither will I with you; for little office
         	The hateful commons will perform for us,
         	Except  curs to tear us all to pieces.
         	Will you go along with us?
         
         BAGOT	No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
         	Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
         	We three here art that never shall meet again.
         
         BUSHY	That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
         
         GREEN	Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
         	Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
         	Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
         	Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.
         
         BUSHY	Well, we may meet again.
         
         BAGOT	I fear me, never.

         	[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, with Forces]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Believe me, noble lord,
         	I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
         	These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
         	Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,
         	And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
         	Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
         	But I bethink me what a weary way
         	From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
         	In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
         	Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
         	The tediousness and process of my travel:
         	But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
         	The present benefit which I possess;
         	And hope to joy is little less in joy
         	Than hope enjoyed: by this the weary lords
         	Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
         	By sight of what I have, your noble company.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Of much less value is my company
         	Than your good words. But who comes here?
         
         	[Enter HENRY PERCY]
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	It is my son, young Harry Percy,
         	Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
         	Harry, how fares your uncle?
         
         HENRY PERCY	I had thought, my lord, to have learned his health of you.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, is he not with the queen?
         
         HENRY PERCY	No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
         	Broken his staff of office and dispersed
         	The household of the king.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	What was his reason?
         	He was not so resolved when last we spake together.
         
         HENRY PERCY	Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
         	But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
         	To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
         	And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
         	What power the Duke of York had levied there;
         	Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
         
         HENRY PERCY	No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
         	Which never I did remember: to my knowledge,
         	I never in my life did look on him.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.
         
         HENRY PERCY	My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
         	Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:
         	Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
         	To more approved service and desert.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
         	I count myself in nothing else so happy
         	As in a soul remembering my good friends;
         	And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,
         	It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
         	My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
         	Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
         
         HENRY PERCY	There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
         	Manned with three hundred men, as I have heard;
         	And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
         	None else of name and noble estimate.
         
         	[Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY]
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
         	Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
         	A banished traitor: all my treasury
         	Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enriched
         	Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
         
         LORD ROSS	Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
         
         LORD WILLOUGHBY	And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
         	Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
         	Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?
         
         	[Enter LORD BERKELEY]
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
         
         LORD BERKELEY	My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
         	And I am come to seek that name in England;
         	And I must find that title in your tongue,
         	Before I make reply to aught you say.
         
         LORD BERKELEY	Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
         	To raze one title of your honour out:
         	To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
         	From the most gracious regent of this land,
         	The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
         	To take advantage of the absent time
         	And fright our native peace with self-born arms.
         
         	[Enter DUKE OF YORK attended]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I shall not need transport my words by you;
         	Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!
         
         	[Kneels]
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
         	Whose duty is deceiveable and false.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious uncle--
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Tut, tut!
         	Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
         	I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
         	In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
         	Why have those banished and forbidden legs
         	Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
         	But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
         	So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
         	Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
         	And ostentation of despised arms?
         	Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
         	Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
         	And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
         	Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
         	As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
         	Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
         	From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
         	O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
         	Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
         	And minister correction to thy fault!
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
         	On what condition stands it and wherein?
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Even in condition of the worst degree,
         	In gross rebellion and detested treason:
         	Thou art a banished man, and here art come
         	Before the expiration of thy time,
         	In braving arms against thy sovereign.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	As I was banished, I was banished Hereford;
         	But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
         	And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
         	Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
         	You are my father, for methinks in you
         	I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
         	Will you permit that I shall stand condemned
         	A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
         	Plucked from my arms perforce and given away
         	To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
         	If that my cousin king be King of England,
         	It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
         	You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
         	Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
         	He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
         	To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
         	I am denied to sue my livery here,
         	And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
         	My father's goods are all distrained and sold,
         	And these and all are all amiss employed.
         	What would you have me do? I am a subject,
         	And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
         	And therefore, personally I lay my claim
         	To my inheritance of free descent.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	The noble duke hath been too much abused.
         
         LORD ROSS	It stands your grace upon to do him right.
         
         LORD WILLOUGHBY	Base men by his endowments are made great.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	My lords of England, let me tell you this:
         	I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
         	And laboured all I could to do him right;
         	But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
         	Be his own carver and cut out his way,
         	To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
         	And you that do abet him in this kind
         	Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
         	But for his own; and for the right of that
         	We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
         	And let him never see joy that breaks that oath!
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
         	I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
         	Because my power is weak and all ill left:
         	But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
         	I would attach you all and make you stoop
         	Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
         	But since I cannot, be it known to you
         	I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
         	Unless you please to enter in the castle
         	And there repose you for this night.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
         	But we must win your grace to go with us
         	To Bristol castle, which they say is held
         	By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
         	The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
         	Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
         	For I am loath to break our country's laws.
         	Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:

         	From off my hands, here in the view of men
         	I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
         	You have misled a prince, a royal king,
         	A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
         	By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
         	You have in manner with your sinful hours
         	Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
         	Broke the possession of a royal bed
         	And stained the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
         	With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
         	Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
         	Near to the king in blood, and near in love
         	Till you did make him misinterpret me,
         	Have stooped my neck under your injuries,
         	And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds,
         	Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
         	Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
         	Disparked my parks and felled my forest woods,
         	From my own windows torn my household coat,
         	Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
         	Save men's opinions and my living blood,
         	To show the world I am a gentleman.
         	This and much more, much more than twice all this,
         	Condemns you to the death. See them delivered over
         	To execution and the hand of death.
         
         BUSHY	More welcome is the stroke of death to me
         	Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.
         
         GREEN	My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
         	And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatched.
         
         	[Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND and others, with the
         	prisoners]
         
         	Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;
         	For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:
         	Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
         	Take special care my greetings be delivered.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	A gentleman of mine I have dispatched
         	With letters of your love to her at large.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
         	To fight with Glendower and his complices:
         	Awhile to work, and after holiday.

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The coast of Wales. A castle in view.
         
         
         	[Drums; flourish and colours. Enter KING RICHARD
         	, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, and Soldiers]
         
         KING RICHARD 	Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
         	After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
         
         KING RICHARD 	Needs must I  it well: I weep for joy
         	To stand upon my kingdom once again.
         	Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
         	Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
         	As a long-parted mother with her child
         	Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
         	So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
         	And do thee favours with my royal hands.
         	Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
         	Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
         	But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
         	And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
         	Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
         	Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
         	Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
         	And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
         	Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
         	Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
         	Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
         	Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
         	This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
         	Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
         	Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
         
         BISHOP OF CARLISLE	Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
         	Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
         	The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
         	And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
         	And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
         	The proffered means of succor and redress.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
         	Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
         	Grows strong and great in substance and in power.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Discomfortable cousin! knowest thou not
         	That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
         	Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
         	Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
         	In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
         	But when from under this terrestrial ball
         	He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
         	And darts his light through every guilty hole,
         	Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
         	The cloak of night being plucked from off their backs,
         	Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
         	So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
         	Who all this while hath revelled in the night
         	Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
         	Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
         	His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
         	Not able to endure the sight of day,
         	But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
         	Not all the water in the rough rude sea
         	Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
         	The breath of worldly men cannot depose
         	The deputy elected by the Lord:
         	For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed
         	To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
         	God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
         	A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
         	Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
         
         	[Enter EARL OF SALISBURY]
         
         	Welcome, my lord	how far off lies your power?
         
         EARL OF SALISBURY	Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
         	Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
         	And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
         	One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
         	Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
         	O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
         	And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
         	To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
         	Overthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
         	For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
         	Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
         
         KING RICHARD 	But now the blood of twenty thousand men
         	Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
         	And, till so much blood thither come again,
         	Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
         	All souls that will be safe fly from my side,
         	For time hath set a blot upon my pride.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
         
         KING RICHARD 	I had forgot myself; am I not king?
         	Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
         	Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
         	Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
         	At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
         	Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
         	High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
         	Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?
         
         	[Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP]
         
         SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	More health and happiness betide my liege
         	Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!
         
         KING RICHARD 	Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
         	The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
         	Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
         	And what loss is it to be rid of care?
         	Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
         	Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
         	We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
         	Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
         	They break their faith to God as well as us:
         	Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
         	The worst is death, and death will have his day.
         
         SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Glad am I that your highness is so armed
         	To bear the tidings of calamity.
         	 an unseasonable stormy day,
         	Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
         	As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
         	So high above his limits swells the rage
         	Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
         	With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
         	White-beards have armed their thin and hairless scalps
         	Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
         	Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
         	In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
         	The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
         	Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
         	Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
         	Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
         	And all goes worse than I have power to tell.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Too well, too well thou tellest a tale so ill.
         	Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
         	What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
         	That they have let the dangerous enemy
         	Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
         	If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:
         	I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.
         
         SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
         
         KING RICHARD 	O villains, vipers, damned without redemption!
         	Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
         	Snakes, in my heart-blood warmed, that sting my heart!
         	Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
         	Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
         	Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
         
         SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
         	Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
         	Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
         	With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
         	Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
         	And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
         
         SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Where is the duke my father with his power?
         
         KING RICHARD 	No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
         	Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
         	Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
         	Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
         	Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
         	And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
         	Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
         	Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
         	And nothing can we call our own but death
         	And that small model of the barren earth
         	Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
         	For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
         	And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
         	How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
         	Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
         	Some poisoned by their wives: some sleeping killed;
         	All murdered: for within the hollow crown
         	That rounds the mortal temples of a king
         	Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
         	Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
         	Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
         	To monarchize, be feared and kill with looks,
         	Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
         	As if this flesh which walls about our life,
         	Were brass impregnable, and humoured thus
         	Comes at the last and with a little pin
         	Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
         	Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
         	With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
         	Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
         	For you have but mistook me all this while:
         	I live with bread  you, feel want,
         	Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
         	How can you say to me, I am a king?
         
         BISHOP OF CARLISLE	My lord, wise men never sit and wail their woes,
         	But presently prevent the ways to wail.
         	To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
         	Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
         	And so your follies fight against yourself.
         	Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
         	And fight and die is death destroying death;
         	Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	My father hath a power; inquire of him
         	And learn to make a body of a limb.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
         	To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
         	This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
         	An easy task it is to win our own.
         	Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
         	Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.
         
         SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Men judge by the complexion of the sky
         	The state and inclination of the day:
         	So may you by my dull and heavy eye,
         	My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
         	I play the torturer, by small and small
         	To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
         	Your uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke,
         	And all your northern castles yielded up,
         	And all your southern gentlemen in arms
         	Upon his party.
         
         KING RICHARD 	                  Thou hast said enough.
         	Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
         
         	[To DUKE OF AUMERLE]
         
         	Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
         	What say you now? what comfort have we now?
         	By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
         	That bids me be of comfort any more.
         	Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
         	A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
         	That power I have, discharge; and let them go
         	To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
         	For I have none: let no man speak again
         	To alter this, for counsel is but vain.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	My liege, one word.
         
         KING RICHARD 	He does me double wrong
         	That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
         	Discharge my followers: let them hence away,
         	From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.

         	[Enter, with drum and colours, HENRY BOLINGBROKE,
         	DUKE OF YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, Attendants, and forces]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	So that by this intelligence we learn
         	The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
         	Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
         	With some few private friends upon this coast.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	The news is very fair and good, my lord:
         	Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
         	To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day
         	When such a sacred king should hide his head.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
         	Left I his title out.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	The time hath been,
         	Would you have been so brief with him, he would
         	Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,
         	For taking so the head, your whole head's length.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
         	Lest you mistake the heavens are over our heads.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
         	Against their will. But who comes here?
         
         	[Enter HENRY PERCY]
         
         	Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?
         
         HENRY PERCY	The castle royally is manned, my lord,
         	Against thy entrance.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Royally!
         	Why, it contains no king?
         
         HENRY PERCY	Yes, my good lord,
         	It doth contain a king; King Richard lies
         	Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
         	And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
         	Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
         	Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	O, be it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Noble lords,
         	Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
         	Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
         	Into his ruined ears, and thus deliver:
         	Henry Bolingbroke
         	On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
         	And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
         	To his most royal person, hither come
         	Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
         	Provided that my banishment repealed
         	And lands restored again be freely granted:
         	If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
         	And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
         	Rained from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen:
         	The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
         	It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
         	The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
         	My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
         	Go, signify as much, while here we march
         	Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
         	Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,
         	That from this castle's tattered battlements
         	Our fair appointments may be well perused.
         	Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
         	With no less terror than the elements
         	Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
         	At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
         	Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
         	The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
         	My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
         	March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
         
         	[Parle without, and answer within. Then a flourish.

         	EARL OF SALISBURY]
         
         	See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
         	As doth the blushing discontented sun
         	From out the fiery portal of the east,
         	When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
         	To dim his glory and to stain the track
         	Of his bright passage to the occident.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Yet looks he  a king: behold, his eye,
         	As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
         	Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,
         	That any harm should stain so fair a show!
         
         KING RICHARD 	We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
         	To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
         
         	[To NORTHUMBERLAND]
         
         	Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
         	And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
         	To pay their awful duty to our presence?
         	If we be not, show us the hand of God
         	That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
         	For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
         	Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
         	Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
         	And though you think that all, as you have done,
         	Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
         	And we are barren and bereft of friends;
         	Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
         	Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
         	Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
         	Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
         	That lift your vassal hands against my head
         	And threat the glory of my precious crown.
         	Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
         	That every stride he makes upon my land
         	Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
         	The purple testament of bleeding war;
         	But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
         	Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
         	Shall ill become the flower of England's face,
         	Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
         	To scarlet indignation and bedew
         	Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
         	Should so with civil and uncivil arms
         	Be rushed upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
         	Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
         	And by the honourable tomb he swears,
         	That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
         	And by the royalties of both your bloods,
         	Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
         	And by the buried hand of war Gaunt,
         	And by the worth and honour of himself,
         	Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
         	His coming hither hath no further scope
         	Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
         	Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:
         	Which on thy royal party granted once,
         	His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
         	His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
         	To faithful service of your majesty.
         	This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;
         	And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
         	His noble cousin is right welcome hither;
         	And all the number of his fair demands
         	Shall be accomplished without contradiction:
         	With all the gracious utterance thou hast
         	Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
         	We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
         
         	[To DUKE OF AUMERLE]
         
         	To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
         	Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
         	Defiance to the traitor, and so die?
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
         	Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
         
         KING RICHARD 	O God, O God! that ever this tongue of mine,
         	That laid the sentence of dread banishment
         	On yon proud man, should take it off again
         	With words of sooth! O that I were as great
         	As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
         	Or that I could forget what I have been,
         	Or not remember what I must be now!
         	Swellest thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
         	Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
         
         KING RICHARD 	What must the king do now? must he submit?
         	The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
         	The king shall be contented: must he lose
         	The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:
         	I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
         	My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
         	My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
         	My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
         	My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
         	My subjects for a pair of carved saints
         	And my large kingdom for a little grave,
         	A little little grave, an obscure grave;
         	Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,
         	Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
         	May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
         	For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
         	And buried once, why not upon my head?
         	Aumerle, thou weepest, my tender-hearted cousin!
         	We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
         	Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
         	And make a dearth in this revolting land.
         	Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
         	And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
         	As thus, to drop them still upon one place,
         	Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
         	Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
         	Two kinsmen digged their graves with weeping eyes.
         	Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
         	I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
         	Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
         	What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
         	Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
         	You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord, in the base court he doth attend
         	To speak with you; may it please you to come down.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Down, down I come;  glistering Phaethon,
         	Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
         	In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
         	To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
         	In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
         	down, king!
         	For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
         	should sing.
         
         	[Exeunt from above]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What says his majesty?
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Sorrow and grief of heart
         	Makes him speak fondly,  a frantic man
         	Yet he is come.
         
         	[Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Stand all apart,
         	And show fair duty to his majesty.
         
         	[He kneels down]
         
         	My gracious lord,--
         
         KING RICHARD 	Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
         	To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
         	Me rather had my heart might feel your love
         	Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
         	Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
         	Thus high at least, although your knee be low.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
         	As my true service shall deserve your love.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,
         	That know the strongest and surest way to get.
         	Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
         	Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
         	Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
         	Though you are old enough to be my heir.
         	What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;
         	For do we must what force will have us do.
         	Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Yea, my good lord.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Then I must not say no.
         
         	[Flourish. Exeunt]

         SCENE 	LANGLEY. The DUKE OF YORK's garden.
         
         
         	[Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies]
         
         QUEEN	What sport shall we devise here in this garden,
         	To drive away the heavy thought of care?
         
         Lady	Madam, we'll play at bowls.
         
         QUEEN	'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
         	And that my fortune rubs against the bias.
         
         Lady	Madam, we'll dance.
         
         QUEEN	My legs can keep no measure in delight,
         	When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
         	Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.
         
         Lady	Madam, we'll tell tales.
         
         QUEEN	Of sorrow or of joy?
         
         Lady	Of either, madam.
         
         QUEEN	Of neither, girl:
         	For of joy, being altogether wanting,
         	It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
         	Or if of grief, being altogether had,
         	It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
         	For what I have I need not to repeat;
         	And what I want it boots not to complain.
         
         Lady	Madam, I'll sing.
         
         QUEEN	'Tis well that thou hast cause
         	But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.
         
         Lady	I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
         
         QUEEN	And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
         	And never borrow any tear of thee.
         
         	[Enter a Gardener, and two Servants]
         
         	But stay, here come the gardeners:
         	Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
         	My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
         	They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
         	Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.
         
         	[QUEEN and Ladies retire]
         
         Gardener	Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
         	Which,  unruly children, make their sire
         	Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
         	Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
         	Go thou, and  an executioner,
         	Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
         	That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
         	All must be even in our government.
         	You thus employed, I will go root away
         	The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
         	The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.
         
         Servant	Why should we in the compass of a pale
         	Keep law and form and due proportion,
         	Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
         	When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
         	Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
         	Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruined,
         	Her knots disordered and her wholesome herbs
         	Swarming with caterpillars?
         
         Gardener	Hold thy peace:
         	He that hath suffered this disordered spring
         	Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
         	The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
         	That seemed in eating him to hold him up,
         	Are plucked up root and all by Bolingbroke,
         	I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
         
         Servant	What, are they dead?
         
         Gardener	They are; and Bolingbroke
         	Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
         	That he had not so trimmed and dressed his land
         	As we this garden! We at time of year
         	Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
         	Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
         	With too much riches it confound itself:
         	Had he done so to great and growing men,
         	They might have lived to bear and he to taste
         	Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
         	We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
         	Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
         	Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.
         
         Servant	What, think you then the king shall be deposed?
         
         Gardener	Depressed he is already, and deposed
         	'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
         	To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,
         	That tell black tidings.
         
         QUEEN	O, I am pressed to death through want of speaking!
         
         	[Coming forward]
         
         	Thou, old Adam's ness, set to dress this garden,
         	How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
         	What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
         	To make a second fall of cursed man?
         	Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
         	Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
         	Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
         	Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.
         
         Gardener	Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
         	To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
         	King Richard, he is in the mighty hold
         	Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weighed:
         	In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
         	And some few vanities that make him light;
         	But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
         	Besides himself, are all the English peers,
         	And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
         	Post you to London, and you will find it so;
         	I speak no more than every one doth know.
         
         QUEEN	Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
         	Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
         	And am I last that knows it? O, thou thinkest
         	To serve me last, that I may longest keep
         	Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,
         	To meet at London London's king in woe.
         	What, was I born to this, that my sad look
         	Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
         	Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,
         	Pray God the plants thou graftest may never grow.
         
         	[Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies]
         
         GARDENER	Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
         	I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
         	Here did she fall a tear; here in this place
         	I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
         	Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,
         	In the remembrance of a weeping queen.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         	[Enter, as to the Parliament, HENRY BOLINGBROKE,
         	DUKE OF AUMERLE, NORTHUMBERLAND, HENRY PERCY, LORD
         	FITZWATER, DUKE OF SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE,
         	the Abbot Of Westminster, and another Lord, Herald,
         	Officers, and BAGOT]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Call forth Bagot.
         	Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
         	What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
         	Who wrought it with the king, and who performed
         	The bloody office of his timeless end.
         
         BAGOT	Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
         
         BAGOT	My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
         	Scorns to unsay what once it hath delivered.
         	In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
         	I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
         	That reacheth from the restful English court
         	As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
         	Amongst much other talk, that very time,
         	I heard you say that you had rather refuse
         	The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
         	Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
         	Adding withal how blest this land would be
         	In this your cousin's death.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Princes and noble lords,
         	What answer shall I make to this base man?
         	Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
         	On equal terms to give him chastisement?
         	Either I must, or have mine honour soiled
         	With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
         	There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
         	That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,
         	And will maintain what thou hast said is false
         	In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
         	To stain the temper of my knightly sword.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Excepting one, I would he were the best
         	In all this presence that hath moved me so.
         
         LORD FITZWATER	If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
         	There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
         	By that fair sun which shows me where thou standest,
         	I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
         	That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
         	If thou denyest it twenty times, thou liest;
         	And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
         	Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.
         
         LORD FITZWATER	Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Fitzwater, thou art damned to hell for this.
         
         HENRY PERCY	Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
         	In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
         	And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
         	To prove it on thee to the extremest point
         	Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	An if I do not, may my hands rot off
         	And never brandish more revengeful steel
         	Over the glittering helmet of my foe!
         
         Lord	I task the earth to the , forsworn Aumerle;
         	And spur thee on with full as many lies
         	As may be holloaed in thy treacherous ear
         	From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
         	Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
         	I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
         	To answer twenty thousand such as you.
         
         DUKE OF SURREY	My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
         	The very time Aumerle and you did talk.
         
         LORD FITZWATER	'Tis very true: you were in presence then;
         	And you can witness with me this is true.
         
         DUKE OF SURREY	As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
         
         LORD FITZWATER	Surrey, thou liest.
         
         DUKE OF SURREY	Dishonourable boy!
         	That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
         	That it shall render vengeance and revenge
         	Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
         	In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
         	In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
         	Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
         
         LORD FITZWATER	How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
         	If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
         	I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
         	And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,
         	And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,
         	To tie thee to my strong correction.
         	As I intend to thrive in this new world,
         	Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
         	Besides, I heard the banished Norfolk say
         	That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
         	To execute the noble duke at Calais.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
         	That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
         	If he may be repealed, to try his honour.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	These differences shall all rest under gage
         	Till Norfolk be repealed: repealed he shall be,
         	And, though mine enemy, restored again
         	To all his lands and signories: when he's returned,
         	Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.
         
         BISHOP OF CARLISLE	That honourable day shall never be seen.
         	Many a time hath banished Norfolk fought
         	For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
         	Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
         	Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
         	And toiled with works of war, retired himself
         	To Italy; and there at Venice gave
         	His body to that pleasant country's earth,
         	And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
         	Under whose colours he had fought so long.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?
         
         BISHOP OF CARLISLE	As surely as I live, my lord.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
         	Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
         	Your differences shall all rest under gage
         	Till we assign you to your days of trial.
         
         	[Enter DUKE OF YORK, attended]
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
         	From plume-plucked Richard; who with willing soul
         	Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
         	To the possession of thy royal hand:
         	Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
         	And long live Henry, fourth of that name!
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
         
         BISHOP OF CARLISLE	Marry. God forbid!
         	Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
         	Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
         	Would God that any in this noble presence
         	Were enough noble to be upright judge
         	Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
         	Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
         	What subject can give sentence on his king?
         	And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
         	Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
         	Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
         	And shall the figure of God's majesty,
         	His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
         	Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
         	Be judged by subject and inferior breath,
         	And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
         	That in a Christian climate souls refined
         	Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
         	I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
         	Stirred up by God, thus boldly for his king:
         	My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
         	Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
         	And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
         	The blood of English shall manure the ground,
         	And future ages groan for this foul act;
         	Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
         	And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
         	Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
         	Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
         	Shall here inhabit, and this land be called
         	The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
         	O, if you raise this house against this house,
         	It will the woefullest division prove
         	That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
         	Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
         	Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
         	Of capital treason we arrest you here.
         	My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
         	To keep him safely till his day of trial.
         	May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
         	He may surrender; so we shall proceed
         	Without suspicion.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	                  I will be his conduct.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
         	Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
         	Little are we beholding to your love,
         	And little looked for at your helping hands.
         
         	[Re-enter DUKE OF YORK, with KING RICHARD , and
         	Officers bearing the regalia]
         
         KING RICHARD 	Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
         	Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
         	Wherewith I reigned? I hardly yet have learned
         	To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
         	Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
         	To this submission. Yet I well remember
         	The favours of these men: were they not mine?
         	Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
         	So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,
         	Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.
         	God save the king! Will no man say amen?
         	Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
         	God save the king! although I be not he;
         	And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
         	To do what service am I sent for hither?
         
         DUKE OF YORK	To do that office of thine own good will
         	Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
         	The resignation of thy state and crown
         	To Henry Bolingbroke.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
         	Here cousin:
         	On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
         	Now is this golden crown  a deep well
         	That owes two buckets, filling one another,
         	The emptier ever dancing in the air,
         	The other down, unseen and full of water:
         	That bucket down and full of tears am I,
         	Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I thought you had been willing to resign.
         
         KING RICHARD 	My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
         	You may my glories and my state depose,
         	But not my griefs; still am I king of those.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
         	My care is loss of care, by old care done;
         	Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
         	The cares I give I have, though given away;
         	They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Are you contented to resign the crown?
         
         KING RICHARD 	Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
         	Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
         	Now mark me, how I will undo myself;
         	I give this heavy weight from off my head
         	And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
         	The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
         	With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
         	With mine own hands I give away my crown,
         	With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
         	With mine own breath release all duty's rites:
         	All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
         	My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
         	My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
         	God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
         	God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
         	Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
         	And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
         	Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
         	And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!
         	God save King Harry, unkinged Richard says,
         	And send him many years of sunshine days!
         	What more remains?
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	                  No more, but that you read
         	These accusations and these grievous crimes
         	Committed by your person and your followers
         	Against the state and profit of this land;
         	That, by confessing them, the souls of men
         	May deem that you are worthily deposed.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Must I do so? and must I ravel out
         	My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
         	If thy offences were upon record,
         	Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
         	To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
         	There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
         	Containing the deposing of a king
         	And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
         	Marked with a blot, damned in the book of heaven:
         	Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
         	Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
         	Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
         	Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
         	Have here delivered me to my sour cross,
         	And water cannot wash away your sin.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord, dispatch; read over these articles.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:
         	And yet salt water blinds them not so much
         	But they can see a sort of traitors here.
         	Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
         	I find myself a traitor with the rest;
         	For I have given here my soul's consent
         	To undeck the pompous body of a king;
         	Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
         	Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord,--
         
         KING RICHARD 	No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
         	Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,
         	No, not that name was given me at the font,
         	But 'tis usurped: alack the heavy day,
         	That I have worn so many winters out,
         	And know not now what name to call myself!
         	O that I were a mockery king of snow,
         	Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,
         	To melt myself away in water-drops!
         	Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
         	An if my word be sterling yet in England,
         	Let it command a mirror hither straight,
         	That it may show me what a face I have,
         	Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
         
         	[Exit an attendant]
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	Read over this paper while the glass doth come.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Fiend, thou tormentest me ere I come to hell!
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	The commons will not then be satisfied.
         
         KING RICHARD 	They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,
         	When I do see the very book indeed
         	Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.
         
         	[Re-enter Attendant, with a glass]
         
         	Give me the glass, and therein will I read.
         	No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
         	So many blows upon this face of mine,
         	And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
         	 to my followers in prosperity,
         	Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
         	That every day under his household roof
         	Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
         	That,  the sun, did make beholders wink?
         	Was this the face that faced so many follies,
         	And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
         	A brittle glory shineth in this face:
         	As brittle as the glory is the face;
         
         	[Dashes the glass against the ground]
         
         	For there it is, cracked in a hundred shivers.
         	Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,
         	How soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed
         	The shadow or your face.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Say that again.
         	The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
         	'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
         	And these external manners of laments
         	Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
         	That swells with silence in the tortured soul;
         	There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,
         	For thy great bounty, that not only givest
         	Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
         	How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
         	And then be gone and trouble you no more.
         	Shall I obtain it?
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	                  Name it, fair cousin.
         
         KING RICHARD 	'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
         	For when I was a king, my flatterers
         	Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
         	I have a king here to my flatterer.
         	Being so great, I have no need to beg.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Yet ask.
         
         KING RICHARD 	And shall I have?
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	You shall.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Then give me leave to go.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Whither?
         
         KING RICHARD 	Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
         
         KING RICHARD 	O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,
         	That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.
         
         	[Exeunt KING RICHARD , some Lords, and a Guard]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
         	Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.
         
         	[Exeunt all except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the Abbot
         	of Westminster, and DUKE OF AUMERLE]
         
         Abbot	A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
         
         BISHOP OF CARLISLE	The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
         	Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	You holy clergymen, is there no plot
         	To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
         
         Abbot	My lord,
         	Before I freely speak my mind herein,
         	You shall not only take the sacrament
         	To bury mine intents, but also to effect
         	Whatever I shall happen to devise.
         	I see your brows are full of discontent,
         	Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
         	Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay
         	A plot shall show us all a merry day.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         SCENE I	London. A street leading to the Tower.
         
         
         	[Enter QUEEN and Ladies]
         
         QUEEN	This way the king will come; this is the way
         	To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,
         	To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
         	Is doomed a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
         	Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
         	Have any resting for her true king's queen.
         
         	[Enter KING RICHARD  and Guard]
         
         	But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
         	My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
         	That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
         	And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
         	Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
         	Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
         	And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
         	Why should hard-favoured grief be lodged in thee,
         	When triumph is become an alehouse guest?
         
         KING RICHARD 	Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
         	To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
         	To think our former state a happy dream;
         	From which awaked, the truth of what we are
         	Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
         	To grim Necessity, and he and I
         	Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France
         	And cloister thee in some religious house:
         	Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
         	Which our profane hours here have stricken down.
         
         QUEEN	What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
         	Transformed and weakened? hath Bolingbroke deposed
         	Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
         	The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
         	And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
         	To be overpowered; and wilt thou, pupil-,
         	Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
         	And fawn on rage with base humility,
         	Which art a lion and a king of beasts?
         
         KING RICHARD 	A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
         	I had been still a happy king of men.
         	Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
         	Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,
         	As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
         	In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
         	With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
         	Of woeful ages long ago betid;
         	And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
         	Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
         	And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
         	For why, the senseless brands will sympathize
         	The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
         	And in compassion weep the fire out;
         	And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
         	For the deposing of a rightful king.
         
         	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others]
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
         	You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
         	And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;
         	With all swift speed you must away to France.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
         	The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
         	The time shall not be many hours of age
         	More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
         	Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,
         	Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
         	It is too little, helping him to all;
         	And he shall think that thou, which knowest the way
         	To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
         	Being never so little urged, another way
         	To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
         	The love of wicked men converts to fear;
         	That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
         	To worthy danger and deserved death.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
         	Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
         	A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
         	And then betwixt me and my married wife.
         	Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
         	And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
         	Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,
         	Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
         	My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,
         	She came adorned hither  sweet May,
         	Sent back  Hallowmas or shortest of day.
         
         QUEEN	And must we be divided? must we part?
         
         KING RICHARD 	Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
         
         QUEEN	Banish us both and send the king with me.
         
         NORTHUMBERLAND	That were some love but little policy.
         
         QUEEN	Then whither he goes, thither let me go.
         
         KING RICHARD 	So two, together weeping, make one woe.
         	Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;
         	Better far off than near, be never the near.
         	Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
         
         QUEEN	So longest way shall have the longest moans.
         
         KING RICHARD 	Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
         	And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
         	Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
         	Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
         	One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
         	Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.
         
         QUEEN	Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
         	To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
         	So, now I have mine own again, be gone,
         	That I might strive to kill it with a groan.
         
         KING RICHARD 	We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
         	Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT V
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The DUKE OF YORK's palace.
         
         
         	[Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK]
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
         	When weeping made you break the story off,
         	of our two cousins coming into London.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Where did I leave?
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	                  At that sad stop, my lord,
         	Where rude misgoverned hands from windows' tops
         	Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
         	Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
         	Which his aspiring rider seemed to know,
         	With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
         	Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
         	Bolingbroke!'
         	You would have thought the very windows spake,
         	So many greedy looks of young and old
         	Through casements darted their desiring eyes
         	Upon his visage, and that all the walls
         	With painted imagery had said at once
         	'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
         	Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
         	Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
         	Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
         	And thus still doing, thus he passed along.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
         
         DUKE OF YORK	As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
         	After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
         	Are idly bent on him that enters next,
         	Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
         	Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
         	Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
         	No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
         	But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
         	Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
         	His face still combating with tears and smiles,
         	The badges of his grief and patience,
         	That had not God, for some strong purpose, steeled
         	The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
         	And barbarism itself have pitied him.
         	But heaven hath a hand in these events,
         	To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
         	To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
         	Whose state and honour I for aye allow.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Here comes my son Aumerle.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Aumerle that was;
         	But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
         	And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
         	I am in parliament pledge for his truth
         	And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
         
         	[Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE]
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
         	That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
         	God knows I had as lief be none as one.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
         	Lest you be cropped before you come to prime.
         	What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	For aught I know, my lord, they do.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	You will be there, I know.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	If God prevent not, I purpose so.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
         	Yea, lookest thou pale? let me see the writing.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	My lord, 'tis nothing.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	No matter, then, who see it;
         	I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
         	It is a matter of small consequence,
         	Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
         	I fear, I fear,--
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	                  What should you fear?
         	'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is entered into
         	For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
         	That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
         	Boy, let me see the writing.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
         
         	[He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it]
         
         	Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	What is the matter, my lord?
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Ho! who is within there?
         
         	[Enter a Servant]
         
         		    Saddle my horse.
         	God for his mercy, what treachery is here!
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, what is it, my lord?
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
         	Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,
         	I will appeach the villain.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	What is the matter?
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Peace, foolish woman.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Good mother, be content; it is no more
         	Than my poor life must answer.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Thy life answer!
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.
         
         	[Re-enter Servant with boots]
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
         	Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Give me my boots, I say.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, York, what wilt thou do?
         	Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
         	Have we more sons? or are we  to have?
         	Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
         	And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
         	And rob me of a happy mother's name?
         	Is he not  thee? is he not thine own?
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Thou fond mad woman,
         	Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
         	A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
         	And interchangeably set down their hands,
         	To kill the king at Oxford.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	He shall be none;
         	We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
         	I would appeach him.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Hadst thou groaned for him
         	As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
         	But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
         	That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
         	And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
         	Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
         	He is as  thee as a man may be,
         	Not  to me, or any of my kin,
         	And yet I love him.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Make way, unruly woman!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
         	Spur post, and get before him to the king,
         	And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
         	I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
         	I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
         	And never will I rise up from the ground
         	Till Bolingbroke have pardoned thee. Away, be gone!
         
         	[Exeunt]

         	[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, HENRY PERCY, and other Lords]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
         	'Tis full three months since I did see him last;
         	If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
         	I would to God, my lords, he might be found:
         	Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,
         	For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
         	With unrestrained loose companions,
         	Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,
         	And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
         	Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
         	Takes on the point of honour to support
         	So dissolute a crew.
         
         HENRY PERCY	My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
         	And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	And what said the gallant?
         
         HENRY PERCY	His answer was, he would unto the stews,
         	And from the commonest creature pluck a glove,
         	And wear it as a favour; and with that
         	He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
         	I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
         	May happily bring forth. But who comes here?
         
         	[Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE]

         	So wildly?
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
         	To have some conference with your grace alone.

         	Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Intended or committed was this fault?
         	If on the first, how heinous ever it be,
         	To win thy after-love I pardon thee.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
         	That no man enter till my tale be done.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Have thy desire.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	[Within]  My liege, beware; look to thyself;

         	[Enter DUKE OF YORK]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What is the matter, uncle? speak;
         	Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
         	That we may arm us to encounter it.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
         	The treason that my haste forbids me show.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Remember, as thou readest, thy promise passed:
         	I do repent me; read not my name there
         	My heart is not confederate with my hand.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
         	I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;
         	Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
         	Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
         	A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
         	O loyal father of a treacherous son!
         	Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
         	From when this stream through muddy passages
         	Hath held his current and defiled himself!
         	Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
         	And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
         	This deadly blot in thy digressing son.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
         	And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
         	As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
         	Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
         	Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
         	Thou killest me in his life; giving him breath,
         	The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	[Within]  What ho, my liege! for God's sake,
         	let me in.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
         	Speak with me, pity me, open the door.
         	A beggar begs that never begged before.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Our scene is altered from a serious thing,
         	And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
         	My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
         	I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
         	More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.
         	This festered joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
         	This let alone will all the rest confound.
         
         	[Enter DUCHESS OF YORK]
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
         	Love loving not itself none other can.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
         	Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.
         
         	[Kneels]
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Rise up, good aunt.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Not yet, I thee beseech:
         	For ever will I walk upon my knees,
         	And never see day that the happy sees,
         	Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,
         	By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.
         
         DUKE OF AUMERLE	Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Against them both my true joints bended be.
         	Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
         	His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
         	His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
         	He prays but faintly and would be denied;
         	We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
         	His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
         	Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
         	His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
         	Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
         	Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have
         	That mercy which true prayer ought to have.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Good aunt, stand up.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Nay, do not say, estand up;'
         	Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards estand up.'
         	And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
         	'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
         	I never longed to hear a word till now;
         	Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
         	The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
         	No word  'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
         
         DUKE OF YORK	Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
         	Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
         	That setest the word itself against the word!
         	Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
         	The chopping French we do not understand.
         	Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
         	Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
         	That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
         	Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Good aunt, stand up.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	I do not sue to stand;
         	Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
         	Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
         	Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
         	But makes one pardon strong.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	With all my heart
         	I pardon him.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	                  A god on earth thou art.
         
         HENRY BOLINGBROKE	But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,
         	With all the rest of that consorted crew,
         	Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
         	Good uncle, help to order several powers
         	To Oxford, or wherever these traitors are:
         	They shall not live within this world, I swear,
         	But I will have them, if I once know where.
         	Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
         	Your mother well hath prayed, and prove you true.
         
         DUCHESS OF YORK	Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.

         SCENE V	Pomfret castle.
         
         
         	[Enter KING RICHARD]
         
         KING RICHARD 	I have been studying how I may compare
         	This prison where I live unto the world:
         	And for because the world is populous
         	And here is not a creature but myself,
         	I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
         	My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
         	My soul the father; and these two beget
         	A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
         	And these same thoughts people this little world,
         	In humours  the people of this world,
         	For no thought is contented. The better sort,
         	As thoughts of things divine, are intermixed
         	With scruples and do set the word itself
         	Against the word:
         	As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
         	'It is as hard to come as for a camel
         	To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
         	Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
         	Unly wonders; how these vain weak nails
         	May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
         	Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
         	And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
         	Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
         	That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
         	Nor shall not be the last;  silly beggars
         	Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
         	That many have and others must sit there;
         	And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
         	Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
         	Of such as have before endured the .
         	Thus play I in one person many people,
         	And none contented: sometimes am I king;
         	Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
         	And so I am: then crushing penury
         	Persuades me I was better when a king;
         	Then am I kinged again: and by and by
         	Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke,
         	And straight am nothing: but whatever I be,
         	Nor I nor any man that but man is
         	With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
         	With being nothing. Music do I hear?
         
         	[Music]
         
         	Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
         	When time is broke and no proportion kept!
         	So is it in the music of men's lives.
         	And here have I the daintiness of ear
         	To cheque time broke in a disordered string;
         	But for the concord of my state and time
         	Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
         	I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
         	For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
         	My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
         	Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
         	Whereto my finger,  a dial's point,
         	Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
         	Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
         	Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
         	Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
         	Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
         	Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
         	While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
         	This music mads me; let it sound no more;
         	For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
         	In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
         	Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
         	For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
         	Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.
         
         	[Enter a Groom of the Stable]
         
         Groom	Hail, royal prince!
         
         KING RICHARD 	Thanks, noble peer;
         	The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
         	What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
         	Where no man never comes but that sad dog
         	That brings me food to make misfortune live?
         
         Groom	I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
         	When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,
         	With much ado at length have gotten leave
         	To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
         	O, how it yearned my heart when I beheld
         	In London streets, that coronation-day,
         	When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
         	That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
         	That horse that I so carefully have dressed!
         
         KING RICHARD 	Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
         	How went he under him?
         
         Groom	So proudly as if he disdained the ground.
         
         KING RICHARD 	So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
         	That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
         	This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
         	Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
         	Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
         	Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
         	Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
         	Since thou, created to be awed by man,
         	Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
         	And yet I bear a burthen  an ass,
         	Spurred, galled and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.

         	[Exit]
         
         Keeper	My lord, will't please you to fall to?
         
         KING RICHARD 	Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.
         
         Keeper	My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
         	lately came from the king, commands the contrary.
         
         KING RICHARD 	The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
         	Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.

         SCENE I	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
         
         
         	[Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,
         	and LAFEU, all in black]
         
         COUNTESS	In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
         
         BERTRAM	And I in going, madam, weep over my father's death
         	anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
         	whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
         
         LAFEU	You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
         	sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
         	good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
         	worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
         	than lack it where there is such abundance.
         
         COUNTESS	What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
         
         LAFEU	He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
         	practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
         	finds no other advantage in the process but only the
         	losing of hope by time.
         
         COUNTESS	This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
         	'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
         	almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
         	far, would have made nature immortal, and death
         	should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
         	king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
         	the death of the king's disease.
         
         LAFEU	How called you the man you speak of, madam?
         
         COUNTESS	He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
         	his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
         
         LAFEU	He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
         	lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
         	was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
         	could be set up against mortality.
         
         BERTRAM	What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
         
         LAFEU	A fistula, my lord.
         
         BERTRAM	I heard not of it before.
         
         LAFEU	I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
         	the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
         
         COUNTESS	His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
         	overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
         	her education promises; her dispositions she
         	inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
         	an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
         	commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
         	traitors too; in her they are the better for their
         	simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
         
         LAFEU	Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
         
         COUNTESS	'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
         	in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
         	her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
         	livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
         	go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
         	a sorrow than have it.
         
         HELENA	I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
         
         LAFEU	Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
         	excessive grief the enemy to the living.
         
         COUNTESS	If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
         	makes it soon mortal.
         
         BERTRAM	Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
         
         LAFEU	How understand we that?
         
         COUNTESS	Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
         	In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
         	Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
         	Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
         	Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
         	Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
         	Under thy own life's key: be chequeed for silence,
         	But never taxed for speech. What heaven more will,
         	That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
         	Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
         	'Tis an unseasoned courtier; good my lord,
         	Advise him.
         
         LAFEU	          He cannot want the best
         	That shall attend his love.
         
         COUNTESS	Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BERTRAM	[To HELENA]  The best wishes that can be forged in
         	your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
         	to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
         
         LAFEU	Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
         	your father.
         
         	[Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU]
         
         HELENA	O, were that all! I think not on my father;
         	And these great tears grace his remembrance more
         	Than those I shed for him. What was he ?
         	I have forgot him: my imagination
         	Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
         	I am undone: there is no living, none,
         	If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
         	That I should love a bright particular star
         	And think to wed it, he is so above me:
         	In his bright radiance and collateral light
         	Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
         	The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
         	The hind that would be mated by the lion
         	Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
         	To see him every hour; to sit and draw
         	His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
         	In our heart's table; heart too capable
         	Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
         	But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
         	Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
         
         	[Enter PAROLLES]
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
         	And yet I know him a notorious liar,
         	Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
         	Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
         	That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
         	Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
         	Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
         
         PAROLLES	Save you, fair queen!
         
         HELENA	And you, monarch!
         
         PAROLLES	No.
         
         HELENA	And no.
         
         PAROLLES	Are you meditating on virginity?
         
         HELENA	Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
         	ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
         	may we barricado it against him?
         
         PAROLLES	Keep him out.
         
         HELENA	But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
         	in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
         	war resistance.
         
         PAROLLES	There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
         	undermine you and blow you up.
         
         HELENA	Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
         	blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
         	virgins might blow up men?
         
         PAROLLES	Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
         	blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
         	the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
         	is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
         	preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
         	increase and there was never virgin got till
         	virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
         	metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
         	may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
         	ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
         
         HELENA	I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
         
         PAROLLES	There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
         	rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
         	is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
         	disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
         	virginity murders itself and should be buried in
         	highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
         	offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
         	much  a cheese; consumes itself to the very
         	paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
         	Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
         	self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
         	canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
         	by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
         	itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
         	principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
         
         HELENA	How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
         
         PAROLLES	Let me see: marry, ill, to  him that never it
         	s. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
         	lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
         	while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
         	Virginity,  an old courtier, wears her cap out
         	of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
         	 the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
         	now. Your date is better in your pie and your
         	porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
         	your old virginity, is  one of our French
         	withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
         	'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
         	marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?
         
         HELENA	Not my virginity yet [         ]
         	There shall your master have a thousand loves,
         	A mother and a mistress and a friend,
         	A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
         	A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
         	A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
         	His humble ambition, proud humility,
         	His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
         	His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
         	Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
         	That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
         	I know not what he shall. God send him well!
         	The court's a learning place, and he is one--
         
         PAROLLES	What one, i' faith?
         
         HELENA	That I wish well. 'Tis pity--
         
         PAROLLES	What's pity?
         
         HELENA	That wishing well had not a body in't,
         	Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
         	Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
         	Might with effects of them follow our friends,
         	And show what we alone must think, which never
         	Return us thanks.

         PAROLLES	Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
         	will think of thee at court.
         
         HELENA	Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
         
         PAROLLES	Under Mars, I.
         
         HELENA	I especially think, under Mars.
         
         PAROLLES	Why under Mars?
         
         HELENA	The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
         	be born under Mars.
         
         PAROLLES	When he was predominant.
         
         HELENA	When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
         
         PAROLLES	Why think you so?
         
         HELENA	You go so much backward when you fight.
         
         PAROLLES	That's for advantage.
         
         HELENA	So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
         	but the composition that your valour and fear makes
         	in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I  the wear well.
         
         PAROLLES	I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
         	acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
         	which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
         	thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
         	counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
         	thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
         	thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
         	thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
         	none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
         	and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.

         	A braving war.
         
         First Lord	                  So 'tis reported, sir.
         
         KING	Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
         	A certainty, vouched from our cousin Austria,
         	With caution that the Florentine will move us
         	For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
         	Prejudicates the business and would seem
         	To have us make denial.

         	For amplest credence.

         	[Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES]
         
         First Lord	It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
         	Young Bertram.
         
         KING	                  Youth, thou bearest thy father's face;
         	Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
         	Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
         	Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
         
         BERTRAM	My thanks and duty are your majesty's.
         
         KING	I would I had that corporal soundness now,
         	As when thy father and myself in friendship
         	First tried our soldiership! He did look far
         	Into the service of the time and was
         	Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
         	But on us both did haggish age steal on
         	And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
         	To talk of your good father. In his youth
         	He had the wit which I can well observe
         	To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
         	Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
         	Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
         	So  a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
         	Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
         	His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
         	Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
         	Exception bid him speak, and at this time
         	His tongue obeyed his hand: who were below him
         	He used as creatures of another place
         	And bowed his eminent top to their low ranks,
         	Making them proud of his humility,
         	In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
         	Might be a copy to these younger times;
         	Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now
         	But goers backward.
         
         BERTRAM	His good remembrance, sir,
         	Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
         	So in approof lives not his epitaph
         	As in your royal speech.
         
         KING	Would I were with him! He would always say--
         	Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
         	He scattered not in ears, but grafted them,
         	To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
         	This his good melancholy oft began,
         	On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
         	When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
         	'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
         	Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
         	All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
         	Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
         	Expire before their fashions.' This he wished;
         	I after him do after him wish too,
         	Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
         	I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
         	To give some labourers room.
         
         Second Lord	You are loved, sir:
         	They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
         
         KING	I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
         	Since the physician at your father's died?
         	He was much famed.
         
         BERTRAM	                  Some six months since, my lord.
         
         KING	If he were living, I would try him yet.
         	Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
         	With several applications; nature and sickness
         	Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
         	My son's no dearer.
         
         BERTRAM	Thank your majesty.

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
         
         
         	[Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown]
         
         COUNTESS	I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
         
         Steward	Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I
         	wish might be found in the calendar of my past
         	endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make
         	foul the clearness of our deservings, when of
         	ourselves we publish them.
         
         COUNTESS	What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
         	the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
         	believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know
         	you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability
         	enough to make such knaveries yours.
         
         Clown	'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
         
         COUNTESS	Well, sir.
         
         Clown	No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though
         	many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have
         	your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel
         	the woman and I will do as we may.
         
         COUNTESS	Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
         
         Clown	I do beg your good will in this case.
         
         COUNTESS	In what case?
         
         Clown	In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
         	heritage: and I think I shall never have the
         	blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for
         	they say barnes are blessings.
         
         COUNTESS	Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
         
         Clown	My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
         	by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
         
         COUNTESS	Is this all your worship's reason?
         
         Clown	Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
         	are.
         
         COUNTESS	May the world know them?
         
         Clown	I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
         	all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry
         	that I may repent.
         
         COUNTESS	Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
         
         Clown	I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have
         	friends for my wife's sake.
         
         COUNTESS	Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
         
         Clown	You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the
         	knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.
         	He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
         	leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my
         	drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
         	of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh
         	and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my
         	flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses
         	my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to
         	be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;
         	for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
         	Papist, howsomever their hearts are severed in
         	religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl
         	horns together,  any deer i' the herd.
         
         COUNTESS	Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?
         
         Clown	A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next
         	way:
         	For I the ballad will repeat,
         	Which men full true shall find;
         	Your marriage comes by destiny,
         	Your cuckoo sings by kind.
         
         COUNTESS	Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.
         
         Steward	May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to
         	you: of her I am to speak.
         
         COUNTESS	Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;
         	Helen, I mean.
         
         Clown	     Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
         	Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
         	Fond done, done fond,
         	Was this King Priam's joy?
         	With that she sighed as she stood,
         	With that she sighed as she stood,
         	And gave this sentence then;
         	Among nine bad if one be good,
         	Among nine bad if one be good,
         	There's yet one good in ten.
         
         COUNTESS	What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.
         
         Clown	One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying
         	o' the song: would God would serve the world so all
         	the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,
         	if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we
         	might have a good woman born but one every blazing
         	star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery
         	well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck
         	one.
         
         COUNTESS	You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.
         
         Clown	That man should be at woman's command, and yet no
         	hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it
         	will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of
         	humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am
         	going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         COUNTESS	Well, now.
         
         Steward	I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
         
         COUNTESS	Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and
         	she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully
         	make title to as much love as she finds: there is
         	more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid
         	her than she'll demand.
         
         Steward	Madam, I was very late more near her than I think
         	she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate
         	to herself her own words to her own ears; she
         	thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any
         	stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:
         	Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put
         	such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no
         	god, that would not extend his might, only where
         	qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that
         	would suffer her poor knight surprised, without
         	rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
         	This she delivered in the most bitter touch of
         	sorrow that ever I heard virgin exclaim in: which I
         	held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;
         	sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns
         	you something to know it.
         
         COUNTESS	You have discharged this honestly; keep it to
         	yourself: many lihoods informed me of this
         	before, which hung so tottering in the balance that
         	I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,
         	leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you
         	for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.
         
         	[Exit Steward]
         
         	[Enter HELENA]
         
         	Even so it was with me when I was young:
         	If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
         	Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
         	Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;
         	It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
         	Where love's strong passion is impressed in youth:
         	By our remembrances of days foregone,
         	Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
         	Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.
         
         HELENA	What is your pleasure, madam?
         
         COUNTESS	You know, Helen,
         	I am a mother to you.
         
         HELENA	Mine honourable mistress.
         
         COUNTESS	Nay, a mother:
         	Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
         	Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'
         	That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
         	And put you in the catalogue of those
         	That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
         	Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
         	A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
         	You never oppressed me with a mother's groan,
         	Yet I express to you a mother's care:
         	God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
         	To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
         	That this distempered messenger of wet,
         	The many-coloured Iris, rounds thine eye?
         	Why? that you are my daughter?
         
         HELENA	That I am not.
         
         COUNTESS	I say, I am your mother.
         
         HELENA	Pardon, madam;
         	The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
         	I am from humble, he from honoured name;
         	No note upon my parents, his all noble:
         	My master, my dear lord he is; and I
         	His servant live, and will his vassal die:
         	He must not be my brother.
         
         COUNTESS	Nor I your mother?
         
         HELENA	You are my mother, madam; would you were,--
         	So that my lord your son were not my brother,--
         	Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
         	I care no more for than I do for heaven,
         	So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
         	But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
         
         COUNTESS	Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
         	God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
         	So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
         	My fear hath catched your fondness: now I see
         	The mystery of your loneliness, and find
         	Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
         	You love my son; invention is ashamed,
         	Against the proclamation of thy passion,
         	To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
         	But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks
         	Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
         	See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
         	That in their kind they speak it: only sin
         	And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
         	That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
         	If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
         	If it be not, forswear't: however, I charge thee,
         	As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
         	Tell me truly.
         
         HELENA	                  Good madam, pardon me!
         
         COUNTESS	Do you love my son?
         
         HELENA	Your pardon, noble mistress!
         
         COUNTESS	Love you my son?
         
         HELENA	                  Do not you love him, madam?
         
         COUNTESS	Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,
         	Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
         	The state of your affection; for your passions
         	Have to the full appeached.
         
         HELENA	Then, I confess,
         	Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
         	That before you, and next unto high heaven,
         	I love your son.
         	My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
         	Be not offended; for it hurts not him
         	That he is loved of me: I follow him not
         	By any token of presumptuous suit;
         	Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
         	Yet never know how that desert should be.
         	I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
         	Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
         	I still pour in the waters of my love
         	And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-,
         	Religious in mine error, I adore
         	The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
         	But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
         	Let not your hate encounter with my love
         	For loving where you do: but if yourself,
         	Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
         	Did ever in so true a flame of liking
         	Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
         	Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
         	To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
         	But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
         	That seeks not to find that her search implies,
         	But riddle- lives sweetly where she dies!
         
         COUNTESS	Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--
         	To go to Paris?
         
         HELENA	                  Madam, I had.
         
         COUNTESS	Wherefore? tell true.
         
         HELENA	I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
         	You know my father left me some prescriptions
         	Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
         	And manifest experience had collected
         	For general sovereignty; and that he willed me
         	In heedfullest reservation to bestow them,
         	As notes whose faculties inclusive were
         	More than they were in note: amongst the rest,
         	There is a remedy, approved, set down,
         	To cure the desperate languishings whereof
         	The king is rendered lost.
         
         COUNTESS	This was your motive
         	For Paris, was it? speak.
         
         HELENA	My lord your son made me to think of this;
         	Else Paris and the medicine and the king
         	Had from the conversation of my thoughts
         	Haply been absent then.
         
         COUNTESS	But think you, Helen,
         	If you should tender your supposed aid,
         	He would receive it? he and his physicians
         	Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
         	They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
         	A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
         	Embowelled of their doctrine, have left off
         	The danger to itself?
         
         HELENA	There's something in't,
         	More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
         	Of his profession, that his good receipt
         	Shall for my legacy be sanctified
         	By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
         	But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
         	The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
         	By such a day and hour.
         
         COUNTESS	Dost thou believe't?
         
         HELENA	Ay, madam, knowingly.
         
         COUNTESS	Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
         	Means and attendants and my loving greetings
         	To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home
         	And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
         	Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
         	What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

         	Florentine war; BERTRAM, and PAROLLES]
         
         KING	Farewell, young lords; these war principles
         	Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
         	Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
         	The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
         	And is enough for both.
         
         First Lord	'Tis our hope, sir,
         	After well entered soldiers, to return
         	And find your grace in health.
         
         KING	No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
         	Will not confess he owes the malady
         	That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
         	Whether I live or die, be you the sons
         	Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--
         	Those bated that inherit but the fall
         	Of the last monarchy,--see that you come
         	Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
         	The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
         	That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.
         
         Second Lord	Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!
         
         KING	Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
         	They say, our French lack language to deny,
         	If they demand: beware of being captives,
         	Before you serve.
         
         Both	                  Our hearts receive your warnings.
         
         KING	Farewell. Come hither to me.
         
         	[Exit, attended]
         
         First Lord	O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
         
         PAROLLES	'Tis not his fault, the spark.
         
         Second Lord	O, 'tis brave wars!
         
         PAROLLES	Most admirable: I have seen those wars.
         
         BERTRAM	I am commanded here, and kept a coil with
         	'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'
         
         PAROLLES	An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.
         
         BERTRAM	I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
         	Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
         	Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
         	But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.
         
         First Lord	There's honour in the theft.
         
         PAROLLES	Commit it, count.
         
         Second Lord	I am your accessary; and so, farewell.
         
         BERTRAM	I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.
         
         First Lord	Farewell, captain.
         
         Second Lord	Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
         
         PAROLLES	Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good
         	sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall
         	find in the regiment of the Spin one Captain
         	Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here
         	on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
         	entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his
         	reports for me.
         
         First Lord	We shall, noble captain.
         
         	[Exeunt Lords]
         
         PAROLLES	Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?
         
         BERTRAM	Stay: the king.
         
         	[Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire]
         
         PAROLLES	[To BERTRAM]  Use a more spacious ceremony to the
         	noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the
         	list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to
         	them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the
         	time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and
         	move under the influence of the most received star;
         	and though the devil lead the measure, such are to
         	be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.
         
         BERTRAM	And I will do so.
         
         PAROLLES	Worthy fellows; and  to prove most sinewy sword-men.
         
         	[Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES]
         
         	[Enter LAFEU]
         
         LAFEU	[Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
         
         KING	I'll fee thee to stand up.
         
         LAFEU	Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
         	I would you had kneeled, my lord, to ask me mercy,
         	And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
         
         KING	I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
         	And asked thee mercy for't.
         
         LAFEU	Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;
         	Will you be cured of your infirmity?
         
         KING	No.
         
         LAFEU	O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
         	Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
         	My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
         	That's able to breathe life into a stone,
         	Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
         	With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
         	Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
         	To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
         	And write to her a love-line.
         
         KING	What 'her' is this?
         
         LAFEU	Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
         	If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
         	If seriously I may convey my thoughts
         	In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
         	With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
         	Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
         	Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
         	For that is her demand, and know her business?
         	That done, laugh well at me.
         
         KING	Now, good Lafeu,
         	Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
         	May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
         	By wondering how thou tookest it.
         
         LAFEU	Nay, I'll fit you,
         	And not be all day neither.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING	Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
         
         	[Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA]
         
         LAFEU	Nay, come your ways.
         
         KING	This haste hath wings indeed.
         
         LAFEU	Nay, come your ways:
         	This is his majesty; say your mind to him:
         	A traitor you do look ; but such traitors
         	His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,
         	That dare leave two together; fare you well.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING	Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
         
         HELENA	Ay, my good lord.
         	Gerard de Narbon was my father;
         	In what he did profess, well found.
         
         KING	I knew him.
         
         HELENA	The rather will I spare my praises towards him:
         	Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
         	Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
         	Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
         	And of his old experience the oily darling,
         	He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
         	Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
         	And hearing your high majesty is touched
         	With that malignant cause wherein the honour
         	Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
         	I come to tender it and my appliance
         	With all bound humbleness.
         
         KING	We thank you, maiden;
         	But may not be so credulous of cure,
         	When our most learned doctors leave us and
         	The congregated college have concluded
         	That labouring art can never ransom nature
         	From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
         	So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
         	To prostitute our past-cure malady
         	To empirics, or to dissever so
         	Our great self and our credit, to esteem
         	A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
         
         HELENA	My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
         	I will no more enforce mine office on you.
         	Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
         	A modest one, to bear me back a again.
         
         KING	I cannot give thee less, to be called grateful:
         	Thou thoughtest to help me; and such thanks I give
         	As one near death to those that wish him live:
         	But what at full I know, thou knowest no part,
         	I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
         
         HELENA	What I can do can do no hurt to try,
         	Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
         	He that of greatest works is finisher
         	Oft does them by the weakest minister:
         	So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
         	When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
         	From simple sources, and great seas have dried
         	When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
         	Oft expectation fails and most oft there
         	Where most it promises, and oft it hits
         	Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.
         
         KING	I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
         	Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
         	Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
         
         HELENA	Inspired merit so by breath is barred:
         	It is not so with Him that all things knows
         	As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
         	But most it is presumption in us when
         	The help of heaven we count the act of men.
         	Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
         	Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
         	I am not an impostor that proclaim
         	Myself against the level of mine aim;
         	But know I think and think I know most sure
         	My art is not past power nor you past cure.
         
         KING	Are thou so confident? within what space
         	Hopest thou my cure?
         
         HELENA	The greatest grace lending grace
         	Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
         	Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
         	Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
         	Moist Hesperus hath quenched his sleepy lamp,
         	Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
         	Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
         	What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
         	Health shall live free and sickness freely die.
         
         KING	Upon thy certainty and confidence
         	What darest thou venture?
         
         HELENA	Tax of impudence,
         	A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame
         	Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
         	Seared otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended
         	With vilest torture let my life be ended.
         
         KING	Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
         	His powerful sound within an organ weak:
         	And what impossibility would slay
         	In common sense, sense saves another way.
         	Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
         	Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,
         	Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
         	That happiness and prime can happy call:
         	Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
         	Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
         	Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
         	That ministers thine own death if I die.
         
         HELENA	If I break time, or flinch in property
         	Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
         	And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;
         	But, if I help, what do you promise me?
         
         KING	Make thy demand.
         
         HELENA	                  But will you make it even?
         
         KING	Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
         
         HELENA	Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
         	What husband in thy power I will command:
         	Exempted be from me the arrogance
         	To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
         	My low and humble name to propagate
         	With any branch or image of thy state;
         	But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
         	Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
         
         KING	Here is my hand; the premises observed,
         	Thy will by my performance shall be served:
         	So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
         	Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
         	More should I question thee, and more I must,
         	Though more to know could not be more to trust,
         	From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest
         	Unquestioned welcome and undoubted blest.
         	Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
         	As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.

         	[Enter COUNTESS and Clown]
         
         COUNTESS	Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of
         	your breeding.
         
         Clown	I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
         	know my business is but to the court.
         
         COUNTESS	To the court! why, what place make you special,
         	when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
         
         Clown	Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
         	may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make
         	a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,
         	has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed
         	such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
         	court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
         	men.
         
         COUNTESS	Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all
         	questions.
         
         Clown	It is  a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,
         	the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
         	buttock, or any buttock.
         
         COUNTESS	Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
         
         Clown	As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
         	as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's
         	rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove
         	Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
         	hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen
         	to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the
         	friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.
         
         COUNTESS	Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
         	questions?
         
         Clown	From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
         	will fit any question.
         
         COUNTESS	It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
         	must fit all demands.
         
         Clown	But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
         	should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that
         	belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall
         	do you no harm to learn.
         
         COUNTESS	To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in
         	question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I
         	pray you, sir, are you a courtier?
         
         Clown	O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,
         	more, a hundred of them.
         
         COUNTESS	Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
         
         Clown	O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.
         
         COUNTESS	I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
         
         Clown	O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
         
         COUNTESS	You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.
         
         Clown	O Lord, sir! spare not me.
         
         COUNTESS	Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and
         	'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very
         	sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
         	to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.
         
         Clown	I never had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,
         	sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.
         
         COUNTESS	I play the noble housewife with the time
         	To entertain't so merrily with a fool.
         
         Clown	O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.
         
         COUNTESS	An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,
         	And urge her to a present answer back:
         	Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
         	This is not much.
         
         Clown	Not much commendation to them.
         
         COUNTESS	Not much employment for you: you understand me?
         
         Clown	Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.
         
         COUNTESS	Haste you again.

         	[Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES]
         
         LAFEU	They say miracles are past; and we have our
         	philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,
         	things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that
         	we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
         	into seeming knowledge, when we should submit
         	ourselves to an unknown fear.
         
         PAROLLES	Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
         	shot out in our latter times.

         LAFEU	Uncertain life, and sure death.
         
         PAROLLES	Just, you say well; so would I have said.
         
         LAFEU	I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.
         
         PAROLLES	It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you
         	shall read it in--what do you call there?
         
         LAFEU	A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.
         
         PAROLLES	That's it; I would have said the very same.

         	brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most
         	facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--
         
         LAFEU	Very hand of heaven.
         
         PAROLLES	Ay, so I say.

         	[pausing]
         
         	and debile minister, great power, great
         	transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a

         	generally thankful.

         	And with this healthful hand, whose banished sense
         	Thou hast repealed, a second time receive
         	The confirmation of my promised gift,
         	Which but attends thy naming.
         
         	[Enter three or four Lords]
         
         	Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
         	Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
         	Over whom both sovereign power and father's voice
         	I have to use: thy frank election make;
         	Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
         
         HELENA	To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
         	Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!
         
         LAFEU	I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,
         	My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
         	And writ as little beard.
         
         KING	Peruse them well:
         	Not one of those but had a noble father.
         
         HELENA	Gentlemen,
         	Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.
         
         All	We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
         
         HELENA	I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
         	That I protest I simply am a maid.
         	Please it your majesty, I have done already:
         	The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
         	'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
         	Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
         	We'll never come there again.'
         
         KING	Make choice; and, see,
         	Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
         
         HELENA	Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
         	And to imperial Love, that god most high,
         	Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
         
         First Lord	And grant it.
         
         HELENA	                  Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
         
         LAFEU	I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
         	for my life.
         
         HELENA	The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
         	Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
         	Love make your fortunes twenty times above
         	Her that so wishes and her humble love!
         
         Second Lord	No better, if you please.
         
         HELENA	My wish receive,
         	Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.
         
         LAFEU	Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
         	Ied have them whipped; or I would send them to the
         	Turk, to make eunuchs of.
         
         HELENA	Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
         	I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
         	Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
         	Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
         
         LAFEU	These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:
         	sure, they are bastards to the English; the French
         	never got 'em.
         
         HELENA	You are too young, too happy, and too good,
         	To make yourself a son out of my blood.
         
         Fourth Lord	Fair one, I think not so.
         
         LAFEU	There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk
         	wine: but if thou beest not an ass, I am a youth
         	of fourteen; I have known thee already.
         
         HELENA	[To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give
         	Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
         	Into your guiding power. This is the man.
         
         KING	Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
         
         BERTRAM	My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
         	In such a business give me leave to use
         	The help of mine own eyes.
         
         KING	Knowest thou not, Bertram,
         	What she has done for me?
         
         BERTRAM	Yes, my good lord;
         	But never hope to know why I should marry her.
         
         KING	Thou knowest she has raised me from my sickly bed.
         
         BERTRAM	But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
         	Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
         	She had her breeding at my father's charge.
         	A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
         	Rather corrupt me ever!
         
         KING	'Tis only title thou disdainest in her, the which
         	I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
         	Of colour, weight, and heat, poured all together,
         	Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
         	In differences so mighty. If she be
         	All that is virtuous, save what thou disst,
         	A poor physician's daughter, thou disst
         	Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
         	From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
         	The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
         	Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
         	It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
         	Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
         	The property by what it is should go,
         	Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
         	In these to nature she's immediate heir,
         	And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
         	Which challenges itself as honour's born
         	And is not  the sire: honours thrive,
         	When rather from our acts we them derive
         	Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
         	Deboshed on every tomb, on every grave
         	A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
         	Where dust and damned oblivion is the tomb
         	Of honoured bones indeed. What should be said?
         	If thou canst  this creature as a maid,
         	I can create the rest: virtue and she
         	Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
         
         BERTRAM	I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.
         
         KING	Thou wrongest thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
         
         HELENA	That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:
         	Let the rest go.
         
         KING	My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
         	I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
         	Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
         	That dost in vile misprision shackle up
         	My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
         	We, poising us in her defective scale,
         	Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
         	It is in us to plant thine honour where
         	We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
         	Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
         	Believe not thy disdain, but presently
         	Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
         	Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
         	Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
         	Into the staggers and the careless lapse
         	Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
         	Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
         	Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
         
         BERTRAM	Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
         	My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
         	What great creation and what dole of honour
         	Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
         	Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
         	The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
         	Is as 'twere born so.
         
         KING	Take her by the hand,
         	And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
         	A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
         	A balance more replete.
         
         BERTRAM	I take her hand.
         
         KING	Good fortune and the favour of the king
         	Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
         	Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
         	And be performed to-night: the solemn feast
         	Shall more attend upon the coming space,
         	Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
         	Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.

         LAFEU	I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty
         	wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
         	travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the
         	bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
         	believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I
         	have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care
         	not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and
         	that thou't scarce worth.
         
         PAROLLES	Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--

         	through thee. Give me thy hand.
         
         PAROLLES	My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
         
         LAFEU	Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
         
         PAROLLES	I have not, my lord, deserved it.
         
         LAFEU	Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not
         	bate thee a scruple.
         
         PAROLLES	Well, I shall be wiser.
         
         LAFEU	Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at
         	a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou beest bound
         	in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is
         	to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold
         	my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,
         	that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.

         PAROLLES	I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
         	some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good

         PAROLLES	Ay, sir.

         	thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
         	honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat
         	thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and
         	every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
         	created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.
         
         PAROLLES	This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
         
         LAFEU	Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a
         	kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and
         	no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords
         	and honourable personages than the commission of your

         	I know not yet.
         
         PAROLLES	Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
         	He wears his honour in a box unseen,
         	That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
         	Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
         	Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
         	Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions
         	France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
         	Therefore, to the war!
         
         BERTRAM	It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
         	Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
         	And wherefore I am fled; write to the king
         	That which I durst not speak; his present gift
         	Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
         	Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
         	To the dark house and the detested wife.

         	I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

         HELENA	What two things?
         
         Clown	One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her
         	quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence

         PAROLLES	You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them
         	on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?
         
         Clown	So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,
         	I would she did as you say.
         
         PAROLLES	Why, I say nothing.
         
         Clown	Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's
         	tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say
         	nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have
         	nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which
         	is within a very little of nothing.
         
         PAROLLES	Away! thou'rt a knave.
         
         Clown	You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a
         	knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
         	been truth, sir.

         Clown	Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you
         	taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;

         	Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
         	A very serious business calls on him.
         	The great prerogative and rite of love,
         	Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
         	But puts it off to a compelled restraint;
         	Whose want, and whose delay, is strewed with sweets,
         	Which they distil now in the curbed time,
         	To make the coming hour overflow with joy
         	And pleasure drown the brim.
         
         HELENA	What's his will else?
         
         PAROLLES	That you will take your instant leave o' the king
         	And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
         	Strengthened with what apology you think
         	May make it probable need.
         
         HELENA	What more commands he?
         
         PAROLLES	That, having this obtained, you presently
         	Attend his further pleasure.
         
         HELENA	In every thing I wait upon his will.

         	transgressed against his valour; and my state that

         HELENA	I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
         	Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;

         Second Gentleman	Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:
         	We met him thitherward; for thence we came,

         	But I do wash his name out of my blood,
         	And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
         
         Second Gentleman	Ay, madam.

         	To tell him that his sword can never win
         	The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
         	Written to bear along.
         
         Second Gentleman	We serve you, madam,
         	In that and all your worthiest affairs.
         
         COUNTESS	Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
         	Will you draw near!

         HELENA	'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
         	Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
         	Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;
         	Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
         	That chase thee from thy country and expose
         	Those tender limbs of thine to the event
         	Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
         	That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
         	Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
         	Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
         	That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
         	Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
         	That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
         	Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
         	Whoever charges on his forward breast,
         	I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
         	And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
         	His death was so effected: better 'twere
         	I met the ravin lion when he roared
         	With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
         	That all the miseries which nature owes
         	Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
         	Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
         	As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
         	My being here it is that holds thee hence:
         	Shall I stay here to do't?  no, no, although
         	The air of paradise did fan the house
         	And angels officed all: I will be gone,
         	That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
         	To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!
         	For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

         BERTRAM	Sir, it is
         	A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
         	We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
         	To the extreme edge of hazard.

         COUNTESS	Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
         	Might you not know she would do as she has done,
         	By sending me a letter? Read it again.
         
         Steward	[Reads]
         
         	I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:
         	Ambitious love hath so in me offended,
         	That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
         	With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
         	Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
         	My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:
         	Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
         	His name with zealous fervor sanctify:
         	His taken labours bid him me forgive;
         	I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
         	From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
         	Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:
         	He is too good and fair for death and me:
         	Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.
         
         COUNTESS	Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
         	Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,
         	As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,
         	I could have well diverted her intents,
         	Which thus she hath prevented.
         
         Steward	Pardon me, madam:
         	If I had given you this at over-night,
         	She might have been overta'en; and yet she writes,
         	Pursuit would be but vain.
         
         COUNTESS	What angel shall
         	Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
         	Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
         	And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
         	Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
         	To this unworthy husband of his wife;
         	Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
         	That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.

         	Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
         	When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
         	He will return; and hope I may that she,
         	Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
         	Led hither by pure love: which of them both
         	Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense
         	To make distinction: provide this messenger:

         	and MARIANA, with other Citizens]
         
         Widow	Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we
         	shall lose all the sight.
         
         DIANA	They say the French count has done most honourable service.
         
         Widow	It is reported that he has taken their greatest
         	commander; and that with his own hand he slew the
         	duke's brother.
         
         	[Tucket]
         
         	We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary
         	way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.
         
         MARIANA	Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with
         	the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this
         	French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and
         	no legacy is so rich as honesty.
         
         Widow	I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited
         	by a gentleman his companion.
         
         MARIANA	I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a
         	filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the
         	young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,
         	enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of
         	lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid
         	hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,
         	example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of
         	maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,
         	but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten
         	them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but
         	I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,
         	though there were no further danger known but the
         	modesty which is so lost.
         
         DIANA	You shall not need to fear me.
         
         Widow	I hope so.
         
         	[Enter HELENA, disguised  a Pilgrim]
         
         	Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at
         	my house; thither they send one another: I'll
         	question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?
         
         HELENA	To Saint Jaques le Grand.
         	Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
         
         Widow	At the Saint Francis here beside the port.
         
         HELENA	Is this the way?
         
         Widow	Ay, marry, is't.
         
         	[A march afar]
         
         	Hark you! they come this way.
         	If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
         	But till the troops come by,
         	I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;
         	The rather, for I think I know your hostess
         	As ample as myself.
         
         HELENA	Is it yourself?
         
         Widow	If you shall please so, pilgrim.
         
         HELENA	I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
         
         Widow	You came, I think, from France?
         
         HELENA	I did so.
         
         Widow	Here you shall see a countryman of yours
         	That has done worthy service.
         
         HELENA	His name, I pray you.
         
         DIANA	The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?
         
         HELENA	But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:
         	His face I know not.
         
         DIANA	Whatsomever he is,
         	He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
         	As 'tis reported, for the king had married him
         	Against his liking: think you it is so?
         
         HELENA	Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.
         
         DIANA	There is a gentleman that serves the count
         	Reports but coarsely of her.
         
         HELENA	What's his name?
         
         DIANA	Monsieur Parolles.
         
         HELENA	                  O, I believe with him,
         	In argument of praise, or to the worth
         	Of the great count himself, she is too mean
         	To have her name repeated: all her deserving
         	Is a reserved honesty, and that
         	I have not heard examined.
         
         DIANA	Alas, poor lady!
         	'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
         	Of a detesting lord.
         
         Widow	I warrant, good creature, wheresoever she is,
         	Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her
         	A shrewd turn, if she pleased.
         
         HELENA	How do you mean?
         	May be the amorous count solicits her
         	In the unlawful purpose.
         
         Widow	He does indeed;
         	And brokes with all that can in such a suit
         	Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
         	But she is armed for him and keeps her guard
         	In honestest defence.
         
         MARIANA	The gods forbid else!
         
         Widow	So, now they come:

         	[Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army]

         	That, Escalus.
         
         HELENA	                  Which is the Frenchman?
         
         DIANA	He;
         	That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
         	I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
         	He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?
         
         HELENA	I  him well.
         
         DIANA	'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave
         	That leads him to these places: were I his lady,
         	I would Poison that vile rascal.
         
         HELENA	Which is he?
         
         DIANA	That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?
         
         HELENA	Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.
         
         PAROLLES	Lose our drum! well.
         
         MARIANA	He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.
         
         Widow	Marry, hang you!
         
         MARIANA	And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!

         	Where you shall host: of enjoined penitents
         	There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
         	Already at my house.
         
         HELENA	I humbly thank you:
         	Please it this matron and this gentle maid
         	To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
         	Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,
         	I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
         	Worthy the note.

         	[Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords]
         
         Second Lord	Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his
         	way.
         
         First Lord	If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no
         	more in your respect.
         
         Second Lord	On my life, my lord, a bubble.
         
         BERTRAM	Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
         
         Second Lord	Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
         	without any malice, but to speak of him as my
         	kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and
         	endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
         	of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
         	entertainment.
         
         First Lord	It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in
         	his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
         	great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.
         
         BERTRAM	I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
         
         First Lord	None better than to let him fetch off his drum,
         	which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
         
         Second Lord	I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
         	surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he
         	knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
         	him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
         	is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
         	we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
         	present at his examination: if he do not, for the
         	promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
         	base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
         	intelligence in his power against you, and that with
         	the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never
         	trust my judgment in any thing.
         
         First Lord	O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;
         	he says he has a stratagem for't: when your
         	lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to
         	what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
         	melted, if you give him not John Drum's
         	entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
         	Here he comes.
         
         	[Enter PAROLLES]
         
         Second Lord	[Aside to BERTRAM]  O, for the love of laughter,
         	hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch
         	off his drum in any hand.
         
         BERTRAM	How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your
         	disposition.
         
         First Lord	A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.
         
         PAROLLES	'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!
         	There was excellent command,--to charge in with our
         	horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
         
         First Lord	That was not to be blamed in the command of the
         	service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar
         	himself could not have prevented, if he had been
         	there to command.
         
         BERTRAM	Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
         	dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is
         	not to be recovered.
         
         PAROLLES	It might have been recovered.
         
         BERTRAM	It might; but it is not now.
         
         PAROLLES	It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
         	service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
         	performer, I would have that drum or another, or
         	'hic jacet.'
         
         BERTRAM	Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you
         	think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
         	instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
         	be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will
         	grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
         	speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.
         	and extend to you what further becomes his
         	greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your
         	worthiness.
         
         PAROLLES	By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
         
         BERTRAM	But you must not now slumber in it.
         
         PAROLLES	I'll about it this evening: and I will presently
         	pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
         	certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;
         	and by midnight look to hear further from me.
         
         BERTRAM	May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?
         
         PAROLLES	I know not what the success will be, my lord; but
         	the attempt I vow.
         
         BERTRAM	I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of
         	thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
         
         PAROLLES	I love not many words.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         Second Lord	No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
         	strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems
         	to undertake this business, which he knows is not to
         	be done; damns himself to do and dares better be
         	damned than to do't?
         
         First Lord	You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it
         	is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
         	for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but
         	when you find him out, you have him ever after.
         
         BERTRAM	Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of
         	this that so seriously he does address himself unto?
         
         Second Lord	None in the world; but return with an invention and
         	clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we
         	have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall
         	to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.
         
         First Lord	We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
         	him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:
         	when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a
         	sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this
         	very night.
         
         Second Lord	I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.
         
         BERTRAM	Your brother he shall go along with me.
         
         Second Lord	As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BERTRAM	Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
         	The lass I spoke of.
         
         First Lord	But you say she's honest.
         
         BERTRAM	That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
         	And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
         	By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,
         	Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
         	And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:
         	Will you go see her?
         
         First Lord	With all my heart, my lord.

         SCENE V	Florence. The Widow's house.
         
         
         	[Enter HELENA and Widow]
         
         HELENA	If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
         	I know not how I shall assure you further,
         	But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
         
         Widow	Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,
         	Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
         	And would not put my reputation now
         	In any staining act.
         
         HELENA	Nor would I wish you.
         	First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,
         	And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
         	Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
         	By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
         	Err in bestowing it.
         
         Widow	I should believe you:
         	For you have showed me that which well approves
         	You're great in fortune.
         
         HELENA	Take this purse of gold,
         	And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
         	Which I will over-pay and pay again
         	When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,
         	Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
         	Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,
         	As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
         	Now his important blood will nought deny
         	That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
         	That downward hath succeeded in his house
         	From son to son, some four or five descents
         	Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
         	In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
         	To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
         	However repented after.
         
         Widow	Now I see
         	The bottom of your purpose.
         
         HELENA	You see it lawful, then: it is no more,
         	But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
         	Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
         	In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
         	Herself most chastely absent: after this,
         	To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
         	To what is passed already.
         
         Widow	I have yielded:
         	Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
         	That time and place with this deceit so lawful
         	May prove coherent. Every night he comes
         	With musics of all sorts and songs composed
         	To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
         	To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
         	As if his life lay on't.
         
         HELENA	Why then to-night
         	Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
         	Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
         	And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
         	Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:
         	But let's about it.

         	[Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other
         	Soldiers in ambush]
         
         Second Lord	He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
         	When you sally upon him, speak what terrible
         	language you will: though you understand it not
         	yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to
         	understand him, unless some one among us whom we
         	must produce for an interpreter.
         
         First Soldier	Good captain, let me be the interpreter.
         
         Second Lord	Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?
         
         First Soldier	No, sir, I warrant you.
         
         Second Lord	But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?
         
         First Soldier	E'en such as you speak to me.
         
         Second Lord	He must think us some band of strangers i' the
         	adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
         	all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every
         	one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we
         	speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to
         	know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
         	gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,
         	interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,
         	ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,
         	and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
         
         	[Enter PAROLLES]
         
         PAROLLES	Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be
         	time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
         	done? It must be a very plausive invention that
         	carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces
         	have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
         	my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the
         	fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not
         	daring the reports of my tongue.
         
         Second Lord	This is the first truth that ever thine own tongue
         	was guilty of.
         
         PAROLLES	What the devil should move me to undertake the
         	recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the
         	impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
         	must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in
         	exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they
         	will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great
         	ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the
         	instance? Tongue, I must put you into a
         	butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of
         	Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
         
         Second Lord	Is it possible he should know what he is, and be
         	that he is?
         
         PAROLLES	I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
         	turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
         
         Second Lord	We cannot afford you so.
         
         PAROLLES	Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
         	stratagem.
         
         Second Lord	'Twould not do.
         
         PAROLLES	Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.
         
         Second Lord	Hardly serve.
         
         PAROLLES	Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.
         
         Second Lord	How deep?
         
         PAROLLES	Thirty fathom.
         
         Second Lord	Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
         
         PAROLLES	I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear
         	I recovered it.
         
         Second Lord	You shall hear one anon.
         
         PAROLLES	A drum now of the enemy's,--
         
         	[Alarum within]
         
         Second Lord	Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
         
         All	Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.
         
         PAROLLES	O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.

         First Soldier	Boskos thromuldo boskos.
         
         PAROLLES	I know you are the Muskos' regiment:
         	And I shall lose my life for want of language;
         	If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,
         	Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll
         	Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.
         
         First Soldier	Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak
         	thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy
         	faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
         
         PAROLLES	O!
         
         First Soldier	O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
         
         Second Lord	Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
         
         First Soldier	The general is content to spare thee yet;
         	And, hoodwinked as thou art, will lead thee on
         	To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform
         	Something to save thy life.
         
         PAROLLES	O, let me live!
         	And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
         	Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that
         	Which you will wonder at.
         
         First Soldier	But wilt thou faithfully?
         
         PAROLLES	If I do not, damn me.
         
         First Soldier	Acordo linta.
         	Come on; thou art granted space.

         	Till we do hear from them.
         
         Second Soldier	Captain, I will.
         
         Second Lord	A' will betray us all unto ourselves:
         	Inform on that.
         
         Second Soldier	                  So I will, sir.

         	[Enter BERTRAM and DIANA]
         
         BERTRAM	They told me that your name was Fontibell.
         
         DIANA	No, my good lord, Diana.
         
         BERTRAM	Titled goddess;
         	And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
         	In your fine frame hath love no quality?
         	If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
         	You are no maiden, but a monument:
         	When you are dead, you should be such a one
         	As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
         	And now you should be as your mother was
         	When your sweet self was got.
         
         DIANA	She then was honest.
         
         BERTRAM	So should you be.
         
         DIANA	No:
         	My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
         	As you owe to your wife.
         
         BERTRAM	No more o' that;
         	I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
         	I was compelled to her; but I love thee
         	By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
         	Do thee all rights of service.
         
         DIANA	Ay, so you serve us
         	Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
         	You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
         	And mock us with our bareness.
         
         BERTRAM	How have I sworn!
         
         DIANA	'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
         	But the plain single vow that is vowed true.
         	What is not holy, that we swear not by,
         	But take the Highest to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
         	If I should swear by God's great attributes,
         	I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
         	When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
         	To swear by him whom I protest to love,
         	That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
         	Are words and poor conditions, but unsealed,
         	At least in my opinion.
         
         BERTRAM	Change it, change it;
         	Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;
         	And my integrity never knew the crafts
         	That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
         	But give thyself unto my sick desires,
         	Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever
         	My love as it begins shall so persever.
         
         DIANA	I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
         	That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
         
         BERTRAM	I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power
         	To give it from me.
         
         DIANA	Will you not, my lord?
         
         BERTRAM	It is an honour 'longing to our house,
         	Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
         	Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
         	In me to lose.
         
         DIANA	                  Mine honour's such a ring:
         	My chastity's the jewel of our house,
         	Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
         	Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
         	In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
         	Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
         	Against your vain assault.
         
         BERTRAM	Here, take my ring:
         	My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
         	And I'll be bid by thee.
         
         DIANA	When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:
         	I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
         	Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
         	When you have conquered my yet maiden bed,
         	Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
         	My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
         	When back again this ring shall be delivered:
         	And on your finger in the night I'll put
         	Another ring, that what in time proceeds
         	May token to the future our past deeds.
         	Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won
         	A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
         
         BERTRAM	A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         DIANA	For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
         	You may so in the end.
         	My mother told me just how he would woo,
         	As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men
         	Have the  oaths: he had sworn to marry me
         	When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
         	When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
         	Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
         	Only in this disguise I think't no sin
         	To cozen him that would unjustly win.

         SCENE I	The Florentine camp.
         
         
         	[Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers]
         
         First Lord	You have not given him his mother's letter?
         
         Second Lord	I have delivered it an hour since: there is
         	something in't that stings his nature; for on the
         	reading it he changed almost into another man.
         
         First Lord	He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
         	off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
         
         Second Lord	Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
         	displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his
         	bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
         	thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.
         
         First Lord	When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the
         	grave of it.
         
         Second Lord	He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
         	Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he
         	fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
         	given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself
         	made in the unchaste composition.
         
         First Lord	Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,
         	what things are we!
         
         Second Lord	Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
         	of all treasons, we still see them reveal
         	themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,
         	so he that in this action contrives against his own
         	nobility, in his proper stream overflows himself.
         
         First Lord	Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
         	our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
         	company to-night?
         
         Second Lord	Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
         
         First Lord	That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see
         	his company anatomized, that he might take a measure
         	of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had
         	set this counterfeit.
         
         Second Lord	We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
         	presence must be the whip of the other.
         
         First Lord	In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?
         
         Second Lord	I hear there is an overture of peace.
         
         First Lord	Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
         
         Second Lord	What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
         	higher, or return again into France?
         
         First Lord	I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
         	of his council.
         
         Second Lord	Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal
         	of his act.
         
         First Lord	Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his
         	house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
         	le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere
         	sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the
         	tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
         	grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
         	now she sings in heaven.
         
         Second Lord	How is this justified?
         
         First Lord	The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
         	makes her story true, even to the point of her
         	death: her death itself, which could not be her
         	office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
         	the rector of the place.
         
         Second Lord	Hath the count all this intelligence?
         
         First Lord	Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
         	point, so to the full arming of the verity.
         
         Second Lord	I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
         
         First Lord	How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
         
         Second Lord	And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
         	in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
         	here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
         	with a shame as ample.
         
         First Lord	The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
         	ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
         	faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
         	despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.
         
         	[Enter a Messenger]
         
         	How now! where's your master?
         
         Servant	He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath
         	taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
         	morning for France. The duke hath offered him
         	letters of commendations to the king.
         
         Second Lord	They shall be no more than needful there, if they
         	were more than they can commend.
         
         First Lord	They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
         	Here's his lordship now.
         
         	[Enter BERTRAM]
         
         	How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?
         
         BERTRAM	I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
         	month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
         	I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
         	nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
         	lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
         	and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
         	many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
         	that I have not ended yet.
         
         Second Lord	If the business be of any difficulty, and this
         	morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
         	your lordship.
         
         BERTRAM	I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
         	hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
         	dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
         	bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
         	me,  a double-meaning prophesier.
         
         Second Lord	Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,
         	poor gallant knave.
         
         BERTRAM	No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
         	his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
         
         Second Lord	I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
         	him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
         	he weeps  a wench that had shed her milk: he
         	hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
         	to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
         	this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
         	stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?
         
         BERTRAM	Nothing of me, has a'?
         
         Second Lord	His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
         	face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you
         	are, you must have the patience to hear it.
         
         	[Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier]
         
         BERTRAM	A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of
         	me: hush, hush!
         
         First Lord	Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa
         
         First Soldier	He calls for the tortures: what will you say
         	without 'em?
         
         PAROLLES	I will confess what I know without constraint: if
         	ye pinch me  a pasty, I can say no more.
         
         First Soldier	Bosko chimurcho.
         
         First Lord	Boblibindo chicurmurco.
         
         First Soldier	You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
         	answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
         
         PAROLLES	And truly, as I hope to live.
         
         First Soldier	[Reads]  'First demand of him how many horse the
         	duke is strong.' What say you to that?
         
         PAROLLES	Five or six thousand; but very weak and
         	unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and
         	the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
         	and credit and as I hope to live.
         
         First Soldier	Shall I set down your answer so?
         
         PAROLLES	Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.
         
         BERTRAM	All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
         
         First Lord	You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
         	Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own
         	phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the
         	knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
         	his dagger.
         
         Second Lord	I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
         	clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
         	by wearing his apparel neatly.
         
         First Soldier	Well, that's set down.
         
         PAROLLES	Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say
         	true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.
         
         First Lord	He's very near the truth in this.
         
         BERTRAM	But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
         	delivers it.
         
         PAROLLES	Poor rogues, I pray you, say.
         
         First Soldier	Well, that's set down.
         
         PAROLLES	I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the
         	rogues are marvellous poor.
         
         First Soldier	[Reads]  edemand of him, of what strength they are
         	a-foot.' What say you to that?
         
         PAROLLES	By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
         	hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
         	hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so
         	many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
         	and Grat, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
         	company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bent, two hundred and
         	fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
         	sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
         	poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off
         	their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.
         
         BERTRAM	What shall be done to him?
         
         First Lord	Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
         	condition, and what credit I have with the duke.
         
         First Soldier	Well, that's set down.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain
         	be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is
         	with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and
         	expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not
         	possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to
         	corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what
         	do you know of it?
         
         PAROLLES	I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
         	the inter'gatories: demand them singly.
         
         First Soldier	Do you know this Captain Dumain?
         
         PAROLLES	I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,
         	from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
         	fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not
         	say him nay.
         
         BERTRAM	Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
         	his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
         
         First Soldier	Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?
         
         PAROLLES	Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
         
         First Lord	Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
         	lordship anon.
         
         First Soldier	What is his reputation with the duke?
         
         PAROLLES	The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
         	of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
         	out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.
         
         First Soldier	Marry, we'll search.
         
         PAROLLES	In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,
         	or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
         	in my tent.
         
         First Soldier	Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?
         
         PAROLLES	I do not know if it be it or no.
         
         BERTRAM	Our interpreter does it well.
         
         First Lord	Excellently.
         
         First Soldier	[Reads]  edian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--
         
         PAROLLES	That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an
         	advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
         	Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
         	Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
         	ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.
         
         First Soldier	Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.
         
         PAROLLES	My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
         	behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be
         	a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
         	virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.
         
         BERTRAM	Damnable both-sides rogue!
         
         First Soldier	[Reads]  'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
         	After he scores, he never pays the score:
         	Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
         	He never pays after-debts, take it before;
         	And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
         	Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
         	For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,
         	Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
         	Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
         			  PAROLLES.'
         
         BERTRAM	He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
         	in's forehead.
         
         Second Lord	This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
         	linguist and the armipotent soldier.
         
         BERTRAM	I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
         	he's a cat to me.
         
         First Soldier	I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be
         	fain to hang you.
         
         PAROLLES	My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
         	die; but that, my offences being many, I would
         	repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
         	sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.
         
         First Soldier	We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
         	therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
         	have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
         	his valour: what is his honesty?
         
         PAROLLES	He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
         	rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
         	professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he
         	is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
         	such volubility, that you would think truth were a
         	fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
         	be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
         	harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
         	know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
         	little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
         	every thing that an honest man should not have; what
         	an honest man should have, he has nothing.
         
         First Lord	I begin to love him for this.
         
         BERTRAM	For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
         	him for me, he's more and more a cat.
         
         First Soldier	What say you to his expertness in war?
         
         PAROLLES	Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
         	tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of
         	his soldiership I know not; except, in that country
         	he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
         	called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
         	files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
         	this I am not certain.
         
         First Lord	He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
         	rarity redeems him.
         
         BERTRAM	A pox on him, he's a cat still.
         
         First Soldier	His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
         	to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
         
         PAROLLES	Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple
         	of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the
         	entail from all remainders, and a perpetual
         	succession for it perpetually.
         
         First Soldier	What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
         
         Second Lord	Why does be ask him of me?
         
         First Soldier	What's he?
         
         PAROLLES	E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so
         	great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
         	deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,
         	yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:
         	in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming
         	on he has the cramp.
         
         First Soldier	If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
         	the Florentine?
         
         PAROLLES	Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.
         
         First Soldier	I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.
         
         PAROLLES	[Aside]  I'll no more drumming; a plague of all
         	drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
         	beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
         	the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
         	would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?
         
         First Soldier	There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the
         	general says, you that have so traitorously
         	discovered the secrets of your army and made such
         	pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can

         	I am for France.
         
         First Lord	Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
         	you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?
         	an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:
         	but fare you well.

         	But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
         	As captain shall: simply the thing I am
         	Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
         	Let him fear this, for it will come to pass

         	Time was, I did him a desired office,
         	Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
         	Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
         	And answer, thanks: I duly am informed
         	His grace is at Marseilles; to which place
         	We have convenient convoy. You must know

         Widow	Gentle madam,
         	You never had a servant to whose trust
         	Your business was more welcome.
         
         HELENA	Nor you, mistress,
         	Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
         	To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven
         	Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
         	As it hath fated her to be my motive
         	And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
         	That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
         	When saucy trusting of the cozened thoughts
         	Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play
         	With what it loathes for that which is away.
         	But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
         	Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
         	Something in my behalf.
         
         DIANA	Let death and honesty
         	Go with your impositions, I am yours
         	Upon your will to suffer.

         	[Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown]
         
         LAFEU	No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
         	fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
         	made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
         	his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
         	this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
         	by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.
         
         COUNTESS	I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
         	most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
         	praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
         	flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
         	could not have owed her a more rooted love.
         
         LAFEU	'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a
         	thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.
         
         Clown	Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
         	salad, or rather, the herb of grace.
         
         LAFEU	They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
         
         Clown	I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
         	skill in grass.
         
         LAFEU	Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?
         
         Clown	A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
         
         LAFEU	Your distinction?
         
         Clown	I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.
         
         LAFEU	So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
         
         Clown	And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
         
         LAFEU	I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.
         
         Clown	At your service.
         
         LAFEU	No, no, no.
         
         Clown	Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
         	great a prince as you are.
         
         LAFEU	Who's that? a Frenchman?
         
         Clown	Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy
         	is more hotter in France than there.
         
         LAFEU	What prince is that?
         
         Clown	The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
         	darkness; alias, the devil.
         
         LAFEU	Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
         	to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;
         	serve him still.
         
         Clown	I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
         	great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
         	good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
         	world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
         	the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
         	too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
         	themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
         	tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
         	leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
         
         LAFEU	Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I
         	tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
         	with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
         	looked to, without any tricks.
         
         Clown	If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
         	jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         LAFEU	A shrewd knave and an unhappy.
         
         COUNTESS	So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
         	sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
         	which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
         	indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.
         
         LAFEU	I  him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to
         	tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and
         	that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
         	moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
         	my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,
         	his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
         	first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
         	it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
         	conceived against your son, there is no fitter
         	matter. How does your ladyship  it?
         
         COUNTESS	With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
         	happily effected.
         
         LAFEU	His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
         	body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
         	to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
         	intelligence hath seldom failed.
         
         COUNTESS	It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
         	die. I have letters that my son will be here
         	to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
         	with me till they meet together.
         
         LAFEU	Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
         	safely be admitted.
         
         COUNTESS	You need but plead your honourable privilege.
         
         LAFEU	Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I
         	thank my God it holds yet.
         
         	[Re-enter Clown]
         
         Clown	O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
         	velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
         	or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of
         	velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
         	half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
         
         LAFEU	A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
         	of honour; so be is that.
         
         Clown	But it is your carbonadoed face.
         
         LAFEU	Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
         	with the young noble soldier.
         
         Clown	Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
         	hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head

         ACT V
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
         
         
         	[Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two
         	French Lords, with Attendants]
         
         KING	We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem
         	Was made much poorer by it: but your son,
         	As mad in folly, lacked the sense to know
         	Her estimation home.
         
         COUNTESS	'Tis past, my liege;
         	And I beseech your majesty to make it
         	Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;
         	When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
         	Overbears it and burns on.
         
         KING	My honoured lady,
         	I have forgiven and forgotten all;
         	Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
         	And watched the time to shoot.
         
         LAFEU	This I must say,
         	But first I beg my pardon, the young lord
         	Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady
         	Offence of mighty note; but to himself
         	The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
         	Whose beauty did astonish the survey
         	Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
         	Whose dear perfection hearts that scorned to serve
         	Humbly called mistress.
         
         KING	Praising what is lost
         	Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
         	We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
         	All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;
         	The nature of his great offence is dead,
         	And deeper than oblivion we do bury
         	The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
         	A stranger, no offender; and inform him
         	So 'tis our will he should.
         
         Gentleman	I shall, my liege.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING	What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?
         
         LAFEU	All that he is hath reference to your highness.
         
         KING	Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
         	That set him high in fame.
         
         	[Enter BERTRAM]
         
         LAFEU	He looks well on't.
         
         KING	I am not a day of season,
         	For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
         	In me at once: but to the brightest beams
         	Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
         	The time is fair again.
         
         BERTRAM	My high-repented blames,
         	Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
         
         KING	All is whole;
         	Not one word more of the consumed time.
         	Let's take the instant by the forward top;
         	For we are old, and on our quickest decrees
         	The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
         	Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
         	The daughter of this lord?
         
         BERTRAM	Admiringly, my liege, at first
         	I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
         	Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
         	Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
         	Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
         	Which warped the line of every other favour;
         	Scorned a fair colour, or expressed it stolen;
         	Extended or contracted all proportions
         	To a most hideous object: thence it came
         	That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
         	Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
         	The dust that did offend it.
         
         KING	Well excused:
         	That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
         	From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
         	 a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
         	To the great sender turns a sour offence,
         	Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
         	Make trivial price of serious things we have,
         	Not knowing them until we know their grave:
         	Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
         	Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
         	Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
         	While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
         	Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
         	Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
         	The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
         	To see our widower's second marriage-day.
         
         COUNTESS	Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
         	Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
         
         LAFEU	Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
         	Must be digested, give a favour from you
         	To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
         	That she may quickly come.
         
         	[BERTRAM gives a ring]
         
         		     By my old beard,
         	And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,
         	Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
         	The last that ever I took her at court,
         	I saw upon her finger.
         
         BERTRAM	Hers it was not.
         
         KING	Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
         	While I was speaking, oft was fastened to't.
         	This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
         	I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
         	Necessitied to help, that by this token
         	I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
         	her
         	Of what should stead her most?
         
         BERTRAM	My gracious sovereign,
         	However it pleases you to take it so,
         	The ring was never hers.
         
         COUNTESS	Son, on my life,
         	I have seen her wear it; and she reckoned it
         	At her life's rate.
         
         LAFEU	I am sure I saw her wear it.
         
         BERTRAM	You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
         	In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
         	Wrapped in a paper, which contained the name
         	Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
         	I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
         	To mine own fortune and informed her fully
         	I could not answer in that course of honour
         	As she had made the overture, she ceased
         	In heavy satisfaction and would never
         	Receive the ring again.
         
         KING	Plutus himself,
         	That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
         	Hath not in nature's mystery more science
         	Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
         	Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
         	That you are well acquainted with yourself,
         	Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
         	You got it from her: she called the saints to surety
         	That she would never put it from her finger,
         	Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
         	Where you have never come, or sent it us
         	Upon her great disaster.
         
         BERTRAM	She never saw it.
         
         KING	Thou speakest it falsely, as I love mine honour;
         	And makest conjectural fears to come into me
         	Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
         	That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--
         	And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
         	And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
         	Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
         	More than to see this ring. Take him away.
         
         	[Guards seize BERTRAM]
         
         	My fore-past proofs, however the matter fall,
         	Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
         	Having vainly feared too little. Away with him!
         	We'll sift this matter further.
         
         BERTRAM	If you shall prove
         	This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
         	Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
         	Where yet she never was.
         
         	[Exit, guarded]
         
         KING	I am wrapped in dismal thinkings.
         
         	[Enter a Gentleman]
         
         Gentleman	Gracious sovereign,
         	Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
         	Here's a petition from a Florentine,
         	Who hath for four or five removes come short
         	To tender it herself. I undertook it,
         	Vanquished thereto by the fair grace and speech
         	Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
         	Is here attending: her business looks in her
         	With an importing visage; and she told me,
         	In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
         	Your highness with herself.
         
         KING	[Reads]  Upon his many protestations to marry me
         	when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
         	me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows
         	are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He
         	stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
         	him to his country for justice: grant it me, O
         	king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer
         	flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
         		                  DIANA CAPILET.
         
         LAFEU	I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for
         	this: I'll none of him.
         
         KING	The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,
         	To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:
         	Go speedily and bring again the count.
         	I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
         	Was foully snatched.
         
         COUNTESS	Now, justice on the doers!
         
         	[Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded]
         
         KING	I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
         	And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
         	Yet you desire to marry.
         
         	[Enter Widow and DIANA]
         
         		   What woman's that?
         
         DIANA	I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
         	Derived from the ancient Capilet:
         	My suit, as I do understand, you know,
         	And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
         
         Widow	I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
         	Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
         	And both shall cease, without your remedy.
         
         KING	Come hither, count; do you know these women?
         
         BERTRAM	My lord, I neither can nor will deny
         	But that I know them: do they charge me further?
         
         DIANA	Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
         
         BERTRAM	She's none of mine, my lord.
         
         DIANA	If you shall marry,
         	You give away this hand, and that is mine;
         	You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
         	You give away myself, which is known mine;
         	For I by vow am so embodied yours,
         	That she which marries you must marry me,
         	Either both or none.
         
         LAFEU	Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you
         	are no husband for her.
         
         BERTRAM	My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
         	Whom sometime I have laughed with: let your highness
         	Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
         	Than for to think that I would sink it here.
         
         KING	Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
         	Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
         	Than in my thought it lies.
         
         DIANA	Good my lord,
         	Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
         	He had not my virginity.
         
         KING	What sayest thou to her?
         
         BERTRAM	She's impudent, my lord,
         	And was a common gamester to the camp.
         
         DIANA	He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
         	He might have bought me at a common price:
         	Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
         	Whose high respect and rich validity
         	Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
         	He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
         	If I be one.
         
         COUNTESS	                  He blushes, and 'tis it:
         	Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
         	Conferred by testament to the sequent issue,
         	Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
         	That ring's a thousand proofs.
         
         KING	Methought you said
         	You saw one here in court could witness it.
         
         DIANA	I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
         	So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.
         
         LAFEU	I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
         
         KING	Find him, and bring him hither.
         
         	[Exit an Attendant]
         
         BERTRAM	What of him?
         	He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
         	With all the spots o' the world taxed and deboshed;
         	Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
         	Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
         	That will speak any thing?
         
         KING	She hath that ring of yours.
         
         BERTRAM	I think she has: certain it is I d her,
         	And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:
         	She knew her distance and did angle for me,
         	Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
         	As all impediments in fancy's course
         	Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
         	Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
         	Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
         	And I had that which any inferior might
         	At market-price have bought.
         
         DIANA	I must be patient:
         	You, that have turned off a first so noble wife,
         	May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
         	Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
         	Send for your ring, I will return it home,
         	And give me mine again.
         
         BERTRAM	I have it not.
         
         KING	What ring was yours, I pray you?
         
         DIANA	Sir, much 
         	The same upon your finger.
         
         KING	Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.
         
         DIANA	And this was it I gave him, being abed.
         
         KING	The story then goes false, you threw it him
         	Out of a casement.
         
         DIANA	                  I have spoke the truth.
         
         	[Enter PAROLLES]
         
         BERTRAM	My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
         
         KING	You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
         	Is this the man you speak of?
         
         DIANA	Ay, my lord.
         
         KING	Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
         	Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
         	Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
         	By him and by this woman here what know you?
         
         PAROLLES	So please your majesty, my master hath been an
         	honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,
         	which gentlemen have.
         
         KING	Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?
         
         PAROLLES	Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
         
         KING	How, I pray you?
         
         PAROLLES	He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
         
         KING	How is that?
         
         PAROLLES	He loved her, sir, and loved her not.
         
         KING	As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
         	equivocal companion is this!
         
         PAROLLES	I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.
         
         LAFEU	He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
         
         DIANA	Do you know he promised me marriage?
         
         PAROLLES	Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
         
         KING	But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?
         
         PAROLLES	Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,
         	as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for
         	indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and
         	of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
         	was in that credit with them at that time that I
         	knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,
         	as promising her marriage, and things which would
         	derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not
         	speak what I know.
         
         KING	Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say
         	they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
         	evidence; therefore stand aside.
         	This ring, you say, was yours?
         
         DIANA	Ay, my good lord.
         
         KING	Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?
         
         DIANA	It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
         
         KING	Who lent it you?
         
         DIANA	                  It was not lent me neither.
         
         KING	Where did you find it, then?
         
         DIANA	I found it not.
         
         KING	If it were yours by none of all these ways,
         	How could you give it him?
         
         DIANA	I never gave it him.
         
         LAFEU	This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off
         	and on at pleasure.
         
         KING	This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.
         
         DIANA	It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
         
         KING	Take her away; I do not  her now;
         	To prison with her: and away with him.
         	Unless thou tellest me where thou hadst this ring,
         	Thou diest within this hour.
         
         DIANA	I'll never tell you.
         
         KING	Take her away.
         
         DIANA	                  I'll put in bail, my liege.
         
         KING	I think thee now some common customer.
         
         DIANA	By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
         
         KING	Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?
         
         DIANA	Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:
         	He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
         	I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
         	Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
         	I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.
         
         KING	She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.
         
         DIANA	Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:
         
         	[Exit Widow]
         
         	The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
         	And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
         	Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
         	Though yet he never harmed me, here I quit him:
         	He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
         	And at that time he got his wife with child:
         	Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
         	So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
         	And now behold the meaning.
         
         	[Re-enter Widow, with HELENA]
         
         KING	Is there no exorcist
         	Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
         	Is't real that I see?
         
         HELENA	No, my good lord;
         	'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
         	The name and not the thing.
         
         BERTRAM	Both, both. O, pardon!
         
         HELENA	O my good lord, when I was  this maid,
         	I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
         	And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
         	'When from my finger you can get this ring
         	And are by me with child,' &amp;c. This is done:
         	Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?
         
         BERTRAM	If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
         	I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
         
         HELENA	If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
         	Deadly divorce step between me and you!
         	O my dear mother, do I see you living?
         
         LAFEU	Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:
         
         	[To PAROLLES]
         
         	Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
         	I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:
         	Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.
         
         KING	Let us from point to point this story know,
         	To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
         
         	[To DIANA]
         
         	If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower,
         	Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
         	For I can guess that by thy honest aid
         	Thou keepest a wife herself, thyself a maid.
         	Of that and all the progress, more or less,
         	Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
         	All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
         	The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

         KING	The king's a beggar, now the play is done:
         	All is well ended, if this suit be won,
         	That you express content; which we will pay,
         	With strife to please you, day exceeding day:

         SCENE I	Orchard of Oliver's house.
         
         
         	[Enter ORLANDO and ADAM]
         
         ORLANDO	As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
         	bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
         	and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
         	blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
         	sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
         	report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
         	he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
         	properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
         	that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
         	differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
         	are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
         	with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
         	and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
         	brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
         	which his animals on his dunghills are as much
         	bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
         	plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
         	me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
         	me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
         	brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
         	gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
         	grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
         	think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
         	servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
         	know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
         
         ADAM	Yonder comes my master, your brother.
         
         ORLANDO	Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
         	shake me up.
         
         	[Enter OLIVER]
         
         OLIVER	Now, sir! what make you here?
         
         ORLANDO	Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
         
         OLIVER	What mar you then, sir?
         
         ORLANDO	Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
         	made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
         
         OLIVER	Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
         
         ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
         	What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
         	come to such penury?
         
         OLIVER	Know you where your are, sir?
         
         ORLANDO	O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
         
         OLIVER	Know you before whom, sir?
         
         ORLANDO	Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
         	you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
         	condition of blood, you should so know me. The
         	courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
         	you are the first-born; but the same tradition
         	takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
         	betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
         	you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
         	nearer to his reverence.
         
         OLIVER	What, boy!
         
         ORLANDO	Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
         
         OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
         
         ORLANDO	I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
         	Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
         	a villain that says such a father begot villains.
         	Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
         	from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
         	tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
         
         ADAM	Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
         	remembrance, be at accord.
         
         OLIVER	Let me go, I say.
         
         ORLANDO	I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
         	father charged you in his will to give me good
         	education: you have trained me  a peasant,
         	obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-
         	qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
         	me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
         	me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
         	give me the poor allottery my father left me by
         	testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
         
         OLIVER	And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
         	Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
         	with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
         	pray you, leave me.
         
         ORLANDO	I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
         
         OLIVER	Get you with him, you old dog.
         
         ADAM	Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
         	teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
         	he would not have spoke such a word.
         
         	[Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM]
         
         OLIVER	Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
         	physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
         	crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!
         
         	[Enter DENNIS]

         DENNIS	So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
         	access to you.

         CHARLES	Good morrow to your worship.
         
         OLIVER	Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
         	new court?
         
         CHARLES	There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
         	that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
         	brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
         	have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
         	whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
         	therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
         
         OLIVER	Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
         	banished with her father?
         
         CHARLES	O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
         	her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
         	that she would have followed her exile, or have died
         	to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
         	less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
         	never two ladies loved as they do.
         
         OLIVER	Where will the old duke live?
         
         CHARLES	They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
         	a many merry men with him; and there they live 
         	the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
         	gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
         	carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
         
         OLIVER	What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
         
         CHARLES	Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
         	matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
         	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
         	to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
         	To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
         	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
         	well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
         	for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
         	must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
         	out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
         	withal, that either you might stay him from his
         	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
         	run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
         	and altogether against my will.
         
         OLIVER	Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
         	thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
         	myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
         	have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
         	it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
         	it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
         	of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
         	good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
         	me his natural brother: therefore use thy
         	discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
         	as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
         	thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
         	mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
         	against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
         	treacherous device and never leave thee till he
         	hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
         	for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
         	it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
         	day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
         	should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
         	blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
         
         CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
         	to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
         	alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
         	so God keep your worship!
         
         OLIVER	Farewell, good Charles.
         
         	[Exit CHARLES]
         
         	Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
         	an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
         	hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
         	schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
         	all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
         	in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
         	people, who best know him, that I am altogether
         	misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
         	wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
         	I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.

         CELIA	I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
         
         ROSALIND	Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
         	and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
         	teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
         	learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
         
         CELIA	Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
         	that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
         	had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
         	hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
         	love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,

         	tempered as mine is to thee.
         
         ROSALIND	Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
         	rejoice in yours.
         
         CELIA	You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
         	 to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
         	be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
         	father perforce, I will render thee again in
         	affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
         	that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
         	sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
         
         ROSALIND	From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
         	me see; what think you of falling in love?
         
         CELIA	Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
         	love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
         	neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
         	in honour come off again.
         
         ROSALIND	What shall be our sport, then?
         
         CELIA	Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
         	her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
         
         ROSALIND	I would we could do so, for her benefits are
         	mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
         	doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
         
         CELIA	'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
         	makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
         	makes very ill-favouredly.
         
         ROSALIND	Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
         	Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
         	not in the lineaments of Nature.
         
         	[Enter TOUCHSTONE]
         
         CELIA	No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
         	not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
         	hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
         	Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
         
         ROSALIND	Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
         	Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
         	Nature's wit.
         
         CELIA	Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
         	Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
         	to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
         	natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
         	the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
         	wit! whither wander you?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Mistress, you must come away to your father.
         
         CELIA	Were you made the messenger?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.
         
         ROSALIND	Where learned you that oath, fool?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
         	were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
         	mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
         	pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
         	yet was not the knight forsworn.
         
         CELIA	How prove you that, in the great heap of your
         	knowledge?
         
         ROSALIND	Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
         	swear by your beards that I am a knave.
         
         CELIA	By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
         	swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
         	more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
         	never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
         	before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
         
         CELIA	Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
         
         CELIA	My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
         	speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
         	one of these days.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
         	wise men do foolishly.
         
         CELIA	By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
         	wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
         	that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
         	Monsieur Le Beau.
         
         ROSALIND	With his mouth full of news.
         
         CELIA	Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.
         
         ROSALIND	Then shall we be news-crammed.
         
         CELIA	All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
         
         	[Enter LE BEAU]
         
         	Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?
         
         LE BEAU	Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
         
         CELIA	Sport! of what colour?
         
         LE BEAU	What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?
         
         ROSALIND	As wit and fortune will.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Or as the Destinies decree.
         
         CELIA	Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Nay, if I keep not my rank,--
         
         ROSALIND	Thou losest thy old smell.
         
         LE BEAU	You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
         	wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
         
         ROSALIND	You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
         
         LE BEAU	I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
         	your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
         	yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
         	to perform it.
         
         CELIA	Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
         
         LE BEAU	There comes an old man and his three sons,--
         
         CELIA	I could match this beginning with an old tale.
         
         LE BEAU	Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
         
         ROSALIND	With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
         	by these presents.'
         
         LE BEAU	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
         	duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
         	and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
         	hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
         	so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
         	their father, making such pitiful dole over them
         	that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
         
         ROSALIND	Alas!
         
         TOUCHSTONE	But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
         	have lost?
         
         LE BEAU	Why, this that I speak of.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
         	time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
         	for ladies.
         
         CELIA	Or I, I promise thee.
         
         ROSALIND	But is there any else longs to see this broken music
         	in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
         	rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
         
         LE BEAU	You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
         	appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
         	perform it.
         
         CELIA	Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.
         
         	[Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO,
         	CHARLES, and Attendants]
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
         	own peril on his forwardness.
         
         ROSALIND	Is yonder the man?
         
         LE BEAU	Even he, madam.
         
         CELIA	Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
         	to see the wrestling?
         
         ROSALIND	Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
         	there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
         	challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
         	will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
         	you can move him.
         
         CELIA	Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	Do so: I'll not be by.
         
         LE BEAU	Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.
         
         ORLANDO	I attend them with all respect and duty.
         
         ROSALIND	Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?
         
         ORLANDO	No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
         	come but in, as others do, to try with him the
         	strength of my youth.
         
         CELIA	Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
         	years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
         	strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
         	knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
         	adventure would counsel you to a more equal
         	enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
         	embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
         
         ROSALIND	Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
         	be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
         	that the wrestling might not go forward.
         
         ORLANDO	I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
         	thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
         	so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
         	your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
         	trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
         	shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
         	dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
         	friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
         	world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
         	the world I fill up a place, which may be better
         	supplied when I have made it empty.
         
         ROSALIND	The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
         
         CELIA	And mine, to eke out hers.
         
         ROSALIND	Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
         
         CELIA	Your heart's desires be with you!
         
         CHARLES	Come, where is this young gallant that is so
         	desirous to lie with his mother earth?
         
         ORLANDO	Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	You shall try but one fall.
         
         CHARLES	No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
         	to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
         	from a first.
         
         ORLANDO	An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
         	mocked me before: but come your ways.
         
         ROSALIND	Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!
         
         CELIA	I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
         	fellow by the leg.
         
         	[They wrestle]
         
         ROSALIND	O excellent young man!
         
         CELIA	If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
         	should down.
         
         	[Shout. CHARLES is thrown]
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	No more, no more.
         
         ORLANDO	Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	How dost thou, Charles?
         
         LE BEAU	He cannot speak, my lord.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
         
         ORLANDO	Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
         	The world esteemed thy father honourable,
         	But I did find him still mine enemy:
         	Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
         	Hadst thou descended from another house.
         	But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
         	I would thou hadst told me of another father.
         
         	[Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU]
         
         CELIA	Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
         
         ORLANDO	I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
         	His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
         	To be adopted heir to Frederick.
         
         ROSALIND	My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
         	And all the world was of my father's mind:
         	Had I before known this young man his son,
         	I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
         	Ere he should thus have ventured.
         
         CELIA	Gentle cousin,
         	Let us go thank him and encourage him:
         	My father's rough and envious disposition
         	Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
         	If you do keep your promises in love
         	But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
         	Your mistress shall be happy.
         
         ROSALIND	Gentleman,
         
         	[Giving him a chain from her neck]
         
         	Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
         	That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
         	Shall we go, coz?
         
         CELIA	                  Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
         
         ORLANDO	Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
         	Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
         	Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
         
         ROSALIND	He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
         	I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
         	Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
         	More than your enemies.
         
         CELIA	Will you go, coz?
         
         ROSALIND	Have with you. Fare you well.
         
         	[Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA]
         
         ORLANDO	What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
         	I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
         	O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
         	Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
         
         	[Re-enter LE BEAU]
         
         LE BEAU	Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
         	To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
         	High commendation, true applause and love,
         	Yet such is now the duke's condition
         	That he misconstrues all that you have done.
         	The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
         	More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
         
         ORLANDO	I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
         	Which of the two was daughter of the duke
         	That here was at the wrestling?
         
         LE BEAU	Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
         	But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
         	The other is daughter to the banished duke,
         	And here detained by her usurping uncle,
         	To keep his daughter company; whose loves
         	Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
         	But I can tell you that of late this duke
         	Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
         	Grounded upon no other argument
         	But that the people praise her for her virtues
         	And pity her for her good father's sake;
         	And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
         	Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
         	Hereafter, in a better world than this,
         	I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
         
         ORLANDO	I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
         
         	[Exit LE BEAU]
         
         	Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
         	From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
         	But heavenly Rosalind!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         
         
         
         	AS YOU  IT
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	A room in the palace.
         
         
         	[Enter CELIA and ROSALIND]
         
         CELIA	Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?
         
         ROSALIND	Not one to throw at a dog.
         
         CELIA	No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
         	curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
         
         ROSALIND	Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
         	should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
         	without any.
         
         CELIA	But is all this for your father?
         
         ROSALIND	No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
         	full of briers is this working-day world!
         
         CELIA	They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
         	holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
         	paths our very petticoats will catch them.
         
         ROSALIND	I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
         
         CELIA	Hem them away.
         
         ROSALIND	I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
         
         CELIA	Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
         
         ROSALIND	O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!
         
         CELIA	O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
         	despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
         	service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
         	possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
         	strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
         
         ROSALIND	The duke my father loved his father dearly.
         
         CELIA	Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
         	dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
         	for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
         	not Orlando.
         
         ROSALIND	No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
         
         CELIA	Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
         
         ROSALIND	Let me love him for that, and do you love him
         	because I do. Look, here comes the duke.
         
         CELIA	With his eyes full of anger.
         
         	[Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords]
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
         	And get you from our court.
         
         ROSALIND	Me, uncle?
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	You, cousin
         	Within these ten days if that thou beest found
         	So near our public court as twenty miles,
         	Thou diest for it.
         
         ROSALIND	                  I do beseech your grace,
         	Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
         	If with myself I hold intelligence
         	Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
         	If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
         	As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
         	Never so much as in a thought unborn
         	Did I offend your highness.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	Thus do all traitors:
         	If their purgation did consist in words,
         	They are as innocent as grace itself:
         	Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
         
         ROSALIND	Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
         	Tell me whereon the lihood depends.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
         
         ROSALIND	So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
         	So was I when your highness banished him:
         	Treason is not inherited, my lord;
         	Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
         	What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
         	Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
         	To think my poverty is treacherous.
         
         CELIA	Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	Ay, Celia; we stayed her for your sake,
         	Else had she with her father ranged along.
         
         CELIA	I did not then entreat to have her stay;
         	It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
         	I was too young that time to value her;
         	But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
         	Why so am I; we still have slept together,
         	Rose at an instant, learned, played, eat together,
         	And wheresoever we went,  Juno's swans,
         	Still we went coupled and inseparable.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
         	Her very silence and her patience
         	Speak to the people, and they pity her.
         	Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
         	And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
         	When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
         	Firm and irrevocable is my doom
         	Which I have passed upon her; she is banished.
         
         CELIA	Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
         	I cannot live out of her company.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
         	If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
         	And in the greatness of my word, you die.
         
         	[Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords]
         
         CELIA	O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
         	Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
         	I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
         
         ROSALIND	I have more cause.
         
         CELIA	                  Thou hast not, cousin;
         	Prithee be cheerful: knowest thou not, the duke
         	Hath banished me, his daughter?
         
         ROSALIND	That he hath not.
         
         CELIA	No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
         	Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
         	Shall we be sundered? shall we part, sweet girl?
         	No: let my father seek another heir.
         	Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
         	Whither to go and what to bear with us;
         	And do not seek to take your change upon you,
         	To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
         	For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
         	Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
         
         ROSALIND	Why, whither shall we go?
         
         CELIA	To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
         
         ROSALIND	Alas, what danger will it be to us,
         	Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
         	Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
         
         CELIA	I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
         	And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
         	The  do you: so shall we pass along
         	And never stir assailants.
         
         ROSALIND	Were it not better,
         	Because that I am more than common tall,
         	That I did suit me all points  a man?
         	A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
         	A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
         	Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
         	We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
         	As many other mannish cowards have
         	That do outface it with their semblances.
         
         CELIA	What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
         
         ROSALIND	I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
         	And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
         	But what will you be called?
         
         CELIA	Something that hath a reference to my state
         	No longer Celia, but Aliena.
         
         ROSALIND	But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal
         	The clownish fool out of your father's court?
         	Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
         
         CELIA	He'll go along over the wide world with me;
         	Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
         	And get our jewels and our wealth together,
         	Devise the fittest time and safest way
         	To hide us from pursuit that will be made
         	After my flight. Now go we in content
         	To liberty and not to banishment.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         SCENE I	The Forest of Arden.
         
         
         	[Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,
         	 foresters]
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
         	Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
         	Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
         	More free from peril than the envious court?
         	Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
         	The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
         	And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
         	Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
         	Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
         	'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
         	That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
         	Sweet are the uses of adversity,
         	Which,  the toad, ugly and venomous,
         	Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
         	And this our life exempt from public haunt
         	Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
         	Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
         	I would not change it.
         
         AMIENS	Happy is your grace,
         	That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
         	Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
         	And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
         	Being native burghers of this desert city,
         	Should in their own confines with forked heads
         	Have their round haunches gored.
         
         First Lord	Indeed, my lord,
         	The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
         	And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
         	Than doth your brother that hath banished you.
         	To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
         	Did steal behind him as he lay along
         	Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
         	Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
         	To the which place a poor sequestered stag,
         	That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
         	Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
         	The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
         	That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
         	Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
         	Coursed one another down his innocent nose
         	In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
         	Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
         	Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
         	Augmenting it with tears.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	But what said Jaques?
         	Did he not moralize this spectacle?
         
         First Lord	O, yes, into a thousand similes.
         	First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
         	'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
         	As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
         	To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
         	Left and abandoned of his velvet friends,
         	''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
         	The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
         	Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
         	And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
         	'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
         	'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
         	Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
         	Thus most invectively he pierceth through
         	The body of the country, city, court,
         	Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
         	Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
         	To fright the animals and to kill them up
         	In their assigned and native dwelling-place.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	And did you leave him in this contemplation?
         
         Second Lord	We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
         	Upon the sobbing deer.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Show me the place:
         	I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
         	For then he's full of matter.
         
         First Lord	I'll bring you to him straight.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         SCENE 	A room in the palace.
         
         
         	[Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords]
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	Can it be possible that no man saw them?
         	It cannot be: some villains of my court
         	Are of consent and sufferance in this.
         
         First Lord	I cannot hear of any that did see her.
         	The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
         	Saw her abed, and in the morning early
         	They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
         
         Second Lord	My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
         	Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
         	Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,
         	Confesses that she secretly overheard
         	Your daughter and her cousin much commend
         	The parts and graces of the wrestler
         	That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
         	And she believes, wherever they are gone,
         	That youth is surely in their company.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
         	If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
         	I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
         	And let not search and inquisition quail
         	To bring again these foolish runaways.

         	[Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting]
         
         ORLANDO	Who's there?
         
         ADAM	What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
         	O my sweet master! O you memory
         	Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
         	Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
         	And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
         	Why would you be so fond to overcome
         	The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
         	Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
         	Know you not, master, to some kind of men
         	Their graces serve them but as enemies?
         	No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
         	Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
         	O, what a world is this, when what is comely
         	Envenoms him that bears it!
         
         ORLANDO	Why, what's the matter?
         
         ADAM	O unhappy youth!
         	Come not within these doors; within this roof
         	The enemy of all your graces lives:
         	Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
         	Yet not the son, I will not call him son
         	Of him I was about to call his father--
         	Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
         	To burn the lodging where you use to lie
         	And you within it: if he fail of that,
         	He will have other means to cut you off.
         	I overheard him and his practises.
         	This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
         	Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
         
         ORLANDO	Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
         
         ADAM	No matter whither, so you come not here.
         
         ORLANDO	What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
         	Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
         	A thievish living on the common road?
         	This I must do, or know not what to do:
         	Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
         	I rather will subject me to the malice
         	Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
         
         ADAM	But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
         	The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
         	Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
         	When service should in my old limbs lie lame
         	And unregarded age in corners thrown:
         	Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
         	Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
         	Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
         	And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
         	Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
         	For in my youth I never did apply
         	Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
         	Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
         	The means of weakness and debility;
         	Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
         	Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
         	I'll do the service of a younger man
         	In all your business and necessities.
         
         ORLANDO	O good old man, how well in thee appears
         	The constant service of the antique world,
         	When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
         	Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
         	Where none will sweat but for promotion,
         	And having that, do choke their service up
         	Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
         	But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
         	That cannot so much as a blossom yield
         	In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
         	But come thy ways; well go along together,
         	And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
         	We'll light upon some settled low content.
         
         ADAM	Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
         	To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
         	From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
         	Here lived I, but now live here no more.
         	At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
         	But at fourscore it is too late a week:
         	Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
         	Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

         ROSALIND	I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
         	apparel and to cry  a woman; but I must comfort
         	the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show
         	itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,
         	good Aliena!

         	for I think you have no money in your purse.
         
         ROSALIND	Well, this is the forest of Arden.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was
         	at home, I was in a better place: but travellers
         	must be content.
         
         ROSALIND	Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
         
         	[Enter CORIN and SILVIUS]
         
         	Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in
         	solemn talk.
         
         CORIN	That is the way to make her scorn you still.
         
         SILVIUS	O Corin, that thou knewest how I do love her!
         
         CORIN	I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.
         
         SILVIUS	No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
         	Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
         	As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow:
         	But if thy love were ever  to mine--
         	As sure I think did never man love so--
         	How many actions most ridiculous
         	Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
         
         CORIN	Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
         
         SILVIUS	O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
         	If thou rememberest not the slightest folly
         	That ever love did make thee run into,
         	Thou hast not loved:
         	Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
         	Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
         	Thou hast not loved:
         	Or if thou hast not broke from company
         	Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
         	Thou hast not loved.
         	O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         ROSALIND	Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
         	I have by hard adventure found mine own.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke
         	my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
         	coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the
         	kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
         	pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the
         	wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took
         	two cods and, giving her them again, said with
         	weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
         	true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is
         	mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
         
         ROSALIND	Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Nay, I shall never be ware of mine own wit till I
         	break my shins against it.
         
         ROSALIND	Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
         	Is much upon my fashion.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
         
         CELIA	I pray you, one of you question yond man
         	If he for gold will give us any food:
         	I faint almost to death.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Holla, you clown!
         
         ROSALIND	Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.
         
         CORIN	Who calls?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Your betters, sir.
         
         CORIN	                  Else are they very wretched.
         
         ROSALIND	Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
         
         CORIN	And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
         
         ROSALIND	I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
         	Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
         	Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
         	Here's a young maid with travel much oppressed
         	And faints for succor.
         
         CORIN	Fair sir, I pity her
         	And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
         	My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
         	But I am shepherd to another man
         	And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
         	My master is of churlish disposition
         	And little recks to find the way to heaven
         	By doing deeds of hospitality:
         	Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed
         	Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
         	By reason of his absence, there is nothing
         	That you will feed on; but what is, come see.
         	And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
         
         ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
         
         CORIN	That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
         	That little cares for buying any thing.
         
         ROSALIND	I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
         	Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,
         	And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
         
         CELIA	And we will mend thy wages. I  this place.
         	And willingly could waste my time in it.
         
         CORIN	Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
         	Go with me: if you  upon report
         	The soil, the profit and this kind of life,
         	I will your very faithful feeder be
         	And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

         	[Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and others]
         	
         	SONG.
         AMIENS	Under the greenwood tree
         	Who loves to lie with me,
         	And turn his merry note
         	Unto the sweet bird's throat,
         	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
         	Here shall he see No enemy
         	But winter and rough weather.
         
         JAQUES	More, more, I prithee, more.
         
         AMIENS	It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
         
         JAQUES	I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
         	melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
         	More, I prithee, more.
         
         AMIENS	My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.
         
         JAQUES	I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to
         	sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?
         
         AMIENS	What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
         
         JAQUES	Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me
         	nothing. Will you sing?
         
         AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself.
         
         JAQUES	Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;
         	but that they call compliment is  the encounter
         	of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
         	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
         	the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will
         	not, hold your tongues.
         
         AMIENS	Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the
         	duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
         	this day to look you.
         
         JAQUES	And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
         	too disputable for my company: I think of as many
         	matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
         	boast of them. Come, warble, come.
         	
         	SONG.
         	Who doth ambition shun
         
         	[All together here]
         
         	And loves to live i' the sun,
         	Seeking the food he eats
         	And pleased with what he gets,
         	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
         	Here shall he see No enemy
         	But winter and rough weather.
         
         JAQUES	I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
         	yesterday in despite of my invention.
         
         AMIENS	And I'll sing it.
         
         JAQUES	Thus it goes:--
         
         	If it do come to pass
         	That any man turn ass,
         	Leaving his wealth and ease,
         	A stubborn will to please,
         	Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
         	Here shall he see
         	Gross fools as he,
         	An if he will come to me.
         
         AMIENS	What's that educdame'?
         
         JAQUES	'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
         	circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll
         	rail against all the first-born of Egypt.
         
         AMIENS	And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.
         
         	[Exeunt severally]

         ADAM	Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!
         	Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
         	kind master.
         
         ORLANDO	Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live
         	a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
         	If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I
         	will either be food for it or bring it for food to
         	thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
         	For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at
         	the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;
         	and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
         	give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
         	come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
         	thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.
         	Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
         	thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for
         	lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this
         	desert. Cheerly, good Adam!

         	Lords  outlaws]
         
         DUKE SENIOR	I think he be transformed into a beast;
         	For I can no where find him  a man.
         
         First Lord	My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
         	Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
         	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
         	Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.
         
         	[Enter JAQUES]
         
         First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
         	That your poor friends must woo your company?
         	What, you look merrily!
         
         JAQUES	A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
         	A motley fool; a miserable world!
         	As I do live by food, I met a fool
         	Who laid him down and basked him in the sun,
         	And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,
         	In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
         	'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
         	'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
         	And then he drew a dial from his poke,
         	And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
         	Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
         	Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
         	'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
         	And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
         	And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
         	And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
         	And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
         	The motley fool thus moral on the time,
         	My lungs began to crow  chanticleer,
         	That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
         	And I did laugh sans intermission
         	An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
         	A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?
         
         JAQUES	O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
         	And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
         	They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
         	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
         	After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed
         	With observation, the which he vents
         	In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
         	I am ambitious for a motley coat.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one.
         
         JAQUES	It is my only suit;
         	Provided that you weed your better judgments
         	Of all opinion that grows rank in them
         	That I am wise. I must have liberty
         	Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
         	To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
         	And they that are most galled with my folly,
         	They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
         	The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
         	He that a fool doth very wisely hit
         	Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
         	Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
         	The wise man's folly is anatomized
         	Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
         	Invest me in my motley; give me leave
         	To speak my mind, and I will through and through
         	Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
         	If they will patiently receive my medicine.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
         
         JAQUES	What, for a counter, would I do but good?
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
         	For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
         	As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
         	And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
         	That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
         	Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
         
         JAQUES	Why, who cries out on pride,
         	That can therein tax any private party?
         	Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
         	Till that the weary very means do ebb?
         	What woman in the city do I name,
         	When that I say the city-woman bears
         	The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
         	Who can come in and say that I mean her,
         	When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
         	Or what is he of basest function
         	That says his bravery is not of my cost,
         	Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
         	His folly to the mettle of my speech?
         	There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
         	My tongue hath wronged him: if it do him right,
         	Then he hath wronged himself; if he be free,
         	Why then my taxing  a wild-goose flies,
         	Unclaimed of any man. But who comes here?
         
         	[Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn]
         
         ORLANDO	Forbear, and eat no more.
         
         JAQUES	Why, I have eat none yet.
         
         ORLANDO	Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.
         
         JAQUES	Of what kind should this cock come of?
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress,
         	Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
         	That in civility thou seemest so empty?
         
         ORLANDO	You touched my vein at first: the thorny point
         	Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
         	Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
         	And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
         	He dies that touches any of this fruit
         	Till I and my affairs are answered.
         
         JAQUES	An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
         	More than your force move us to gentleness.
         
         ORLANDO	I almost die for food; and let me have it.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
         
         ORLANDO	Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
         	I thought that all things had been savage here;
         	And therefore put I on the countenance
         	Of stern commandment. But whatever you are
         	That in this desert inaccessible,
         	Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
         	Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
         	If ever you have looked on better days,
         	If ever been where bells have knolled to church,
         	If ever sat at any good man's feast,
         	If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
         	And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
         	Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
         	In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	True is it that we have seen better days,
         	And have with holy bell been knolled to church
         	And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
         	Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered:
         	And therefore sit you down in gentleness
         	And take upon command what help we have
         	That to your wanting may be ministered.
         
         ORLANDO	Then but forbear your food a little while,
         	Whiles,  a doe, I go to find my fawn
         	And give it food. There is an old poor man,
         	Who after me hath many a weary step
         	Limped in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
         	Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger,
         	I will not touch a bit.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Go find him out,
         	And we will nothing waste till you return.
         
         ORLANDO	I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
         
         	[Exit]
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
         	This wide and universal theatre
         	Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
         	Wherein we play in.
         
         JAQUES	All the world's a stage,
         	And all the men and women merely players:
         	They have their exits and their entrances;
         	And one man in his time plays many parts,
         	His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
         	Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
         	And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
         	And shining morning face, creeping  snail
         	Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
         	Sighing  furnace, with a woeful ballad
         	Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
         	Full of strange oaths and bearded  the pard,
         	Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
         	Seeking the bubble reputation
         	Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
         	In fair round belly with good capon lined,
         	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
         	Full of wise saws and modern instances;
         	And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
         	Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
         	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
         	His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
         	For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
         	Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
         	And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
         	That ends this strange eventful history,
         	Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
         	Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
         
         	[Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM]
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
         	And let him feed.
         
         ORLANDO	I thank you most for him.
         
         ADAM	So had you need:
         	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
         	As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
         	Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
         	
         	SONG.
         AMIENS	Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
         	Thou art not so unkind
         	As man's ingratitude;
         	Thy tooth is not so keen,
         	Because thou art not seen,
         	Although thy breath be rude.
         	Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
         	Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
         	Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
         	This life is most jolly.
         	Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
         	That dost not bite so nigh
         	As benefits forgot:
         	Though thou the waters warp,
         	Thy sting is not so sharp
         	As friend remembered not.
         	Heigh-ho! sing, &amp;c.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
         	As you have whispered faithfully you were,
         	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
         	Most truly limned and living in your face,
         	Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
         	That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
         	Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
         	Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
         	Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
         	And let me all your fortunes understand.

         DUKE FREDERICK	Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
         	But were I not the better part made mercy,
         	I should not seek an absent argument
         	Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
         	Find out thy brother, wheresoever he is;
         	Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
         	Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
         	To seek a living in our territory.
         	Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
         	Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
         	Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
         	Of what we think against thee.
         
         OLIVER	O that your highness knew my heart in this!
         	I never loved my brother in my life.
         
         DUKE FREDERICK	More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
         	And let my officers of such a nature
         	Make an extent upon his house and lands:
         	Do this expediently and turn him going.

         	O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
         	And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;
         	That every eye which in this forest looks
         	Shall see thy virtue witnessed every where.

         	[Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE]
         
         CORIN	And how  you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
         	life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,
         	it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
         	 it very well; but in respect that it is
         	private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
         	is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
         	respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
         	is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
         	but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
         	against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
         
         CORIN	No more but that I know the more one sickens the
         	worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
         	means and content is without three good friends;
         	that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
         	burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
         	great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
         	he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
         	complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
         	court, shepherd?
         
         CORIN	No, truly.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Then thou art damned.
         
         CORIN	Nay, I hope.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Truly, thou art damned  an ill-roasted egg, all
         	on one side.
         
         CORIN	For not being at court? Your reason.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
         	good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
         	then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
         	sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
         	state, shepherd.
         
         CORIN	Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
         	at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
         	behavior of the country is most mockable at the
         	court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
         	you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
         	uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Instance, briefly; come, instance.
         
         CORIN	Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
         	fells, you know, are greasy.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
         	the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
         	a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
         
         CORIN	Besides, our hands are hard.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
         	A more sounder instance, come.
         
         CORIN	And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
         	our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
         	courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
         	good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
         	perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
         	very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
         
         CORIN	You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
         	God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
         
         CORIN	Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
         	that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
         	happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
         	harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
         	graze and my lambs suck.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
         	and the rams together and to offer to get your
         	living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
         	bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
         	twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
         	out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
         	damned for this, the devil himself will have no
         	shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
         	'scape.
         
         CORIN	Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.

         ROSALIND	     From the east to western Ind,
         	No jewel is  Rosalind.
         	Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
         	Through all the world bears Rosalind.
         	All the pictures fairest lined
         	Are but black to Rosalind.
         	Let no fair be kept in mind
         	But the fair of Rosalind.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and
         	suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
         	right butter-women's rank to market.
         
         ROSALIND	Out, fool!
         
         TOUCHSTONE	For a taste:
         	If a hart do lack a hind,
         	Let him seek out Rosalind.
         	If the cat will after kind,
         	So be sure will Rosalind.
         	Winter garments must be lined,
         	So must slender Rosalind.
         	They that reap must sheaf and bind;
         	Then to cart with Rosalind.
         	Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
         	Such a nut is Rosalind.
         	He that sweetest rose will find
         	Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
         	This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
         	infect yourself with them?
         
         ROSALIND	Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
         
         ROSALIND	I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
         	with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
         	i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
         	ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the
         	forest judge.
         
         	[Enter CELIA, with a writing]

         CELIA	[Reads]
         
         	Why should this a desert be?
         	For it is unpeopled? No:
         	Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
         	That shall civil sayings show:
         	Some, how brief the life of man
         	Runs his erring pilgrimage,
         	That the stretching of a span
         	Buckles in his sum of age;
         	Some, of violated vows
         	'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
         	But upon the fairest boughs,
         	Or at every sentence end,
         	Will I Rosalinda write,
         	Teaching all that read to know
         	The quintessence of every sprite
         	Heaven would in little show.
         	Therefore Heaven Nature charged
         	That one body should be filled
         	With all graces wide-enlarged:
         	Nature presently distilled
         	Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
         	Cleopatra's majesty,
         	Atalanta's better part,
         	Sad Lucretia's modesty.
         	Thus Rosalind of many parts
         	By heavenly synod was devised,
         	Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
         	To have the touches dearest prized.
         	Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
         	And I to live and die her slave.

         	Go with him, sirrah.

         	though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
         
         	[Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE]
         
         CELIA	Didst thou hear these verses?
         
         ROSALIND	O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of
         	them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
         
         CELIA	That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.
         
         ROSALIND	Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
         	themselves without the verse and therefore stood
         	lamely in the verse.
         
         CELIA	But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
         	should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
         
         ROSALIND	I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
         	before you came; for look here what I found on a
         	palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
         	Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I
         	can hardly remember.

         	meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
         	and so encounter.
         
         ROSALIND	Nay, but who is it?
         
         CELIA	Is it possible?
         
         ROSALIND	Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,
         	tell me who it is.
         
         CELIA	O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
         	wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
         	out of all hooping!
         
         ROSALIND	Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
         	caparisoned  a man, I have a doublet and hose in
         	my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
         	South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it
         	quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
         	stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
         	out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
         	mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at
         	all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that
         	may drink thy tidings.
         
         CELIA	So you may put a man in your belly.
         
         ROSALIND	Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his
         	head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?
         
         CELIA	Nay, he hath but a little beard.
         
         ROSALIND	Why, God will send more, if the man will be
         	thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if
         	thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
         
         CELIA	It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's
         	heels and your heart both in an instant.
         
         ROSALIND	Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and
         	true maid.
         
         CELIA	I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
         
         ROSALIND	Orlando?
         
         CELIA	Orlando.
         
         ROSALIND	Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and
         	hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
         	he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
         	him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
         	How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
         	him again? Answer me in one word.
         
         CELIA	You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
         	word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
         	say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
         	answer in a catechism.
         
         ROSALIND	But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
         	man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
         	day he wrestled?
         
         CELIA	It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
         	propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
         	finding him, and relish it with good observance.
         	I found him under a tree,  a dropped acorn.
         
         ROSALIND	It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops
         	forth such fruit.
         
         CELIA	Give me audience, good madam.
         
         ROSALIND	Proceed.
         
         CELIA	There lay he, stretched along,  a wounded knight.
         
         ROSALIND	Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
         	becomes the ground.
         
         CELIA	Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
         	unseasonably. He was furnished  a hunter.
         
         ROSALIND	O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
         
         CELIA	I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
         	me out of tune.
         
         ROSALIND	Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must
         	speak. Sweet, say on.
         
         CELIA	You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
         
         	[Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES]
         
         ROSALIND	'Tis he: slink by, and note him.
         
         JAQUES	I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had
         	as lief have been myself alone.
         
         ORLANDO	And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
         	too for your society.
         
         JAQUES	God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
         
         ORLANDO	I do desire we may be better strangers.
         
         JAQUES	I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
         	love-songs in their barks.
         
         ORLANDO	I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
         	them ill-favouredly.
         
         JAQUES	Rosalind is your love's name?
         
         ORLANDO	Yes, just.
         
         JAQUES	I do not  her name.
         
         ORLANDO	There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
         	christened.
         
         JAQUES	What stature is she of?
         
         ORLANDO	Just as high as my heart.
         
         JAQUES	You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
         	acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
         	out of rings?
         
         ORLANDO	Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from
         	whence you have studied your questions.
         
         JAQUES	You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
         	Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
         	we two will rail against our mistress the world and
         	all our misery.
         
         ORLANDO	I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
         	against whom I know most faults.
         
         JAQUES	The worst fault you have is to be in love.
         
         ORLANDO	'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
         	I am weary of you.
         
         JAQUES	By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
         	you.
         
         ORLANDO	He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
         	shall see him.
         
         JAQUES	There I shall see mine own figure.
         
         ORLANDO	Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
         
         JAQUES	I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
         	Signior Love.
         
         ORLANDO	I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
         	Melancholy.
         
         	[Exit JAQUES]
         
         ROSALIND	[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him,  a saucy
         	lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
         	Do you hear, forester?
         
         ORLANDO	Very well: what would you?
         
         ROSALIND	I pray you, what is't o'clock?
         
         ORLANDO	You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
         	in the forest.
         
         ROSALIND	Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
         	sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
         	detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
         
         ORLANDO	And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
         	been as proper?
         
         ROSALIND	By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
         	divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
         	withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
         	withal and who he stands still withal.
         
         ORLANDO	I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
         
         ROSALIND	Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
         	contract of her marriage and the day it is
         	solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
         	Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
         	seven year.
         
         ORLANDO	Who ambles Time withal?
         
         ROSALIND	With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
         	hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
         	he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
         	he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
         	and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
         	of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.
         
         ORLANDO	Who doth he gallop withal?
         
         ROSALIND	With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
         	softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
         
         ORLANDO	Who stays it still withal?
         
         ROSALIND	With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
         	term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
         
         ORLANDO	Where dwell you, pretty youth?
         
         ROSALIND	With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
         	skirts of the forest,  fringe upon a petticoat.
         
         ORLANDO	Are you native of this place?
         
         ROSALIND	As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
         
         ORLANDO	Your accent is something finer than you could
         	purchase in so removed a dwelling.
         
         ROSALIND	I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
         	religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
         	in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
         	too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
         	him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
         	I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
         	giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
         	whole sex withal.
         
         ORLANDO	Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
         	laid to the charge of women?
         
         ROSALIND	There were none principal; they were all  one
         	another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
         	monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
         
         ORLANDO	I prithee, recount some of them.
         
         ROSALIND	No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
         	are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
         	abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
         	their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
         	on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
         	Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
         	give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
         	quotidian of love upon him.
         
         ORLANDO	I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
         	your remedy.
         
         ROSALIND	There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
         	taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
         	of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
         
         ORLANDO	What were his marks?
         
         ROSALIND	A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
         	sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
         	spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
         	which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
         	simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
         	revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
         	bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
         	untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
         	careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
         	are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
         	loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
         
         ORLANDO	Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
         
         ROSALIND	Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
         	love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
         	do than to confess she does: that is one of the
         	points in the which women still give the lie to
         	their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
         	that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
         	is so admired?
         
         ORLANDO	I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
         	Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
         
         ROSALIND	But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
         
         ORLANDO	Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
         
         ROSALIND	Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
         	as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
         	the reason why they are not so punished and cured
         	is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
         	are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
         
         ORLANDO	Did you ever cure any so?
         
         ROSALIND	Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
         	his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
         	woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
         	youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
         	and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
         	inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
         	passion something and for no passion truly any
         	thing, as boys and women are for the most part
         	cattle of this colour; would now  him, now loathe
         	him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
         	for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
         	from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
         	madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
         	the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
         	And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
         	me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
         	heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.
         
         ORLANDO	I would not be cured, youth.
         
         ROSALIND	I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
         	and come every day to my cote and woo me.
         
         ORLANDO	Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
         	where it is.
         
         ROSALIND	Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
         	you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
         	Will you go?
         
         ORLANDO	With all my heart, good youth.
         
         ROSALIND	Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         
         
         
         	AS YOU  IT
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	The forest.
         
         
         	[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind]
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
         	goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
         	doth my simple feature content you?
         
         AUDREY	Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!
         
         TOUCHSTONE	I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
         	capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
         
         JAQUES	[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
         	in a thatched house!
         
         TOUCHSTONE	When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
         	man's good wit seconded with the forward child
         	Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
         	great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
         	the gods had made thee poetical.
         
         AUDREY	I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
         	deed and word? is it a true thing?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
         	feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
         	they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
         
         AUDREY	Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
         	honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
         	hope thou didst feign.
         
         AUDREY	Would you not have me honest?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
         	honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
         
         JAQUES	[Aside]  A material fool!
         
         AUDREY	 Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
         	make me honest.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
         	were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
         
         AUDREY	I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
         	sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
         	be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
         	with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
         	village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
         	of the forest and to couple us.
         
         JAQUES	[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.
         
         AUDREY	Well, the gods give us joy!
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
         	stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
         	but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
         	though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are
         	necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
         	his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
         	knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
         	his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
         	Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
         	hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
         	therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
         	worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
         	married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
         	bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
         	skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
         	want. Here comes Sir Oliver.
         
         	[Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT]
         
         	Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you
         	dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
         	with you to your chapel?
         
         SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Is there none here to give the woman?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	I will not take her on gift of any man.
         
         SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
         
         JAQUES	[Advancing]
         
         	Proceed, proceed	I'll give her.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
         	sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
         	last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
         	toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.
         
         JAQUES	Will you be married, motley?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
         	the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
         	as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
         
         JAQUES	And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
         	married under a bush  a beggar? Get you to
         	church, and have a good priest that can tell you
         	what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
         	together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
         	prove a shrunk panel and,  green timber, warp, warp.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be
         	married of him than of another: for he is not 
         	to marry me well; and not being well married, it
         	will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
         
         JAQUES	Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	'Come, sweet Audrey:
         	We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
         	Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--
         	O sweet Oliver,
         	O brave Oliver,
         	Leave me not behind thee: but,--
         	Wind away,
         	Begone, I say,
         	I will not to wedding with thee.
         
         	[Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY]
         
         SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	'Tis no matter: never a fantastical knave of them
         	all shall flout me out of my calling.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         
         
         
         	AS YOU  IT
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The forest.
         
         
         	[Enter ROSALIND and CELIA]
         
         ROSALIND	Never talk to me; I will weep.
         
         CELIA	Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider
         	that tears do not become a man.
         
         ROSALIND	But have I not cause to weep?
         
         CELIA	As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
         
         ROSALIND	His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
         
         CELIA	Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
         	Judas's own children.
         
         ROSALIND	I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
         
         CELIA	An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
         
         ROSALIND	And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
         	of holy bread.
         
         CELIA	He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
         	of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
         	the very ice of chastity is in them.
         
         ROSALIND	But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
         	comes not?
         
         CELIA	Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
         
         ROSALIND	Do you think so?
         
         CELIA	Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
         	horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
         	think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
         	worm-eaten nut.
         
         ROSALIND	Not true in love?
         
         CELIA	Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
         
         ROSALIND	You have heard him swear downright he was.
         
         CELIA	'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
         	no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
         	both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
         	here in the forest on the duke your father.
         
         ROSALIND	I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
         	him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
         	him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
         	But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
         	man as Orlando?
         
         CELIA	O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
         	speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
         	them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
         	his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
         	but on one side, breaks his staff  a noble
         	goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
         	guides. Who comes here?
         
         	[Enter CORIN]
         
         CORIN	Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
         	After the shepherd that complained of love,
         	Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
         	Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
         	That was his mistress.
         
         CELIA	Well, and what of him?
         
         CORIN	If you will see a pageant truly played,
         	Between the pale complexion of true love
         	And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
         	Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
         	If you will mark it.
         
         ROSALIND	O, come, let us remove:
         	The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
         	Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
         	I'll prove a busy actor in their play.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         
         
         
         	AS YOU  IT
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE V	Another part of the forest.
         
         
         	[Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE]
         
         SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;
         	Say that you love me not, but say not so
         	In bitterness. The common executioner,
         	Whose heart the accustomed sight of death makes hard,
         	Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
         	But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
         	Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
         
         	[Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind]
         
         PHEBE	I would not be thy executioner:
         	I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
         	Thou tellest me there is murder in mine eye:
         	'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
         	That eyes, that are the frailest and softest things,
         	Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
         	Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers!
         	Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
         	And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
         	Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
         	Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
         	Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
         	Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
         	Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
         	Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
         	The cicatrice and capable impressure
         	Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
         	Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
         	Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
         	That can do hurt.
         
         SILVIUS	                  O dear Phebe,
         	If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
         	You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
         	Then shall you know the wounds invisible
         	That love's keen arrows make.
         
         PHEBE	But till that time
         	Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
         	Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
         	As till that time I shall not pity thee.
         
         ROSALIND	And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
         	That you insult, exult, and all at once,
         	Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
         	As, by my faith, I see no more in you
         	Than without candle may go dark to bed--
         	Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
         	Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
         	I see no more in you than in the ordinary
         	Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
         	I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
         	No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
         	'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
         	Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
         	That can entame my spirits to your worship.
         	You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
         	 foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
         	You are a thousand times a properer man
         	Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
         	That makes the world full of ill-favoured children:
         	'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
         	And out of you she sees herself more proper
         	Than any of her lineaments can show her.
         	But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
         	And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
         	For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
         	Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
         	Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
         	Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
         	So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.
         
         PHEBE	Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
         	I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
         
         ROSALIND	He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
         	fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
         	she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her
         	with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
         
         PHEBE	For no ill will I bear you.
         
         ROSALIND	I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
         	For I am falser than vows made in wine:
         	Besides, I  you not. If you will know my house,
         	'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
         	Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
         	Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
         	And be not proud: though all the world could see,
         	None could be so abused in sight as he.
         	Come, to our flock.
         
         	[Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN]
         
         PHEBE	Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
         	'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'
         
         SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe,--
         
         PHEBE	                  Ha, what sayest thou, Silvius?
         
         SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, pity me.
         
         PHEBE	Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
         
         SILVIUS	Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:
         	If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
         	By giving love your sorrow and my grief
         	Were both extermined.
         
         PHEBE	Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?
         
         SILVIUS	I would have you.
         
         PHEBE	                  Why, that were covetousness.
         	Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
         	And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
         	But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
         	Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
         	I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
         	But do not look for further recompense
         	Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.
         
         SILVIUS	So holy and so perfect is my love,
         	And I in such a poverty of grace,
         	That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
         	To glean the broken ears after the man
         	That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
         	A scattered smile, and that I'll live upon.
         
         PHEBE	Knowest now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
         
         SILVIUS	Not very well, but I have met him oft;
         	And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
         	That the old carlot once was master of.
         
         PHEBE	Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
         	'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
         	But what care I for words? yet words do well
         	When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
         	It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
         	But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
         	He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
         	Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
         	Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
         	He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
         	His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
         	There was a pretty redness in his lip,
         	A little riper and more lusty red
         	Than that mixed in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
         	Between the constant red and mingled damask.
         	There be some women, Silvius, had they marked him
         	In parcels as I did, would have gone near
         	To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
         	I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
         	I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
         	For what had he to do to chide at me?
         	He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
         	And, now I am remembered, scorned at me:
         	I marvel why I answered not again:
         	But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
         	I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
         	And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?
         
         SILVIUS	Phebe, with all my heart.
         
         PHEBE	I'll write it straight;
         	The matter's in my head and in my heart:
         	I will be bitter with him and passing short.
         	Go with me, Silvius.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         SCENE I	The forest.
         
         
         	[Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES]
         
         JAQUES	I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted
         	with thee.
         
         ROSALIND	They say you are a melancholy fellow.
         
         JAQUES	I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
         
         ROSALIND	Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
         	fellows and betray themselves to every modern
         	censure worse than drunkards.
         
         JAQUES	Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
         
         ROSALIND	Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
         
         JAQUES	I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
         	emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
         	nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
         	soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
         	which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
         	the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
         	melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
         	extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
         	contemplation of my travels, in which my often
         	rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.
         
         ROSALIND	A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
         	be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
         	other men's; then, to have seen much and to have
         	nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
         
         JAQUES	Yes, I have gained my experience.
         
         ROSALIND	And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
         	a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
         	sad; and to travel for it too!
         
         	[Enter ORLANDO]
         
         ORLANDO	Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!
         
         JAQUES	Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         ROSALIND	Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
         	wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
         	own country, be out of love with your nativity and
         	almost chide God for making you that countenance you
         	are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
         	gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
         	all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
         	another trick, never come in my sight more.
         
         ORLANDO	My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
         
         ROSALIND	Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
         	divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
         	a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
         	affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
         	hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
         	him heart-whole.
         
         ORLANDO	Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
         
         ROSALIND	Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
         	had as lief be wooed of a snail.
         
         ORLANDO	Of a snail?
         
         ROSALIND	Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
         	carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
         	I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
         	his destiny with him.
         
         ORLANDO	What's that?
         
         ROSALIND	Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
         	beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
         	his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
         
         ORLANDO	Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
         
         ROSALIND	And I am your Rosalind.
         
         CELIA	It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
         	Rosalind of a better leer than you.
         
         ROSALIND	Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
         	humour and  enough to consent. What would you
         	say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?
         
         ORLANDO	I would kiss before I spoke.
         
         ROSALIND	Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
         	gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
         	occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
         	out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God
         	warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
         
         ORLANDO	How if the kiss be denied?
         
         ROSALIND	Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
         
         ORLANDO	Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
         
         ROSALIND	Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
         	I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
         
         ORLANDO	What, of my suit?
         
         ROSALIND	Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
         	Am not I your Rosalind?
         
         ORLANDO	I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
         	talking of her.
         
         ROSALIND	Well in her person I say I will not have you.
         
         ORLANDO	Then in mine own person I die.
         
         ROSALIND	No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
         	almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
         	there was not any man died in his own person,
         	videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
         	dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
         	could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
         	of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
         	year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
         	for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
         	but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
         	taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
         	coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
         	But these are all lies: men have died from time to
         	time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
         
         ORLANDO	I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
         	for, I protest, her frown might kill me.
         
         ROSALIND	By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
         	I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
         	disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
         	it.
         
         ORLANDO	Then love me, Rosalind.
         
         ROSALIND	Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
         
         ORLANDO	And wilt thou have me?
         
         ROSALIND	Ay, and twenty such.
         
         ORLANDO	What sayest thou?
         
         ROSALIND	Are you not good?
         
         ORLANDO	I hope so.
         
         ROSALIND	Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
         	Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
         	Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?
         
         ORLANDO	Pray thee, marry us.
         
         CELIA	I cannot say the words.
         
         ROSALIND	You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'
         
         CELIA	Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
         
         ORLANDO	I will.
         
         ROSALIND	Ay, but when?
         
         ORLANDO	Why now; as fast as she can marry us.
         
         ROSALIND	Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
         
         ORLANDO	I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
         
         ROSALIND	I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
         	thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
         	before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
         	runs before her actions.
         
         ORLANDO	So do all thoughts; they are winged.
         
         ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her after you
         	have possessed her.
         
         ORLANDO	For ever and a day.
         
         ROSALIND	Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
         	men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
         	maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
         	changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
         	of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
         	more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
         	new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
         	than a monkey: I will weep for nothing,  Diana
         	in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
         	disposed to be merry; I will laugh  a hyen, and
         	that when thou art inclined to sleep.
         
         ORLANDO	But will my Rosalind do so?
         
         ROSALIND	By my life, she will do as I do.
         
         ORLANDO	O, but she is wise.
         
         ROSALIND	Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
         	wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
         	wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
         	'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
         	with the smoke out at the chimney.
         
         ORLANDO	A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
         	'Wit, whither wilt?'
         
         ROSALIND	Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
         	your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
         
         ORLANDO	And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
         
         ROSALIND	Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
         	never take her without her answer, unless you take
         	her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
         	make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
         	never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
         	it  a fool!
         
         ORLANDO	For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
         
         ROSALIND	Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
         
         ORLANDO	I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
         	will be with thee again.
         
         ROSALIND	Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you
         	would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
         	thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
         	won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
         	death! Two o'clock is your hour?
         
         ORLANDO	Ay, sweet Rosalind.
         
         ROSALIND	By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
         	me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
         	if you break one jot of your promise or come one
         	minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
         	pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
         	and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
         	may be chosen out of the gross band of the
         	unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
         	your promise.
         
         ORLANDO	With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
         	Rosalind: so adieu.
         
         ROSALIND	Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
         	offenders, and let Time try: adieu.
         
         	[Exit ORLANDO]
         
         CELIA	You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
         	we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
         	head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
         	her own nest.
         
         ROSALIND	O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
         	didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
         	it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
         	bottom,  the bay of Portugal.
         
         CELIA	Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
         	affection in, it runs out.
         
         ROSALIND	No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
         	of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
         	that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
         	because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
         	am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
         	of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
         	sigh till he come.
         
         CELIA	And I'll sleep.

         	[Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters]
         
         JAQUES	Which is he that killed the deer?
         
         A Lord	Sir, it was I.
         
         JAQUES	Let's present him to the duke,  a Roman
         	conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
         	horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
         	you no song, forester, for this purpose?
         
         Forester	Yes, sir.
         
         JAQUES	Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
         	make noise enough.
         	
         	SONG.
         Forester	What shall he have that killed the deer?
         	His leather skin and horns to wear.
         	Then sing him home;
         
         	[The rest shall bear this burden]
         
         	Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
         	It was a crest ere thou wast born:
         	Thy father's father wore it,
         	And thy father bore it:
         	The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
         	Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.

         ROSALIND	How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and
         	here much Orlando!
         
         CELIA	I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
         	hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
         	sleep. Look, who comes here.
         
         	[Enter SILVIUS]
         
         SILVIUS	My errand is to you, fair youth;
         	My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
         	I know not the contents; but, as I guess
         	By the stern brow and waspish action
         	Which she did use as she was writing of it,
         	It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
         	I am but as a guiltless messenger.
         
         ROSALIND	Patience herself would startle at this letter
         	And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
         	She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
         	She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
         	Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
         	Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
         	Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
         	This is a letter of your own device.
         
         SILVIUS	No, I protest, I know not the contents:
         	Phebe did write it.
         
         ROSALIND	Come, come, you are a fool
         	And turned into the extremity of love.
         	I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
         	A freestone-coloured hand; I verily did think
         	That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
         	She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
         	I say she never did invent this letter;
         	This is a man's invention and his hand.
         
         SILVIUS	Sure, it is hers.
         
         ROSALIND	Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
         	A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
         	 Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
         	Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
         	Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
         	Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
         
         SILVIUS	So please you, for I never heard it yet;
         	Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
         
         ROSALIND	She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	Art thou god to shepherd turned,
         	That a maiden's heart hath burned?
         	Can a woman rail thus?
         
         SILVIUS	Call you this railing?
         
         ROSALIND	[Reads]
         
         	Why, thy godhead laid apart,
         	Warrest thou with a woman's heart?
         	Did you ever hear such railing?
         	Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
         	That could do no vengeance to me.
         	Meaning me a beast.
         	If the scorn of your bright eyne
         	Have power to raise such love in mine,
         	Alack, in me what strange effect
         	Would they work in mild aspect!
         	Whiles you chid me, I did love;
         	How then might your prayers move!
         	He that brings this love to thee
         	Little knows this love in me:
         	And by him seal up thy mind;
         	Whether that thy youth and kind
         	Will the faithful offer take
         	Of me and all that I can make;
         	Or else by him my love deny,
         	And then I'll study how to die.
         
         SILVIUS	Call you this chiding?
         
         CELIA	Alas, poor shepherd!
         
         ROSALIND	Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt
         	thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
         	instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
         	be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
         	love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
         	her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
         	thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless
         	thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
         	hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

         OLIVER	Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,
         	Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
         	A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?
         
         CELIA	West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:
         	The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
         	Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
         	But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
         	There's none within.
         
         OLIVER	If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
         	Then should I know you by description;
         	Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,
         	Of female favour, and bestows himself
         	 a ripe sister: the woman low
         	And browner than her brother.' Are not you
         	The owner of the house I did inquire for?
         
         CELIA	It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
         
         OLIVER	Orlando doth commend him to you both,
         	And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
         	He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
         
         ROSALIND	I am: what must we understand by this?
         
         OLIVER	Some of my shame; if you will know of me
         	What man I am, and how, and why, and where
         	This handkercher was stained.
         
         CELIA	I pray you, tell it.
         
         OLIVER	When last the young Orlando parted from you
         	He left a promise to return again
         	Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
         	Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
         	Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
         	And mark what object did present itself:
         	Under an oak, whose boughs were mossed with age
         	And high top bald with dry antiquity,
         	A wretched ragged man, overgrown with hair,
         	Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
         	A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
         	Who with her head nimble in threats approached
         	The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
         	Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself,
         	And with indented glides did slip away
         	Into a bush: under which bush's shade
         	A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
         	Lay couching, head on ground, with cat watch,
         	When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
         	The royal disposition of that beast
         	To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
         	This seen, Orlando did approach the man
         	And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
         
         CELIA	O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
         	And he did render him the most unnatural
         	That lived amongst men.
         
         OLIVER	And well he might so do,
         	For well I know he was unnatural.
         
         ROSALIND	But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
         	Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?
         
         OLIVER	Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
         	But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
         	And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
         	Made him give battle to the lioness,
         	Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
         	From miserable slumber I awaked.
         
         CELIA	Are you his brother?
         
         ROSALIND	Wast you he rescued?
         
         CELIA	Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
         
         OLIVER	'Twas I; but 'tis not I	I do not shame
         	To tell you what I was, since my conversion
         	So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
         
         ROSALIND	But, for the bloody napkin?
         
         OLIVER	By and by.
         	When from the first to last betwixt us two
         	Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
         	As how I came into that desert place:--
         	In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
         	Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
         	Committing me unto my brother's love;
         	Who led me instantly unto his cave,
         	There stripped himself, and here upon his arm
         	The lioness had torn some flesh away,
         	Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
         	And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
         	Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound;
         	And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
         	He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
         	To tell this story, that you might excuse
         	His broken promise, and to give this napkin

         	knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen
         	philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,

         	and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and
         	overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner
         	met but they looked, no sooner looked but they
         	loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner
         	sighed but they asked one another the reason, no
         	sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;
         	and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
         	to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or
         	else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
         	the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs

         	the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
         	think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.

         	Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,

         	speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
         	of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;
         	neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
         	some little measure draw a belief from you, to do
         	yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if
         	you please, that I can do strange things: I have,
         	since I was three year old, conversed with a
         	magician, most profound in his art and yet not
         	damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
         	as your gesture cries it out, when your brother
         	marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into
         	what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is
         	not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient
         	to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
         	as she is and without any danger.

         	copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
         	marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
         	sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
         	humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
         	will: rich honesty dwells  a miser, sir, in a
         	poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.
         
         DUKE SENIOR	By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
         
         TOUCHSTONE	According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
         
         JAQUES	But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the
         	quarrel on the seventh cause?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
         	seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dis the
         	cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
         	if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
         	mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
         	If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
         	would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
         	this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
         	not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
         	called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
         	well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
         	is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
         	well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
         	Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
         	Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
         
         JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
         	nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
         	measured swords and parted.
         
         JAQUES	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
         
         TOUCHSTONE	O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have
         	books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
         	The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
         	Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
         	fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
         	Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
         	Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
         	these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
         	avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
         	justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
         	parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
         	of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and
         	they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
         	only peacemaker; much virtue in If.

         	That are so fortified against our story
         	What we have two nights seen.
         
         HORATIO	Well, sit we down,
         	And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
         
         BERNARDO	Last night of all,
         	When yond same star that's westward from the pole
         	Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
         	Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
         	The bell then beating one,--
         
         	[Enter Ghost]
         
         MARCELLUS	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
         
         BERNARDO	In the same figure,  the king that's dead.
         
         MARCELLUS	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
         
         BERNARDO	Looks it not  the king?  mark it, Horatio.
         
         HORATIO	Most : it harrows me with fear and wonder.
         
         BERNARDO	It would be spoke to.
         
         MARCELLUS	Question it, Horatio.
         
         HORATIO	What art thou that usurpest this time of night,
         	Together with that fair and war form
         	In which the majesty of buried Denmark
         	Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
         
         MARCELLUS	It is offended.
         
         BERNARDO	                  See, it stalks away!
         
         HORATIO	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
         
         	[Exit Ghost]
         
         MARCELLUS	'Tis gone, and will not answer.
         
         BERNARDO	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
         	Is not this something more than fantasy?
         	What think you on't?
         
         HORATIO	Before my God, I might not this believe
         	Without the sensible and true avouch
         	Of mine own eyes.
         
         MARCELLUS	                  Is it not  the king?
         
         HORATIO	As thou art to thyself:
         	Such was the very armour he had on
         	When he the ambitious Norway combated;
         	So frowned he once, when, in an angry parle,
         	He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
         	'Tis strange.
         
         MARCELLUS	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
         	With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
         
         HORATIO	In what particular thought to work I know not;
         	But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
         	This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
         
         MARCELLUS	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
         	Why this same strict and most observant watch
         	So nightly toils the subject of the land,
         	And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
         	And foreign mart for implements of war;
         	Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
         	Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
         	What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
         	Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
         	Who is't that can inform me?
         
         HORATIO	That can I;
         	At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
         	Whose image even but now appeared to us,
         	Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
         	Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,
         	Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
         	For so this side of our known world esteemed him--
         	Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a sealed compact,
         	Well ratified by law and heraldry,
         	Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
         	Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
         	Against the which, a moiety competent
         	Was gaged by our king; which had returned
         	To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
         	Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
         	And carriage of the article designed,
         	His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
         	Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
         	Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
         	Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes,
         	For food and diet, to some enterprise
         	That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
         	As it doth well appear unto our state--
         	But to recover of us, by strong hand
         	And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
         	So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
         	Is the main motive of our preparations,
         	The source of this our watch and the chief head
         	Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
         
         BERNARDO	I think it be no other but e'en so:
         	Well may it sort that this portentous figure
         	Comes armed through our watch; so  the king
         	That was and is the question of these wars.
         
         HORATIO	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
         	In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
         	A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
         	The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
         	Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
         	As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
         	Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
         	Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
         	Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
         	And even the  precurse of fierce events,
         	As harbingers preceding still the fates
         	And prologue to the omen coming on,
         	Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
         	Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
         	But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
         
         	[Re-enter Ghost]
         
         	I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
         	If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
         	Speak to me:
         	If there be any good thing to be done,
         	That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
         	Speak to me:
         
         	[Cock crows]
         
         	If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
         	Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
         	Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
         	Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
         	For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
         	Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
         
         MARCELLUS	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
         
         HORATIO	Do, if it will not stand.
         
         BERNARDO	'Tis here!
         
         HORATIO	'Tis here!
         
         MARCELLUS	'Tis gone!
         
         	[Exit Ghost]
         
         	We do it wrong, being so majestical,
         	To offer it the show of violence;
         	For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
         	And our vain blows malicious mockery.
         
         BERNARDO	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
         
         HORATIO	And then it started  a guilty thing
         	Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
         	The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
         	Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
         	Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
         	Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
         	The extravagant and erring spirit hies
         	To his confine: and of the truth herein
         	This present object made probation.
         
         MARCELLUS	It faded on the crowing of the cock.
         	Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
         	Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
         	The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
         	And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
         	The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
         	No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
         	So hallowed and so gracious is the time.
         
         HORATIO	So have I heard and do in part believe it.
         	But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
         	Walks over the dew of yon high eastward hill:
         	Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
         	Let us impart what we have seen to-night
         	Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
         	This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
         	Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
         	As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
         
         MARCELLUS	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
         	Where we shall find him most conveniently.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	A room of state in the castle.
         
         
         	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
         	POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
         	and Attendants]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
         	The memory be green, and that it us befitted
         	To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
         	To be contracted in one brow of woe,
         	Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
         	That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
         	Together with remembrance of ourselves.
         	Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
         	The imperial jointress to this war state,
         	Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
         	With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
         	With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
         	In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
         	Taken to wife: nor have we herein barred
         	Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
         	With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
         	Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
         	Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
         	Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
         	Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
         	Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
         	He hath not failed to pester us with message,
         	Importing the surrender of those lands
         	Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
         	To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
         	Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
         	Thus much the business is: we have here writ
         	To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
         	Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
         	Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
         	His further gait herein; in that the levies,
         	The lists and full proportions, are all made
         	Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
         	You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
         	For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
         	Giving to you no further personal power
         	To business with the king, more than the scope
         	Of these delated articles allow.
         	Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
         
         
         CORNELIUS	|
         	|  In that and all things will we show our duty.
         VOLTIMAND	|
         
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
         
         	[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
         
         	And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
         	You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
         	You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
         	And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
         	That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
         	The head is not more native to the heart,
         	The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
         	Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
         	What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
         
         LAERTES	My dread lord,
         	Your leave and favour to return to France;
         	From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
         	To show my duty in your coronation,
         	Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
         	My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
         	And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
         
         LORD POLONIUS	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
         	By laboursome petition, and at last
         	Upon his will I sealed my hard consent:
         	I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
         	And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
         	But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
         
         HAMLET	[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
         
         HAMLET	Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
         	And let thine eye look  a friend on Denmark.
         	Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
         	Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
         	Thou knowest 'tis common; all that lives must die,
         	Passing through nature to eternity.
         
         HAMLET	Ay, madam, it is common.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	If it be,
         	Why seems it so particular with thee?
         
         HAMLET	Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
         	'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
         	Nor customary suits of solemn black,
         	Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
         	No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
         	Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
         	Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
         	That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
         	For they are actions that a man might play:
         	But I have that within which passeth show;
         	These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
         	To give these mourning duties to your father:
         	But, you must know, your father lost a father;
         	That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
         	In filial obligation for some term
         	To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
         	In obstinate condolement is a course
         	Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
         	It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
         	A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
         	An understanding simple and unschooled:
         	For what we know must be and is as common
         	As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
         	Why should we in our peevish opposition
         	Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
         	A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
         	To reason most absurd: whose common theme
         	Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
         	From the first corse till he that died to-day,
         	'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
         	This unprevailing woe, and think of us
         	As of a father: for let the world take note,
         	You are the most immediate to our throne;
         	And with no less nobility of love
         	Than that which dearest father bears his son,
         	Do I impart toward you. For your intent
         	In going back to school in Wittenberg,
         	It is most retrograde to our desire:
         	And we beseech you, bend you to remain
         	Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
         	Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
         	I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
         
         HAMLET	I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
         	Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
         	This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
         	Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
         	No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
         	But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
         	And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
         	Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
         
         	[Exeunt all but HAMLET]
         
         HAMLET	O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
         	Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
         	Or that the Everlasting had not fixed
         	His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
         	How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
         	Seem to me all the uses of this world!
         	Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
         	That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
         	Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
         	But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
         	So excellent a king; that was, to this,
         	Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
         	That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
         	Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
         	Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
         	As if increase of appetite had grown
         	By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
         	Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
         	A little month, or ere those shoes were old
         	With which she followed my poor father's body,
         	 Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
         	O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
         	Would have mourned longer--married with my uncle,
         	My father's brother, but no more  my father
         	Than I to Hercules: within a month:
         	Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
         	Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
         	She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
         	With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
         	It is not nor it cannot come to good:
         	But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
         
         	[Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO]
         
         HORATIO	Hail to your lordship!
         
         HAMLET	I am glad to see you well:
         	Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
         
         HORATIO	The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
         
         HAMLET	Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
         	And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
         
         MARCELLUS	My good lord--
         
         HAMLET	I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
         	But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
         
         HORATIO	A truant disposition, good my lord.
         
         HAMLET	I would not hear your enemy say so,
         	Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
         	To make it truster of your own report
         	Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
         	But what is your affair in Elsinore?
         	We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
         
         HORATIO	My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
         
         HAMLET	I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
         	I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
         
         HORATIO	Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
         
         HAMLET	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
         	Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
         	Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
         	Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
         	My father!--methinks I see my father.
         
         HORATIO	Where, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	                  In my mind's eye, Horatio.
         
         HORATIO	I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
         
         HAMLET	He was a man, take him for all in all,
         	I shall not look upon his  again.
         
         HORATIO	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
         
         HAMLET	Saw? who?
         
         HORATIO	My lord, the king your father.
         
         HAMLET	The king my father!
         
         HORATIO	Season your admiration for awhile
         	With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
         	Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
         	This marvel to you.
         
         HAMLET	For God's love, let me hear.
         
         HORATIO	Two nights together had these gentlemen,
         	Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
         	In the dead vast and middle of the night,
         	Been thus encountered. A figure  your father,
         	Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
         	Appears before them, and with solemn march
         	Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walked
         	By their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes,
         	Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
         	Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
         	Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
         	In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
         	And I with them the third night kept the watch;
         	Where, as they had delivered, both in time,
         	Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
         	The apparition comes: I knew your father;
         	These hands are not more .
         
         HAMLET	But where was this?
         
         MARCELLUS	My lord, upon the platform where we watched.
         
         HAMLET	Did you not speak to it?
         
         HORATIO	My lord, I did;
         	But answer made it none: yet once methought
         	It lifted up its head and did address
         	Itself to motion,  as it would speak;
         	But even then the morning cock crew loud,
         	And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
         	And vanished from our sight.
         
         HAMLET	'Tis very strange.
         
         HORATIO	As I do live, my honoured lord, 'tis true;
         	And we did think it writ down in our duty
         	To let you know of it.
         
         HAMLET	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
         	Hold you the watch to-night?
         
         
         MARCELLUS	|
         	|	We do, my lord.
         BERNARDO	|
         
         
         HAMLET	Armed, say you?
         
         
         MARCELLUS	|
         	|  Armed, my lord.
         BERNARDO	|
         
         
         HAMLET	From top to toe?
         
         
         MARCELLUS	|
         	|             My lord, from head to foot.
         BERNARDO	|
         
         
         HAMLET	Then saw you not his face?
         
         HORATIO	O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
         
         HAMLET	What, looked he frowningly?
         
         HORATIO	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
         
         HAMLET	Pale or red?
         
         HORATIO	Nay, very pale.
         
         HAMLET	                  And fixed his eyes upon you?
         
         HORATIO	Most constantly.
         
         HAMLET	                  I would I had been there.
         
         HORATIO	It would have much amazed you.
         
         HAMLET	Very , very . Stayed it long?
         
         HORATIO	While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
         
         
         MARCELLUS	|
         	| Longer, longer.
         BERNARDO	|
         
         
         HORATIO	Not when I saw't.
         
         HAMLET	                  His beard was grizzled--no?
         
         HORATIO	It was, as I have seen it in his life,
         	A sable silvered.
         
         HAMLET	                  I will watch to-night;
         	Perchance 'twill walk again.
         
         HORATIO	I warrant it will.
         
         HAMLET	If it assume my noble father's person,
         	I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
         	And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
         	If you have hitherto concealed this sight,
         	Let it be tenable in your silence still;
         	And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
         	Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
         	I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
         	Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
         	I'll visit you.
         
         All	                  Our duty to your honour.
         
         HAMLET	Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
         
         	[Exeunt all but HAMLET]
         
         	My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
         	I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
         	Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
         	Though all the earth overwhelm them, to men's eyes.
         
         	[Exit]

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	A room in Polonius' house.
         
         
         	[Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA]
         
         LAERTES	My necessaries are embarked: farewell:
         	And, sister, as the winds give benefit
         	And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
         	But let me hear from you.
         
         OPHELIA	Do you doubt that?
         
         LAERTES	For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
         	Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
         	A violet in the youth of primy nature,
         	Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
         	The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
         
         OPHELIA	       No more but so?
         
         LAERTES	Think it no more;
         	For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
         	In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
         	The inward service of the mind and soul
         	Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
         	And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
         	The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
         	His greatness weighed, his will is not his own;
         	For he himself is subject to his birth:
         	He may not, as unvalued persons do,
         	Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
         	The safety and health of this whole state;
         	And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
         	Unto the voice and yielding of that body
         	Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
         	It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
         	As he in his particular act and place
         	May give his saying deed; which is no further
         	Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
         	Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
         	If with too credent ear you list his songs,
         	Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
         	To his unmastered importunity.
         	Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
         	And keep you in the rear of your affection,
         	Out of the shot and danger of desire.
         	The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
         	If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
         	Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
         	The canker galls the infants of the spring,
         	Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
         	And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
         	Contagious blastments are most imminent.
         	Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
         	Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
         
         OPHELIA	I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
         	As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
         	Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
         	Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
         	Whiles,  a puffed and reckless libertine,
         	Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
         	And recks not his own rede.
         
         LAERTES	O, fear me not.
         	I stay too long: but here my father comes.
         
         	[Enter POLONIUS]
         
         	A double blessing is a double grace,
         	Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
         	The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
         	And you are stayed for. There; my blessing with thee!
         	And these few precepts in thy memory
         	See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
         	Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
         	Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
         	Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
         	Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
         	But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
         	Of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade. Beware
         	Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
         	Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
         	Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
         	Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
         	Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
         	But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
         	For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
         	And they in France of the best rank and station
         	Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
         	Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
         	For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
         	And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
         	This above all: to thine ownself be true,
         	And it must follow, as the night the day,
         	Thou canst not then be false to any man.
         	Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
         
         LAERTES	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
         
         LAERTES	Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
         	What I have said to you.
         
         OPHELIA	'Tis in my memory locked,
         	And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
         
         LAERTES	Farewell.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         LORD POLONIUS	What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
         
         OPHELIA	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well bethought:
         	'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
         	Given private time to you; and you yourself
         	Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
         	If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
         	And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
         	You do not understand yourself so clearly
         	As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
         	What is between you? give me up the truth.
         
         OPHELIA	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
         	Of his affection to me.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Affection! pooh! you speak  a green girl,
         	Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
         	Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
         
         OPHELIA	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
         	That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
         	Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
         	Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
         	Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
         
         OPHELIA	My lord, he hath importuned me with love
         	In honourable fashion.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
         
         OPHELIA	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
         	With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
         	When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
         	Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
         	Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
         	Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
         	You must not take for fire. From this time
         	Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
         	Set your entreatments at a higher rate
         	Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
         	Believe so much in him, that he is young
         	And with a larger tether may he walk
         	Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
         	Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
         	Not of that dye which their investments show,
         	But mere implorators of unholy suits,
         	Breathing  sanctified and pious bawds,
         	The better to beguile. This is for all:
         	I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
         	Have you so slander any moment leisure,
         	As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
         	Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
         
         OPHELIA	I shall obey, my lord.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         
         
         
         	HAMLET
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	The platform.
         
         
         	[Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS]
         
         HAMLET	The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
         
         HORATIO	It is a nipping and an eager air.
         
         HAMLET	What hour now?
         
         HORATIO	                  I think it lacks of twelve.
         
         HAMLET	No, it is struck.
         
         HORATIO	Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
         	Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
         
         	[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within]
         
         	What does this mean, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
         	Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
         	And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
         	The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
         	The triumph of his pledge.
         
         HORATIO	Is it a custom?
         
         HAMLET	Ay, marry, is't:
         	But to my mind, though I am native here
         	And to the manner born, it is a custom
         	More honoured in the breach than the observance.
         	This heavy-headed revel east and west
         	Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations:
         	They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
         	Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
         	From our achievements, though performed at height,
         	The pith and marrow of our attribute.
         	So, oft it chances in particular men,
         	That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
         	As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
         	Since nature cannot choose his origin--
         	By the overgrowth of some complexion,
         	Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
         	Or by some habit that too much over-leavens
         	The form of plausive manners, that these men,
         	Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
         	Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
         	Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
         	As infinite as man may undergo--
         	Shall in the general censure take corruption
         	From that particular fault: the dram of eale
         	Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
         	To his own scandal.
         
         HORATIO	Look, my lord, it comes!
         
         	[Enter Ghost]
         
         HAMLET	Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
         	Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,
         	Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
         	Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
         	Thou comest in such a questionable shape
         	That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
         	King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
         	Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
         	Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
         	Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
         	Wherein we saw thee quietly inurned,
         	Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
         	To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
         	That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
         	Revisitest thus the glimpses of the moon,
         	Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
         	So horridly to shake our disposition
         	With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
         	Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
         
         	[Ghost beckons HAMLET]
         
         HORATIO	It beckons you to go away with it,
         	As if it some impartment did desire
         	To you alone.
         
         MARCELLUS	                  Look, with what courteous action
         	It waves you to a more removed ground:
         	But do not go with it.
         
         HORATIO	No, by no means.
         
         HAMLET	It will not speak; then I will follow it.
         
         HORATIO	Do not, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	                  Why, what should be the fear?
         	I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
         	And for my soul, what can it do to that,
         	Being a thing immortal as itself?
         	It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
         
         HORATIO	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
         	Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
         	That beetles over his base into the sea,
         	And there assume some other horrible form,
         	Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
         	And draw you into madness? think of it:
         	The very place puts toys of desperation,
         	Without more motive, into every brain
         	That looks so many fathoms to the sea
         	And hears it roar beneath.
         
         HAMLET	It waves me still.
         	Go on; I'll follow thee.
         
         MARCELLUS	You shall not go, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Hold off your hands.
         
         HORATIO	Be ruled; you shall not go.
         
         HAMLET	My fate cries out,
         	And makes each petty artery in this body
         	As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
         	Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.
         	By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
         	I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
         
         	[Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET]
         
         HORATIO	He waxes desperate with imagination.
         
         MARCELLUS	Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
         
         HORATIO	Have after. To what issue will this come?
         
         MARCELLUS	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
         
         HORATIO	Heaven will direct it.
         
         MARCELLUS	Nay, let's follow him.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE V	Another part of the platform.
         
         
         	[Enter GHOST and HAMLET]
         
         HAMLET	Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
         
         Ghost	Mark me.
         
         HAMLET	       I will.
         
         Ghost	                  My hour is almost come,
         	When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
         	Must render up myself.
         
         HAMLET	Alas, poor ghost!
         
         Ghost	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
         	To what I shall unfold.
         
         HAMLET	Speak; I am bound to hear.
         
         Ghost	 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
         
         HAMLET	What?
         
         Ghost	I am thy father's spirit,
         	Doomed for a certain term to walk the night,
         	And for the day confined to fast in fires,
         	Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
         	Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
         	To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
         	I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
         	Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
         	Make thy two eyes,  stars, start from their spheres,
         	Thy knotted and combined locks to part
         	And each particular hair to stand on end,
         	 quills upon the fretful porpentine:
         	But this eternal blazon must not be
         	To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
         	If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
         
         HAMLET	O God!
         
         Ghost	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
         
         HAMLET	Murder!
         
         Ghost	Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
         	But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
         
         HAMLET	Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
         	As meditation or the thoughts of love,
         	May sweep to my revenge.
         
         Ghost	I find thee apt;
         	And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
         	That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
         	Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
         	'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
         	A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
         	Is by a forged process of my death
         	Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
         	The serpent that did sting thy father's life
         	Now wears his crown.
         
         HAMLET	O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
         
         Ghost	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
         	With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
         	O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
         	So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
         	The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
         	O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
         	From me, whose love was of that dignity
         	That it went hand in hand even with the vow
         	I made to her in marriage, and to decline
         	Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
         	To those of mine!
         	But virtue, as it never will be moved,
         	Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
         	So lust, though to a radiant angel linked,
         	Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
         	And prey on garbage.
         	But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
         	Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
         	My custom always of the afternoon,
         	Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
         	With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
         	And in the porches of my ears did pour
         	The leperous distilment; whose effect
         	Holds such an enmity with blood of man
         	That swift as quicksilver it courses through
         	The natural gates and alleys of the body,
         	And with a sudden vigour doth posset
         	And curd,  eager droppings into milk,
         	The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
         	And a most instant tetter barked about,
         	Most lazar-, with vile and loathsome crust,
         	All my smooth body.
         	Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
         	Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatched:
         	Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
         	Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,
         	No reckoning made, but sent to my account
         	With all my imperfections on my head:
         	O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
         	If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
         	Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
         	A couch for luxury and damned incest.
         	But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
         	Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
         	Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
         	And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
         	To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
         	The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
         	And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
         	Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         HAMLET	O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
         	And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
         	And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
         	But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
         	Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
         	In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
         	Yea, from the table of my memory
         	I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
         	All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
         	That youth and observation copied there;
         	And thy commandment all alone shall live
         	Within the book and volume of my brain,
         	Unmixed with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
         	O most pernicious woman!
         	O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
         	My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
         	That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
         	At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
         
         	[Writing]
         
         	So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
         	It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
         	I have sworn 't.

         MARCELLUS	[Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
         
         HORATIO	[Within]	Heaven secure him!
         
         HAMLET	So be it!
         
         HORATIO	[Within]  Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
         
         HAMLET	Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
         
         	[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]
         
         MARCELLUS	How is't, my noble lord?
         
         HORATIO	What news, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	O, wonderful!
         
         HORATIO	                  Good my lord, tell it.
         
         HAMLET	No; you'll reveal it.
         
         HORATIO	Not I, my lord, by heaven.
         
         MARCELLUS	Nor I, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
         	But you'll be secret?
         
         
         HORATIO	|
         	|                   Ay, by heaven, my lord.
         MARCELLUS	|
         
         
         HAMLET	There's never a villain dwelling in all Denmark
         	But he's an arrant knave.
         
         HORATIO	There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
         	To tell us this.
         
         HAMLET	                  Why, right; you are i' the right;
         	And so, without more circumstance at all,
         	I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
         	You, as your business and desire shall point you;
         	For every man has business and desire,
         	Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
         	Look you, I'll go pray.
         
         HORATIO	These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
         	Yes, 'faith heartily.
         
         HORATIO	There's no offence, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
         	And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
         	It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
         	For your desire to know what is between us,
         	Overmaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
         	As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
         	Give me one poor request.
         
         HORATIO	What is't, my lord? we will.
         
         HAMLET	Never make known what you have seen to-night.
         
         
         HORATIO	|
         	| My lord, we will not.
         MARCELLUS	|
         
         
         HAMLET	Nay, but swear't.
         
         HORATIO	In faith,
         	My lord, not I.
         
         MARCELLUS	                  Nor I, my lord, in faith.
         
         HAMLET	Upon my sword.
         
         MARCELLUS	                  We have sworn, my lord, already.
         
         HAMLET	Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
         
         Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.
         
         HAMLET	Ah, ha, boy! sayest thou so? art thou there,
         	truepenny?
         	Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
         	Consent to swear.
         
         HORATIO	                  Propose the oath, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Never to speak of this that you have seen,
         	Swear by my sword.
         
         Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.
         
         HAMLET	Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
         	Come hither, gentlemen,
         	And lay your hands again upon my sword:
         	Never to speak of this that you have heard,
         	Swear by my sword.
         
         Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.
         
         HAMLET	Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
         	A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
         
         HORATIO	O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
         
         HAMLET	And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
         	There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
         	Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
         	Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
         	How strange or odd soever I bear myself,
         	As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
         	To put an antic disposition on,
         	That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
         	With arms encumbered thus, or this headshake,
         	Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
         	As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
         	Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
         	Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
         	That you know aught of me: this not to do,
         	So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
         
         Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.
         
         HAMLET	Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
         
         	[They swear]
         
         		        So, gentlemen,
         	With all my love I do commend me to you:
         	And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
         	May do, to express his love and friending to you,
         	God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
         	And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
         	The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
         	That ever I was born to set it right!
         	Nay, come, let's go together.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         SCENE I	A room in POLONIUS' house.
         
         
         	[Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO]
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
         
         REYNALDO	I will, my lord.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
         	Before you visit him, to make inquire
         	Of his behavior.
         
         REYNALDO	                  My lord, I did intend it.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
         	Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
         	And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
         	What company, at what expense; and finding
         	By this encompassment and drift of question
         	That they do know my son, come you more nearer
         	Than your particular demands will touch it:
         	Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
         	As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
         	And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
         
         REYNALDO	Ay, very well, my lord.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
         	But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
         	Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
         	What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
         	As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
         	But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
         	As are companions noted and most known
         	To youth and liberty.
         
         REYNALDO	As gaming, my lord.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
         	Drabbing: you may go so far.
         
         REYNALDO	My lord, that would dishonour him.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
         	You must not put another scandal on him,
         	That he is open to incontinency;
         	That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
         	That they may seem the taints of liberty,
         	The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
         	A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
         	Of general assault.
         
         REYNALDO	But, my good lord,--
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Wherefore should you do this?
         
         REYNALDO	Ay, my lord,
         	I would know that.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;
         	And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
         	You laying these slight sullies on my son,
         	As 'twere a thing a little soiled i' the working, Mark you,
         	Your party in converse, him you would sound,
         	Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
         	The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
         	He closes with you in this consequence;
         	'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
         	According to the phrase or the addition
         	Of man and country.
         
         REYNALDO	Very good, my lord.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
         	about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
         	something: where did I leave?
         
         REYNALDO	At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
         	and 'gentleman.'
         
         LORD POLONIUS	At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
         	He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
         	I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
         	Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
         	There was a' gaming; there overtook in's rouse;
         	There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
         	'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
         	Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
         	See you now;
         	Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
         	And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
         	With windlasses and with assays of bias,
         	By indirections find directions out:
         	So by my former lecture and advice,
         	Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
         
         REYNALDO	My lord, I have.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	                  God be wi' you; fare you well.
         
         REYNALDO	Good my lord!
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Observe his inclination in yourself.
         
         REYNALDO	I shall, my lord.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	And let him ply his music.
         
         REYNALDO	Well, my lord.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Farewell!
         
         	[Exit REYNALDO]
         
         	[Enter OPHELIA]
         
         	How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
         
         OPHELIA	O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
         
         LORD POLONIUS	With what, i' the name of God?
         
         OPHELIA	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
         	Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
         	No hat upon his head; his stockings fouled,
         	Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ancle;
         	Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
         	And with a look so piteous in purport
         	As if he had been loosed out of hell
         	To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Mad for thy love?
         
         OPHELIA	                  My lord, I do not know;
         	But truly, I do fear it.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	What said he?
         
         OPHELIA	He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
         	Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
         	And, with his other hand thus over his brow,
         	He falls to such perusal of my face
         	As he would draw it. Long stayed he so;
         	At last, a little shaking of mine arm
         	And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
         	He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
         	As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
         	And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
         	And, with his head over his shoulder turned,
         	He seemed to find his way without his eyes;
         	For out o' doors he went without their helps,
         	And, to the last, bended their light on me.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
         	This is the very ecstasy of love,
         	Whose violent property fordoes itself
         	And leads the will to desperate undertakings
         	As oft as any passion under heaven
         	That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
         	What, have you given him any hard words of late?
         
         OPHELIA	No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
         	I did repel his fetters and denied
         	His access to me.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	                  That hath made him mad.
         	I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
         	I had not quoted him: I feared he did but trifle,
         	And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
         	By heaven, it is as proper to our age
         	To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
         	As it is common for the younger sort
         	To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
         	This must be known; which, being kept close, might
         	move
         	More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	A room in the castle.
         
         
         	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,
         	GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
         	Moreover that we much did long to see you,
         	The need we have to use you did provoke
         	Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
         	Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
         	Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
         	Resembles that it was. What it should be,
         	More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
         	So much from the understanding of himself,
         	I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
         	That, being of so young days brought up with him,
         	And sith so neighboured to his youth and havior,
         	That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
         	Some little time: so by your companies
         	To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
         	So much as from occasion you may glean,
         	Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
         	That, opened, lies within our remedy.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you;
         	And sure I am two men there are not living
         	To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
         	To show us so much gentry and good will
         	As to expend your time with us awhile,
         	For the supply and profit of our hope,
         	Your visitation shall receive such thanks
         	As fits a king's remembrance.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Both your majesties
         	Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
         	Put your dread pleasures more into command
         	Than to entreaty.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	                  But we both obey,
         	And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
         	To lay our service freely at your feet,
         	To be commanded.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
         	And I beseech you instantly to visit
         	My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
         	And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	Heavens make our presence and our practises
         	Pleasant and helpful to him!
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Ay, amen!
         
         	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some
         	Attendants]
         
         	[Enter POLONIUS]
         
         LORD POLONIUS	The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
         	Are joyfully returned.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Thou still hast been the father of good news.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
         	I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
         	Both to my God and to my gracious king:
         	And I do think, or else this brain of mine
         	Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
         	As it hath used to do, that I have found
         	The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
         	My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
         
         	[Exit POLONIUS]
         
         	He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
         	The head and source of all your son's distemper.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	I doubt it is no other but the main;
         	His father's death, and our overhasty marriage.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Well, we shall sift him.
         
         	[Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
         
         		   Welcome, my good friends!
         	Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
         
         VOLTIMAND	Most fair return of greetings and desires.
         	Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
         	His nephew's levies; which to him appeared
         	To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
         	But, better looked into, he truly found
         	It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
         	That so his sickness, age and impotence
         	Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
         	On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
         	Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
         	Makes vow before his uncle never more
         	To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
         	Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
         	Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
         	And his commission to employ those soldiers,
         	So levied as before, against the Polack:
         	With an entreaty, herein further shown,
         
         	[Giving a paper]
         
         	That it might please you to give quiet pass
         	Through your dominions for this enterprise,
         	On such regards of safety and allowance
         	As therein are set down.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	It s us well;
         	And at our more considered time well read,
         	Answer, and think upon this business.
         	Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
         	Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
         	Most welcome home!
         
         	[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
         
         LORD POLONIUS	                  This business is well ended.
         	My liege, and madam, to expostulate
         	What majesty should be, what duty is,
         	Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
         	Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
         	Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
         	And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
         	I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
         	Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
         	What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
         	But let that go.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  More matter, with less art.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
         	That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
         	And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
         	But farewell it, for I will use no art.
         	Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
         	That we find out the cause of this effect,
         	Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
         	For this effect defective comes by cause:
         	Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
         	I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
         	Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
         	Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
         	beautified Ophelia,'--
         	That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
         	a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	'In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.'
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Came this from Hamlet to her?
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
         
         	[Reads]
         
         	edoubt thou the stars are fire;
         	Doubt that the sun doth move;
         	Doubt truth to be a liar;
         	But never doubt I love.
         	'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
         	I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
         	I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
         	'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
         	this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
         	This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
         	And more above, hath his solicitings,
         	As they fell out by time, by means and place,
         	All given to mine ear.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	But how hath she
         	Received his love?
         
         LORD POLONIUS	                  What do you think of me?
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	As of a man faithful and honourable.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
         	When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
         	As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
         	Before my daughter told me--what might you,
         	Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
         	If I had played the desk or table-book,
         	Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
         	Or looked upon this love with idle sight;
         	What might you think? No, I went round to work,
         	And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
         	'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
         	This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
         	That she should lock herself from his resort,
         	Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
         	Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
         	And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
         	Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
         	Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
         	Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
         	Into the madness wherein now he raves,
         	And all we mourn for.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Do you think 'tis this?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	It may be, very ly.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Hath there been such a time--Ied fain know that--
         	That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
         	When it proved otherwise?
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I know.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	[Pointing to his head and shoulder]
         
         	Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
         	If circumstances lead me, I will find
         	Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
         	Within the centre.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	                  How may we try it further?
         
         LORD POLONIUS	You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
         	Here in the lobby.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  So he does indeed.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
         	Be you and I behind an arras then;
         	Mark the encounter: if he love her not
         	And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
         	Let me be no assistant for a state,
         	But keep a farm and carters.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	We will try it.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Away, I do beseech you, both away:
         	I'll board him presently.
         
         	[Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and
         	Attendants]
         
         	[Enter HAMLET, reading]
         
         		    O, give me leave:
         	How does my good Lord Hamlet?
         
         HAMLET	Well, God-a-mercy.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Do you know me, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Not I, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Then I would you were so honest a man.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Honest, my lord!
         
         HAMLET	Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
         	one man picked out of ten thousand.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	That's very true, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
         	god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
         
         LORD POLONIUS	I have, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
         	blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
         	Friend, look to 't.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my
         	daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
         	was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
         	truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
         	love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
         	What do you read, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Words, words, words.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	What is the matter, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Between who?
         
         LORD POLONIUS	I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
         	that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
         	wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
         	plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
         	wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
         	though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
         	I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
         	yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if  a crab
         	you could go backward.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is method
         	in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Into my grave.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Indeed, that is out o' the air.
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
         	that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
         	could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
         	leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
         	meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
         	lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
         
         HAMLET	You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
         	more willingly part withal: except my life, except
         	my life, except my life.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Fare you well, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	These tedious old fools!
         
         	[Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         LORD POLONIUS	You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	[To POLONIUS]  God save you, sir!
         
         	[Exit POLONIUS]
         
         GUILDENSTERN	My honoured lord!
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	My most dear lord!
         
         HAMLET	My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
         	Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	As the indifferent children of the earth.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
         	On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
         
         HAMLET	Nor the soles of her shoe?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Neither, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
         	her favours?
         
         GUILDENSTERN	'Faith, her privates we.
         
         HAMLET	In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
         	is a strumpet. What's the news?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
         
         HAMLET	Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
         	Let me question more in particular: what have you,
         	my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
         	that she sends you to prison hither?
         
         GUILDENSTERN	Prison, my lord!
         
         HAMLET	Denmark's a prison.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Then is the world one.
         
         HAMLET	A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
         	wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	We think not so, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
         	either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
         	it is a prison.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
         	narrow for your mind.
         
         HAMLET	O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
         	myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
         	have bad dreams.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
         	substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
         
         HAMLET	A dream itself is but a shadow.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
         	quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
         
         HAMLET	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
         	outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
         	to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
         
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	|
         	| We'll wait upon you.
         GUILDENSTERN	|
         
         
         HAMLET	No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
         	of my servants, for, to speak to you  an honest
         	man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
         	beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
         
         HAMLET	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
         	thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
         	too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
         	your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
         	deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	What should we say, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
         	for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
         	which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
         	I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	To what end, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
         	the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
         	our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
         	love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
         	charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
         	whether you were sent for, or no?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?
         
         HAMLET	[Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
         	love me, hold not off.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	My lord, we were sent for.
         
         HAMLET	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
         	prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
         	and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
         	wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
         	custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
         	with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
         	earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
         	excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
         	overhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
         	with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
         	me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
         	What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
         	how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
         	express and admirable! in action how  an angel!
         	in apprehension how  a god! the beauty of the
         	world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
         	what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
         	me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
         	you seem to say so.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
         
         HAMLET	Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
         	lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
         	you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
         	coming, to offer you service.
         
         HAMLET	He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
         	shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
         	shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
         	sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
         	in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
         	lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
         	say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
         	for't. What players are they?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
         	tragedians of the city.
         
         HAMLET	How chances it they travel? their residence, both
         	in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
         	late innovation.
         
         HAMLET	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
         	in the city? are they so followed?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	No, indeed, are they not.
         
         HAMLET	How comes it? do they grow rusty?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
         	there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
         	that cry out on the top of question, and are most
         	tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
         	fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
         	call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
         	goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
         
         HAMLET	What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
         	they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
         	longer than they can sing? will they not say
         	afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
         	players--as it is most , if their means are no
         	better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
         	exclaim against their own succession?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
         	the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
         	controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
         	for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
         	cuffs in the question.
         
         HAMLET	Is't possible?
         
         GUILDENSTERN	O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
         
         HAMLET	Do the boys carry it away?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
         
         HAMLET	It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
         	Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
         	my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
         	hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
         	'Sblood, there is something in this more than
         	natural, if philosophy could find it out.
         
         	[Flourish of trumpets within]
         
         GUILDENSTERN	There are the players.
         
         HAMLET	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
         	come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
         	and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
         	lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
         	must show fairly outward, should more appear 
         	entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
         	uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	In what, my dear lord?
         
         HAMLET	I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
         	southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
         
         	[Enter POLONIUS]
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Well be with you, gentlemen!
         
         HAMLET	Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
         	hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
         	out of his swaddling-clouts.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
         	say an old man is twice a child.
         
         HAMLET	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
         	mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
         	'twas so indeed.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I have news to tell you.
         
         HAMLET	My lord, I have news to tell you.
         	When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
         
         LORD POLONIUS	The actors are come hither, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Buz, buz!
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Upon mine honour,--
         
         HAMLET	Then came each actor on his ass,--
         
         LORD POLONIUS	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
         	comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
         	historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
         	comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
         	poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
         	Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
         	liberty, these are the only men.
         
         HAMLET	O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
         
         LORD POLONIUS	What a treasure had he, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Why,
         	'One fair daughter and no more,
         	The which he loved passing well.'
         
         LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Still on my daughter.
         
         HAMLET	Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
         
         LORD POLONIUS	If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
         	that I love passing well.
         
         HAMLET	Nay, that follows not.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	What follows, then, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Why,
         	'As by lot, God wot,'
         	and then, you know,
         	'It came to pass, as most  it was,'--
         	the first row of the pious chanson will show you
         	more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
         
         	[Enter four or five Players]
         
         	You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
         	to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
         	friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
         	comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
         	lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
         	nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
         	altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, 
         	apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
         	ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
         	to't  French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
         	we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
         	of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
         
         First Player	What speech, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
         	never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
         	play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
         	caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
         	it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
         	cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
         	digested in the scenes, set down with as much
         	modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
         	were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
         	savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
         	indict the author of affectation; but called it an
         	honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
         	much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
         	chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
         	thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
         	Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
         	at this line: let me see, let me see--
         	'The rugged Pyrrhus,  the Hyrcanian beast,'--
         	it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
         	'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         	Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
         	When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         	Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared
         	With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
         	Now is he total gules; horridly tricked
         	With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         	Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
         	That lend a tyrannous and damned light
         	To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
         	And thus over-sized with coagulate gore,
         	With eyes  carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         	Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
         	So, proceed you.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
         	good discretion.
         
         First Player	'Anon he finds him
         	Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
         	Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
         	Repugnant to command: unequal matched,
         	Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
         	But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
         	The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
         	Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
         	Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
         	Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
         	Which was declining on the milky head
         	Of reverend Priam, seemed i' the air to stick:
         	So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
         	And  a neutral to his will and matter,
         	Did nothing.
         	But, as we often see, against some storm,
         	A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
         	The bold winds speechless and the orb below
         	As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
         	Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
         	Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
         	And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
         	On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
         	With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
         	Now falls on Priam.
         	Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
         	In general synod 'take away her power;
         	Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
         	And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
         	As low as to the fiends!'
         
         LORD POLONIUS	This is too long.
         
         HAMLET	It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
         	say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
         	sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
         
         First Player	'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
         
         HAMLET	'The mobled queen?'
         
         LORD POLONIUS	That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
         
         First Player	'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
         	With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
         	Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
         	About her lank and all over-teemed loins,
         	A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
         	Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steeped,
         	'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
         	pronounced:
         	But if the gods themselves did see her then
         	When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
         	In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
         	The instant burst of clamour that she made,
         	Unless things mortal move them not at all,
         	Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
         	And passion in the gods.'
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
         	tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
         
         HAMLET	'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
         	Good my lord, will you see the players well
         	bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
         	they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
         	time: after your death you were better have a bad
         	epitaph than their ill report while you live.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
         
         HAMLET	God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
         	after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
         	Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
         	they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
         	Take them in.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Come, sirs.
         
         HAMLET	Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
         
         	[Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First]
         
         	Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
         	Murder of Gonzago?
         
         First Player	Ay, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
         	study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
         	I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
         
         First Player	Ay, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
         	not.
         
         	[Exit First Player]
         
         	My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
         	welcome to Elsinore.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Good my lord!
         
         HAMLET	Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
         
         	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         		  Now I am alone.
         	O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
         	Is it not monstrous that this player here,
         	But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
         	Could force his soul so to his own conceit
         	That from her working all his visage wanned,
         	Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
         	A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
         	With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
         	For Hecuba!
         	What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
         	That he should weep for her? What would he do,
         	Had he the motive and the cue for passion
         	That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
         	And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
         	Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
         	Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
         	The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
         	A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
         	 John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
         	And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
         	Upon whose property and most dear life
         	A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?
         	Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
         	Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
         	Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
         	As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
         	Ha!
         	'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
         	But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall
         	To make oppression bitter, or ere this
         	I should have fatted all the region kites
         	With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
         	Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
         	O, vengeance!
         	Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
         	That I, the son of a dear father murdered,
         	Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
         	Must,  a whore, unpack my heart with words,
         	And fall a-cursing,  a very drab,
         	A scullion!
         	Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
         	That guilty creatures sitting at a play
         	Have by the very cunning of the scene
         	Been struck so to the soul that presently
         	They have proclaimed their malefactions;
         	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
         	With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
         	Play something  the murder of my father
         	Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
         	I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
         	I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
         	May be the devil: and the devil hath power
         	To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
         	Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
         	As he is very potent with such spirits,
         	Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
         	More relative than this: the play 's the thing
         	Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

         SCENE I	A room in the castle.
         
         
         	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS,
         	OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
         	Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
         	Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
         	With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	He does confess he feels himself distracted;
         	But from what cause he will by no means speak.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
         	But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
         	When we would bring him on to some confession
         	Of his true state.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  Did he receive you well?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Most  a gentleman.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	But with much forcing of his disposition.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
         	Most free in his reply.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Did you assay him?
         	To any pastime?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
         	We over-raught on the way: of these we told him;
         	And there did seem in him a kind of joy
         	To hear of it: they are about the court,
         	And, as I think, they have already order
         	This night to play before him.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	'Tis most true:
         	And he beseeched me to entreat your majesties
         	To hear and see the matter.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	With all my heart; and it doth much content me
         	To hear him so inclined.
         	Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
         	And drive his purpose on to these delights.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	We shall, my lord.
         
         	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	                  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
         	For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
         	That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
         	Affront Ophelia:
         	Her father and myself, lawful espials,
         	Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
         	We may of their encounter frankly judge,
         	And gather by him, as he is behaved,
         	If 't be the affliction of his love or no
         	That thus he suffers for.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	I shall obey you.
         	And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
         	That your good beauties be the happy cause
         	Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
         	Will bring him to his wonted way again,
         	To both your honours.
         
         OPHELIA	Madam, I wish it may.
         
         	[Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE]
         
         LORD POLONIUS	Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
         	We will bestow ourselves.
         
         	[To OPHELIA]
         
         		    Read on this book;
         	That show of such an exercise may colour
         	Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
         	'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
         	And pious action we do sugar over
         	The devil himself.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]          O, 'tis too true!
         	How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
         	The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
         	Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
         	Than is my deed to my most painted word:
         	O heavy burthen!
         
         LORD POLONIUS	I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
         
         	[Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS]
         
         	[Enter HAMLET]
         
         HAMLET	To be, or not to be: that is the question:
         	Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
         	The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
         	Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
         	And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
         	No more; and by a sleep to say we end
         	The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
         	That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
         	Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep;
         	To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
         	For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
         	When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
         	Must give us pause: there's the respect
         	That makes calamity of so long life;
         	For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
         	The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
         	The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
         	The insolence of office and the spurns
         	That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
         	When he himself might his quietus make
         	With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
         	To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
         	But that the dread of something after death,
         	The undiscovered country from whose bourn
         	No traveller returns, puzzles the will
         	And makes us rather bear those ills we have
         	Than fly to others that we know not of?
         	Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
         	And thus the native hue of resolution
         	Is sicklied over with the pale cast of thought,
         	And enterprises of great pith and moment
         	With this regard their currents turn awry,
         	And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
         	The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
         	Be all my sins remembered.
         
         OPHELIA	Good my lord,
         	How does your honour for this many a day?
         
         HAMLET	I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
         
         OPHELIA	My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
         	That I have longed long to re-deliver;
         	I pray you, now receive them.
         
         HAMLET	No, not I;
         	I never gave you aught.
         
         OPHELIA	My honoured lord, you know right well you did;
         	And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
         	As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
         	Take these again; for to the noble mind
         	Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
         	There, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Ha, ha! are you honest?
         
         OPHELIA	My lord?
         
         HAMLET	Are you fair?
         
         OPHELIA	What means your lordship?
         
         HAMLET	That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
         	admit no discourse to your beauty.
         
         OPHELIA	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
         	with honesty?
         
         HAMLET	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
         	transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
         	force of honesty can translate beauty into his
         	ness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
         	time gives it proof. I did love you once.
         
         OPHELIA	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
         
         HAMLET	You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
         	so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
         	it: I loved you not.
         
         OPHELIA	I was the more deceived.
         
         HAMLET	Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
         	breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
         	but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
         	were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
         	proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
         	my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
         	imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
         	in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
         	between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
         	all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
         	Where's your father?
         
         OPHELIA	At home, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
         	fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
         
         OPHELIA	O, help him, you sweet heavens!
         
         HAMLET	If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
         	thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
         	snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
         	nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
         	marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
         	what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
         	and quickly too. Farewell.
         
         OPHELIA	O heavenly powers, restore him!
         
         HAMLET	I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
         	has given you one face, and you make yourselves
         	another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
         	nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
         	your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
         	made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
         	those that are married already, all but one, shall
         	live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
         	nunnery, go.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         OPHELIA	O, what a noble mind is here overthrown!
         	The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
         	The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
         	The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
         	The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
         	And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
         	That sucked the honey of his music vows,
         	Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
         	 sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
         	That unmatched form and feature of blown youth
         	Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
         	To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
         
         	[Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Love! his affections do not that way tend;
         	Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,
         	Was not  madness. There's something in his soul,
         	Over which his melancholy sits on brood;
         	And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
         	Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
         	I have in quick determination
         	Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
         	For the demand of our neglected tribute
         	Haply the seas and countries different
         	With variable objects shall expel
         	This something-settled matter in his heart,
         	Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
         	From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
         
         LORD POLONIUS	It shall do well: but yet do I believe
         	The origin and commencement of his grief
         	Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
         	You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
         	We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
         	But, if you hold it fit, after the play
         	Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
         	To show his grief: let her be round with him;
         	And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
         	Of all their conference. If she find him not,
         	To England send him, or confine him where
         	Your wisdom best shall think.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	It shall be so:
         	Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	A hall in the castle.
         
         
         	[Enter HAMLET and Players]
         
         HAMLET	Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
         	you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
         	as many of your players do, I had as lief the
         	town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
         	too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
         	for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
         	the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
         	a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
         	offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
         	periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
         	very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
         	for the most part are capable of nothing but
         	inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
         	a fellow whipped for overdoing Termagant; it
         	out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
         
         First Player	I warrant your honour.
         
         HAMLET	Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
         	be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
         	word to the action; with this special overstep not
         	the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
         	from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
         	first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
         	mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
         	scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
         	the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
         	or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
         	laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
         	censure of the which one must in your allowance
         	overweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
         	players that I have seen play, and heard others
         	praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
         	that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
         	the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
         	strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
         	nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
         	well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
         
         First Player	I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
         	sir.
         
         HAMLET	O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
         	your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
         	for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
         	set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
         	too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
         	question of the play be then to be considered:
         	that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
         	in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

         LORD POLONIUS	And the queen too, and that presently.

         	[Enter HORATIO]
         
         HORATIO	Here, sweet lord, at your service.
         
         HAMLET	Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
         	As ever my conversation coped withal.
         
         HORATIO	O, my dear lord,--
         
         HAMLET	                  Nay, do not think I flatter;
         	For what advancement may I hope from thee
         	That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
         	To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flattered?
         	No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
         	And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
         	Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
         	Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
         	And could of men distinguish, her election
         	Hath sealed thee for herself; for thou hast been
         	As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
         	A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
         	Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
         	Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
         	That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
         	To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
         	That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
         	In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
         	As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
         	There is a play to-night before the king;
         	One scene of it comes near the circumstance
         	Which I have told thee of my father's death:
         	I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
         	Even with the very comment of thy soul
         	Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
         	Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
         	It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
         	And my imaginations are as foul
         	As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
         	For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
         	And after we will both our judgments join
         	In censure of his seeming.
         
         HORATIO	Well, my lord:
         	If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
         	And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
         
         HAMLET	They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
         	Get you a place.
         
         	[Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS,

         KING CLAUDIUS	How fares our cousin Hamlet?
         
         HAMLET	Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
         	the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
         	are not mine.
         
         HAMLET	No, nor mine now.
         
         	[To POLONIUS]
         
         	My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
         
         LORD POLONIUS	That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
         
         HAMLET	What did you enact?
         
         LORD POLONIUS	I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
         	Capitol; Brutus killed me.
         
         HAMLET	It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
         	there. Be the players ready?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
         
         HAMLET	No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
         
         LORD POLONIUS	[To KING CLAUDIUS]  O, ho! do you mark that?
         
         HAMLET	Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
         
         	[Lying down at OPHELIA's feet]
         
         OPHELIA	No, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	I mean, my head upon your lap?
         
         OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Do you think I meant country matters?
         
         OPHELIA	I think nothing, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
         
         OPHELIA	What is, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Nothing.

         HAMLET	Who, I?
         
         OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
         	but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
         	mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
         
         OPHELIA	Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
         	I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
         	months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
         	hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
         	a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
         	then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
         	the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,

         	upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,
         	leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
         	crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's

         HAMLET	As woman's love.
         
         	[Enter two Players, King and Queen]
         
         Player King	   Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
         	Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
         	And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
         	About the world have times twelve thirties been,
         	Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
         	Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
         
         Player Queen	   So many journeys may the sun and moon
         	Make us again count over ere love be done!
         	But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
         	So far from cheer and from your former state,
         	That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
         	Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
         	For women's fear and love holds quantity;
         	In neither aught, or in extremity.
         	Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
         	And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
         	Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
         	Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
         
         Player King	'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
         	My operant powers their functions leave to do:
         	And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,

         	For husband shalt thou--
         
         Player Queen	O, confound the rest!
         	Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
         	In second husband let me be accurst!
         	None wed the second but who killed the first.
         
         HAMLET	[Aside]  Wormwood, wormwood.
         
         Player Queen	   The instances that second marriage move
         	Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
         	A second time I kill my husband dead,
         	When second husband kisses me in bed.
         
         Player King	   I do believe you think what now you speak;
         	But what we do determine oft we break.
         	Purpose is but the slave to memory,
         	Of violent birth, but poor validity;
         	Which now,  fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
         	But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
         	Most necessary 'tis that we forget
         	To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
         	What to ourselves in passion we propose,
         	The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
         	The violence of either grief or joy
         	Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
         	Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
         	Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
         	This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
         	That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
         	For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
         	Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
         	The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
         	The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
         	And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
         	For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
         	And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
         	Directly seasons him his enemy.
         	But, orderly to end where I begun,
         	Our wills and fates do so contrary run
         	That our devices still are overthrown;
         	Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
         	So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
         	But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
         
         Player Queen	   Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
         	Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
         	To desperation turn my trust and hope!
         	An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
         	Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
         	Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
         	Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
         	If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
         
         HAMLET	If she should break it now!
         
         Player King	'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
         	My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
         	The tedious day with sleep.
         
         	[Sleeps]
         
         Player Queen	Sleep rock thy brain,
         	And never come mischance between us twain!

         QUEEN GERTRUDE	The lady protests too much, methinks.
         
         HAMLET	O, but she'll keep her word.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
         
         HAMLET	No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
         	i' the world.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	What do you call the play?
         
         HAMLET	The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
         	is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
         	the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
         	anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
         	that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
         	touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
         	withers are unwrung.
         
         	[Enter LUCIANUS]
         
         	This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
         
         OPHELIA	You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	I could interpret between you and your love, if I

         GUILDENSTERN	Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
         
         HAMLET	With drink, sir?
         
         GUILDENSTERN	No, my lord, rather with choler.
         
         HAMLET	Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
         	signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
         	to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
         	more choler.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
         	start not so wildly from my affair.

         GUILDENSTERN	The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of

         HAMLET	You are welcome.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
         	breed. If it shall please you to make me a
         	wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
         	commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
         	shall be the end of my business.
         
         HAMLET	Sir, I cannot.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	What, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
         	sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
         	or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
         	more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
         	into amazement and admiration.
         
         HAMLET	O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
         	is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
         	admiration? Impart.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
         	go to bed.

         	you any further trade with us?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, you once did love me.
         
         HAMLET	So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
         	do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
         	you deny your griefs to your friend.
         
         HAMLET	Sir, I lack advancement.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
         	himself for your succession in Denmark?
         
         HAMLET	Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
         	is something musty.

         	unmannerly.
         
         HAMLET	I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
         	this pipe?

         HAMLET	I do beseech you.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	I know no touch of it, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
         	your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
         	mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
         	Look you, these are the stops.
         
         GUILDENSTERN	But these cannot I command to any utterance of
         	harmony; I have not the skill.
         
         HAMLET	Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
         	me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
         	my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
         	mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
         	the top of my compass: and there is much music,
         	excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
         	you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
         	easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what

         LORD POLONIUS	It is backed  a weasel.

         	O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
         	It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,

         	Though inclination be as sharp as will:
         	My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
         	And,  a man to double business bound,

         	And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
         	Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
         	Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
         	To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy

         	And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
         	To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
         	Or pardoned being down? Then I'll look up;
         	My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
         	Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
         	That cannot be; since I am still possessed
         	Of those effects for which I did the murder,
         	My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
         	May one be pardoned and retain the offence?
         	In the corrupted currents of this world
         	Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
         	And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
         	Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
         	There is no shuffling, there the action lies
         	In his true nature; and we ourselves compelled,
         	Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
         	To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
         	Try what repentance can: what can it not?

         	O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
         	O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
         	Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
         	Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
         	Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!

         HAMLET	Nay, I know not:
         	Is it the king?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
         
         HAMLET	A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
         	As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	As kill a king!
         
         HAMLET	                  Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
         
         	[Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS]
         
         	Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
         	I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
         	Thou findest to be too busy is some danger.
         	Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
         	And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
         	If it be made of penetrable stuff,
         	If damned custom have not brassed it so
         	That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
         	In noise so rude against me?
         
         HAMLET	Such an act
         	That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
         	Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
         	From the fair forehead of an innocent love
         	And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
         	As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
         	As from the body of contraction plucks
         	The very soul, and sweet religion makes
         	A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
         	Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
         	With tristful visage, as against the doom,
         	Is thought-sick at the act.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Ay me, what act,
         	That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
         
         HAMLET	Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
         	The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
         	See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
         	Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
         	An eye  Mars, to threaten and command;
         	A station  the herald Mercury
         	New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
         	A combination and a form indeed,
         	Where every god did seem to set his seal,
         	To give the world assurance of a man:
         	This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
         	Here is your husband;  a mildewed ear,
         	Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
         	Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
         	And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
         	You cannot call it love; for at your age
         	The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
         	And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
         	Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
         	Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
         	Is apoplexed; for madness would not err,
         	Nor sense to ecstasy was never so thralled
         	But it reserved some quantity of choice,
         	To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
         	That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?
         	Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
         	Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
         	Or but a sickly part of one true sense
         	Could not so mope.
         	O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
         	If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
         	To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
         	And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
         	When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
         	Since frost itself as actively doth burn
         	And reason panders will.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	O Hamlet, speak no more:
         	Thou turnest mine eyes into my very soul;
         	And there I see such black and grained spots
         	As will not leave their tinct.
         
         HAMLET	Nay, but to live
         	In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
         	Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love
         	Over the nasty sty,--
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	O, speak to me no more;
         	These words,  daggers, enter in mine ears;
         	No more, sweet Hamlet!
         
         HAMLET	A murderer and a villain;
         	A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
         	Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
         	A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
         	That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
         	And put it in his pocket!
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	No more!
         
         HAMLET	A king of shreds and patches,--
         
         	[Enter Ghost]
         
         	Save me, and hover over me with your wings,
         	You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, he's mad!
         
         HAMLET	Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
         	That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
         	The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
         
         Ghost	Do not forget: this visitation
         	Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
         	But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
         	O, step between her and her fighting soul:
         	Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
         	Speak to her, Hamlet.
         
         HAMLET	How is it with you, lady?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, how is't with you,
         	That you do bend your eye on vacancy
         	And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
         	Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
         	And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
         	Your bedded hair,  life in excrements,
         	Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
         	Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
         	Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
         
         HAMLET	On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
         	His form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,
         	Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
         	Lest with this piteous action you convert
         	My stern effects: then what I have to do
         	Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	To whom do you speak this?
         
         HAMLET	Do you see nothing there?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
         
         HAMLET	Nor did you nothing hear?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	No, nothing but ourselves.
         
         HAMLET	Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
         	My father, in his habit as he lived!
         	Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
         
         	[Exit Ghost]
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	This the very coinage of your brain:
         	This bodiless creation ecstasy
         	Is very cunning in.
         
         HAMLET	Ecstasy!
         	My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
         	And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
         	That I have uttered: bring me to the test,
         	And I the matter will re-word; which madness
         	Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
         	Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
         	That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
         	It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
         	Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
         	Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
         	Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
         	And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
         	To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
         	For in the fatness of these pursy times
         	Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
         	Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
         
         HAMLET	O, throw away the worser part of it,
         	And live the purer with the other half.
         	Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
         	Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
         	That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
         	Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
         	That to the use of actions fair and good
         	He wise gives a frock or livery,
         	That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
         	And that shall lend a kind of easiness
         	To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
         	For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
         	And either [         ] the devil, or throw him out
         	With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
         	And when you are desirous to be blessed,
         	I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
         
         	[Pointing to POLONIUS]
         
         	I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
         	To punish me with this and this with me,
         	That I must be their scourge and minister.
         	I will bestow him, and will answer well
         	The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
         	I must be cruel, only to be kind:
         	Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
         	One word more, good lady.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	What shall I do?
         
         HAMLET	Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
         	Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
         	Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
         	And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
         	Or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers,
         	Make you to ravel all this matter out,
         	That I essentially am not in madness,
         	But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
         	For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
         	Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
         	Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
         	No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
         	Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
         	Let the birds fly, and,  the famous ape,
         	To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
         	And break your own neck down.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
         	And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
         	What thou hast said to me.
         
         HAMLET	I must to England; you know that?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alack,
         	I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
         
         HAMLET	There's letters sealed: and my two schoolfellows,
         	Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged,
         	They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
         	And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
         	For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
         	Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
         	But I will delve one yard below their mines,
         	And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
         	When in one line two crafts directly meet.
         	This man shall set me packing:
         	I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
         	Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
         	Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
         	Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
         	Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
         	Good night, mother.

         	and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
         	You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
         	Where is your son?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Bestow this place on us a little while.
         
         	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         	Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
         	Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
         	Behind the arras hearing something stir,
         	Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
         	And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
         	The unseen good old man.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	O heavy deed!
         	It had been so with us, had we been there:
         	His liberty is full of threats to all;
         	To you yourself, to us, to every one.
         	Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?
         	It will be laid to us, whose providence
         	Should have kept short, restrained and out of haunt,
         	This mad young man: but so much was our love,
         	We would not understand what was most fit;
         	But,  the owner of a foul disease,
         	To keep it from divulging, let it feed
         	Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	To draw apart the body he hath killed:
         	Over whom his very madness,  some ore
         	Among a mineral of metals base,
         	Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	O Gertrude, come away!
         	The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
         	But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
         	We must, with all our majesty and skill,
         	Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
         
         	[Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         	Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
         	Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
         	And from his mother's closet hath he dragged him:
         	Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
         	Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
         
         	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         	Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
         	And let them know, both what we mean to do,
         	And what's untimely done [                ]
         	Whose whisper over the world's diameter,
         	As level as the cannon to his blank,
         	Transports his poisoned shot, may miss our name,
         	And hit the woundless air. O, come away!

         	O, here they come.
         
         	[Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
         
         HAMLET	Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
         	And bear it to the chapel.
         
         HAMLET	Do not believe it.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Believe what?
         
         HAMLET	That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
         	Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
         	replication should be made by the son of a king?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
         	rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
         	king best service in the end: he keeps them, 
         	an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
         	be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
         	gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
         	shall be dry again.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	I understand you not, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
         	foolish ear.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
         	with us to the king.
         
         HAMLET	The body is with the king, but the king is not with
         	the body. The king is a thing--
         
         GUILDENSTERN	A thing, my lord!

         	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
         	How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
         	Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
         	He's loved of the distracted multitude,
         	Who  not in their judgment, but their eyes;
         	And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weighed,
         	But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
         	This sudden sending him away must seem
         	Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
         	By desperate appliance are relieved,
         	Or not at all.
         
         	[Enter ROSENCRANTZ]
         
         	How now! what hath befall'n?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord,
         	We cannot get from him.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	But where is he?
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Bring him before us.
         
         ROSENCRANTZ	Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
         
         	[Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
         
         HAMLET	At supper.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	At supper! where?
         
         HAMLET	Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
         	convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
         	worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
         	creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
         	maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
         	variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
         	that's the end.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Alas, alas!
         
         HAMLET	A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
         	king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	What dost you mean by this?
         
         HAMLET	Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
         	progress through the guts of a beggar.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Where is Polonius?
         
         HAMLET	In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
         	find him not there, seek him i' the other place
         	yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
         	this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
         	stairs into the lobby.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Go seek him there.
         
         	[To some Attendants]

         KING CLAUDIUS	Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
         	Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
         	For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
         	With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
         	The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
         	The associates tend, and every thing is bent
         	For England.
         
         HAMLET	                  For England!
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Ay, Hamlet.
         
         HAMLET	Good.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	So is it, if thou knewest our purposes.
         
         HAMLET	I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
         	England! Farewell, dear mother.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Thy loving father, Hamlet.
         
         HAMLET	My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
         	and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
         
         	[Exit]

         	Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
         	Away! for every thing is sealed and done
         	That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
         
         	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
         
         	And, England, if my love thou holdest at aught--
         	As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
         	Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
         	After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
         	Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
         	Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
         	By letters congruing to that effect,
         	The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
         	For  the hectic in my blood he rages,
         	And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,

         	Craves the conveyance of a promised march
         	Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
         	If that his majesty would aught with us,

         Captain	They are of Norway, sir.
         
         HAMLET	How purposed, sir, I pray you?
         
         Captain	Against some part of Poland.
         
         HAMLET	Who commands them, sir?
         
         Captain	The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
         
         HAMLET	Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
         	Or for some frontier?
         
         Captain	Truly to speak, and with no addition,
         	We go to gain a little patch of ground
         	That hath in it no profit but the name.
         	To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
         	Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
         	A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
         
         HAMLET	Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
         
         Captain	Yes, it is already garrisoned.
         
         HAMLET	Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
         	Will not debate the question of this straw:
         	This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
         	That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
         	Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.

         	[Exeunt all except HAMLET]
         
         	How all occasions do inform against me,
         	And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
         	If his chief good and market of his time
         	Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
         	Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
         	Looking before and after, gave us not
         	That capability and god- reason
         	To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
         	Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
         	Of thinking too precisely on the event,
         	A thought which, quartered, hath but one part wisdom
         	And ever three parts coward, I do not know
         	Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
         	Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
         	To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
         	Witness this army of such mass and charge
         	Led by a delicate and tender prince,
         	Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed
         	Makes mouths at the invisible event,
         	Exposing what is mortal and unsure
         	To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
         	Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
         	Is not to stir without great argument,
         	But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
         	When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
         	That have a father killed, a mother stained,
         	Excitements of my reason and my blood,
         	And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
         	The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
         	That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
         	Go to their graves  beds, fight for a plot
         	Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
         	Which is not tomb enough and continent
         	To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
         	My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

         Gentleman	She is importunate, indeed distract:
         	Her mood will needs be pitied.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	What would she have?
         
         Gentleman	She speaks much of her father; says she hears
         	There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
         	Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
         	That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
         	Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
         	The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
         	And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
         	Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
         	yield them,
         	Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
         	Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
         
         HORATIO	'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
         	Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

         	To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,

         KING CLAUDIUS	How do you, pretty lady?
         
         OPHELIA	Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
         	daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
         	what we may be. God be at your table!

         OPHELIA	Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they

         	To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
         	All in the morning betime,
         	And I a maid at your window,
         	To be your Valentine.
         	Then up he rose, and donned his clothes,
         	And dupped the chamber-door;
         	Let in the maid, that out a maid
         	Never departed more.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Pretty Ophelia!
         
         OPHELIA	Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
         
         	[Sings]
         
         	By Gis and by Saint Charity,
         	Alack, and fie for shame!
         	Young men will do't, if they come to't;
         	By cock, they are to blame.
         	Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
         	You promised me to wed.
         	So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,

         	O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
         	All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
         	When sorrows come, they come not single spies
         	But in battalions. First, her father slain:
         	Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
         	Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
         	Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
         	For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
         	In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
         	Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
         	Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
         	Last, and as much containing as all these,
         	Her brother is in secret come from France;
         	Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
         	And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
         	With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
         	Wherein necessity, of matter beggared,
         	Will nothing stick our person to arraign
         	In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
         	 to a murdering-piece, in many places
         	Gives me superfluous death.
         
         	[A noise within]
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alack, what noise is this?

         	[Enter another Gentleman]
         
         	What is the matter?
         
         Gentleman	Save yourself, my lord:
         	The ocean, overpeering of his list,
         	Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
         	Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
         	Overbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
         	And, as the world were now but to begin,
         	Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
         	The ratifiers and props of every word,
         	They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
         	Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
         	'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
         	O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	The doors are broke.

         	[Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following]
         
         LAERTES	Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
         
         Danes	No, let's come in.
         
         LAERTES	                  I pray you, give me leave.
         
         Danes	We will, we will.
         
         	[They retire without the door]
         
         LAERTES	I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
         	Give me my father!
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  Calmly, good Laertes.
         
         LAERTES	That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
         	Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
         	Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
         	Of my true mother.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	                  What is the cause, Laertes,
         	That thy rebellion looks so giant-?
         	Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
         	There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
         	That treason can but peep to what it would,
         	Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
         	Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
         	Speak, man.
         
         LAERTES	Where is my father?
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Dead.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	But not by him.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Let him demand his fill.
         
         LAERTES	How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
         	To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
         	Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!

         KING CLAUDIUS	Who shall stay you?
         
         LAERTES	My will, not all the world:
         	And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
         	They shall go far with little.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Good Laertes,
         	If you desire to know the certainty
         	Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
         	That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
         	Winner and loser?
         
         LAERTES	None but his enemies.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Will you know them then?
         
         LAERTES	To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
         	And  the kind life-rendering pelican,
         	Repast them with my blood.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Why, now you speak
         	 a good child and a true gentleman.
         	That I am guiltless of your father's death,
         	And am most sensible in grief for it,

         	they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old

         	chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
         	a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
         	them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
         	I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with

         	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
         	And you must put me in your heart for friend,
         	Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
         	That he which hath your noble father slain
         	Pursued my life.
         
         LAERTES	                  It well appears: but tell me
         	Why you proceeded not against these feats,
         	So crimeful and so capital in nature,
         	As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
         	You mainly were stirred up.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	O, for two special reasons;
         	Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinewed,
         	But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
         	Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
         	My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
         	She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
         	That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
         	I could not but by her. The other motive,
         	Why to a public count I might not go,
         	Is the great love the general gender bear him;
         	Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
         	Would,  the spring that turneth wood to stone,
         	Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
         	Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind,
         	Would have reverted to my bow again,
         	And not where I had aimed them.
         
         LAERTES	And so have I a noble father lost;
         	A sister driven into desperate terms,
         	Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
         	Stood challenger on mount of all the age
         	For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
         	That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
         	That we can let our beard be shook with danger
         	And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
         	I loved your father, and we love ourself;
         	And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--

         Messenger	Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
         	They were given me by Claudio; he received them
         	Of him that brought them.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.

         	[Reads]
         
         	'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on

         	Can you advise me?
         
         LAERTES	I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
         	It warms the very sickness in my heart,
         	That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
         	'Thus didest thou.'
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	If it be so, Laertes--
         	As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
         	Will you be ruled by me?
         
         LAERTES	Ay, my lord;
         	So you will not overrule me to a peace.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	To thine own peace. If he be now returned,
         	As checking at his voyage, and that he means
         	No more to undertake it, I will work him
         	To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
         	Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
         	And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
         	But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
         	And call it accident.
         
         LAERTES	My lord, I will be ruled;
         	The rather, if you could devise it so
         	That I might be the organ.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	It falls right.
         	You have been talked of since your travel much,
         	And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
         	Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
         	Did not together pluck such envy from him
         	As did that one, and that, in my regard,
         	Of the unworthiest siege.
         
         LAERTES	What part is that, my lord?
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	A very riband in the cap of youth,
         	Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
         	The light and careless livery that it wears
         	Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
         	Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
         	Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
         	I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
         	And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
         	Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
         	And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
         	As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
         	With the brave beast: so far he topped my thought,
         	That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
         	Come short of what he did.
         
         LAERTES	A Norman was't?
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	A Norman.
         
         LAERTES	Upon my life, Lamond.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	The very same.
         
         LAERTES	I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
         	And gem of all the nation.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	He made confession of you,
         	And gave you such a masterly report
         	For art and exercise in your defence
         	And for your rapier most especially,
         	That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
         	If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
         	He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
         	If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
         	Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
         	That he could nothing do but wish and beg
         	Your sudden coming over, to play with him.
         	Now, out of this,--
         
         LAERTES	What out of this, my lord?
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Laertes, was your father dear to you?
         	Or are you  the painting of a sorrow,
         	A face without a heart?
         
         LAERTES	Why ask you this?
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I think you did not love your father;
         	But that I know love is begun by time;
         	And that I see, in passages of proof,
         	Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
         	There lives within the very flame of love
         	A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
         	And nothing is at a  goodness still;
         	For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
         	Dies in his own too much: that we would do
         	We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
         	And hath abatements and delays as many
         	As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
         	And then this 'should' is  a spendthrift sigh,
         	That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
         	Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
         	To show yourself your father's son in deed
         	More than in words?
         
         LAERTES	To cut his throat i' the church.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
         	Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
         	Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
         	Hamlet returned shall know you are come home:
         	We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
         	And set a double varnish on the fame
         	The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
         	And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
         	Most generous and free from all contriving,
         	Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
         	Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
         	A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
         	Requite him for your father.
         
         LAERTES	I will do't:
         	And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
         	I bought an unction of a mountebank,
         	So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
         	Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
         	Collected from all simples that have virtue
         	Under the moon, can save the thing from death
         	That is but scratched withal: I'll touch my point
         	With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
         	It may be death.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	                  Let's further think of this;
         	Weigh what convenience both of time and means
         	May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
         	And that our drift look through our bad performance,
         	'Twere better not assayed: therefore this project
         	Should have a back or second, that might hold,
         	If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
         	We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
         	When in your motion you are hot and dry--
         	As make your bouts more violent to that end--
         	And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
         	A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
         	If he by chance escape your venomed stuck,
         	Our purpose may hold there.

         	So fast they follow; your sister's drowned, Laertes.
         
         LAERTES	Drowned! O, where?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
         	That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
         	There with fantastic garlands did she come
         	Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
         	That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
         	But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
         	There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
         	Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
         	When down her weedy trophies and herself
         	Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
         	And, mermaid-, awhile they bore her up:
         	Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
         	As one incapable of her own distress,
         	Or  a creature native and indued
         	Unto that element: but long it could not be
         	Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
         	Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay
         	To muddy death.
         
         LAERTES	                  Alas, then, she is drowned?
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Drowned, drowned.
         
         LAERTES	Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
         	And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
         	It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
         	Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
         	The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
         	I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
         	But that this folly douts it.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Let's follow, Gertrude:
         	How much I had to do to calm his rage!
         	Now fear I this will give it start again;
         	Therefore let's follow.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         
         
         
         	HAMLET
         
         
         ACT V
         
         
         
         SCENE I	A churchyard.
         
         
         	[Enter two Clowns, with spades, &amp;c]
         
         First Clown	Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
         	wilfully seeks her own salvation?
         
         Second Clown	I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
         	straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
         	Christian burial.
         
         First Clown	How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
         	own defence?
         
         Second Clown	Why, 'tis found so.
         
         First Clown	It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
         	here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,
         	it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
         	is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
         	herself wittingly.
         
         Second Clown	Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
         
         First Clown	Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
         	stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
         	and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
         	goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
         	and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
         	that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
         
         Second Clown	But is this law?
         
         First Clown	Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
         
         Second Clown	Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
         	a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
         	Christian burial.
         
         First Clown	Why, there thou sayest: and the more pity that
         	great folk should have countenance in this world to
         	drown or hang themselves, more than their even
         	Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
         	gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
         	they hold up Adam's profession.
         
         Second Clown	Was he a gentleman?
         
         First Clown	He was the first that ever bore arms.
         
         Second Clown	Why, he had none.
         
         First Clown	What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
         	Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
         	could he dig without arms? I'll put another
         	question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
         	purpose, confess thyself--
         
         Second Clown	Go to.
         
         First Clown	What is he that builds stronger than either the
         	mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
         
         Second Clown	The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
         	thousand tenants.
         
         First Clown	I  thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
         	does well; but how does it well? it does well to
         	those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
         	gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
         	the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
         
         Second Clown	'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
         	a carpenter?'
         
         First Clown	Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
         
         Second Clown	Marry, now I can tell.
         
         First Clown	To't.
         
         Second Clown	Mass, I cannot tell.
         
         	[Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance]
         
         First Clown	Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
         	ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
         	you are asked this question next, say 'a
         	grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
         	doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
         	stoup of liquor.
         
         	[Exit Second Clown]
         
         	[He digs and sings]
         
         	In youth, when I did love, did love,
         	Methought it was very sweet,
         	To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
         	O, methought, there was nothing meet.
         
         HAMLET	Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
         	sings at grave-making?
         
         HORATIO	Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
         
         HAMLET	'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
         	the daintier sense.
         
         First Clown	[Sings]
         
         	But age, with his stealing steps,
         	Hath clawed me in his clutch,
         	And hath shipped me intil the land,
         	As if I had never been such.
         
         	[Throws up a skull]
         
         HAMLET	That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
         	how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
         	Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
         	might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
         	now over-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
         	might it not?
         
         HORATIO	It might, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
         	sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
         	be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
         	such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
         
         HORATIO	Ay, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
         	knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
         	here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
         	see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
         	but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
         
         First Clown: [Sings]
         
         	A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
         	For and a shrouding sheet:
         	O, a pit of clay for to be made
         	For such a guest is meet.
         
         	[Throws up another skull]
         
         HAMLET	There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
         	lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
         	his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
         	suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
         	sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
         	his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
         	in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
         	his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
         	his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
         	the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
         	pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
         	no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
         	the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
         	very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
         	this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
         
         HORATIO	Not a jot more, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
         
         HORATIO	Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
         
         HAMLET	They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
         	in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
         	grave's this, sirrah?
         
         First Clown	Mine, sir.
         
         	[Sings]
         
         	O, a pit of clay for to be made
         	For such a guest is meet.
         
         HAMLET	I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
         
         First Clown	You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
         	yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
         
         HAMLET	'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
         	'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
         
         First Clown	'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
         	you.
         
         HAMLET	What man dost thou dig it for?
         
         First Clown	For no man, sir.
         
         HAMLET	What woman, then?
         
         First Clown	For none, neither.
         
         HAMLET	Who is to be buried in't?
         
         First Clown	One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
         
         HAMLET	How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
         	card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
         	Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
         	it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
         	peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
         	gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
         	grave-maker?
         
         First Clown	Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
         	that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
         
         HAMLET	How long is that since?
         
         First Clown	Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
         	was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
         	is mad, and sent into England.
         
         HAMLET	Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
         
         First Clown	Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
         	there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
         
         HAMLET	Why?
         
         First Clown	'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
         	are as mad as he.
         
         HAMLET	How came he mad?
         
         First Clown	Very strangely, they say.
         
         HAMLET	How strangely?
         
         First Clown	Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
         
         HAMLET	Upon what ground?
         
         First Clown	Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
         	and boy, thirty years.
         
         HAMLET	How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
         
         First Clown	I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
         	have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
         	hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
         	or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
         
         HAMLET	Why he more than another?
         
         First Clown	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
         	he will keep out water a great while; and your water
         	is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
         	Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
         	three and twenty years.
         
         HAMLET	Whose was it?
         
         First Clown	A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
         
         HAMLET	Nay, I know not.
         
         First Clown	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
         	flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
         	sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
         
         HAMLET	This?
         
         First Clown	E'en that.
         
         HAMLET	Let me see.
         
         	[Takes the skull]
         
         	Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
         	of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
         	borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
         	abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
         	it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
         	not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
         	gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
         	that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
         	now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
         	Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
         	her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
         	come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
         	me one thing.
         
         HORATIO	What's that, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
         	the earth?
         
         HORATIO	E'en so.
         
         HAMLET	And smelt so? pah!
         
         	[Puts down the skull]
         
         HORATIO	E'en so, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
         	not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
         	till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
         
         HORATIO	'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
         
         HAMLET	No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
         	modesty enough, and lihood to lead it: as
         	thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
         	Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
         	earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
         	was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
         	Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,
         	Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
         	O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
         	Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
         	But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
         
         	[Enter Priest, &amp;c. in procession; the Corpse of
         	OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING
         	CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, &amp;c]
         
         	The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
         	And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
         	The corse they follow did with desperate hand
         	Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
         	Couch we awhile, and mark.
         
         	[Retiring with HORATIO]
         
         LAERTES	What ceremony else?
         
         HAMLET	That is Laertes,
         	A very noble youth: mark.
         
         LAERTES	What ceremony else?
         
         First Priest	Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
         	As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
         	And, but that great command oversways the order,
         	She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
         	Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
         	Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
         	Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants,
         	Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
         	Of bell and burial.
         
         LAERTES	Must there no more be done?
         
         First Priest	No more be done:
         	We should profane the service of the dead
         	To sing a requiem and such rest to her
         	As to peace-parted souls.
         
         LAERTES	Lay her i' the earth:
         	And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
         	May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
         	A ministering angel shall my sister be,
         	When thou liest howling.
         
         HAMLET	What, the fair Ophelia!
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
         
         	[Scattering flowers]
         
         	I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
         	I thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid,
         	And not have strewed thy grave.
         
         LAERTES	O, treble woe
         	Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
         	Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
         	Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
         	Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
         
         	[Leaps into the grave]
         
         	Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
         	Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
         	To overtop old Pelion, or the skyish head
         	Of blue Olympus.
         
         HAMLET	[Advancing]     What is he whose grief
         	Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
         	Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
         	 wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
         	Hamlet the Dane.
         
         	[Leaps into the grave]
         
         LAERTES	                  The devil take thy soul!
         
         	[Grappling with him]
         
         HAMLET	Thou prayest not well.
         	I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
         	For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
         	Yet have I something in me dangerous,
         	Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Pluck them asunder.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Hamlet, Hamlet!
         
         All	Gentlemen,--
         
         HORATIO	                  Good my lord, be quiet.
         
         	[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave]
         
         HAMLET	Why I will fight with him upon this theme
         	Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	O my son, what theme?
         
         HAMLET	I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
         	Could not, with all their quantity of love,
         	Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	O, he is mad, Laertes.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	For love of God, forbear him.
         
         HAMLET	'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
         	Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
         	Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
         	I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
         	To outface me with leaping in her grave?
         	Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
         	And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
         	Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
         	Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
         	Make Ossa  a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
         	I'll rant as well as thou.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	This is mere madness:
         	And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
         	Anon, as patient as the female dove,
         	When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
         	His silence will sit drooping.
         
         HAMLET	Hear you, sir;
         	What is the reason that you use me thus?
         	I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
         	Let Hercules himself do what he may,
         	The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
         
         	[Exit HORATIO]
         
         	[To LAERTES]
         
         	Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
         	We'll put the matter to the present push.
         	Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
         	This grave shall have a living monument:
         	An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
         	Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         
         
         	HAMLET
         
         
         ACT V
         
         
         
         SCENE 	A hall in the castle.
         
         
         	[Enter HAMLET and HORATIO]
         
         HAMLET	So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
         	You do remember all the circumstance?
         
         HORATIO	Remember it, my lord?
         
         HAMLET	Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
         	That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
         	Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
         	And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
         	Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
         	When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
         	There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
         	Rough-hew them how we will,--
         
         HORATIO	That is most certain.
         
         HAMLET	Up from my cabin,
         	My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark
         	Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
         	Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrew
         	To mine own room again; making so bold,
         	My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
         	Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
         	O royal knavery!--an exact command,
         	Larded with many several sorts of reasons
         	Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
         	With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
         	That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
         	No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
         	My head should be struck off.
         
         HORATIO	Is't possible?
         
         HAMLET	Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
         	But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
         
         HORATIO	I beseech you.
         
         HAMLET	Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
         	Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
         	They had begun the play--I sat me down,
         	Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
         	I once did hold it, as our statists do,
         	A baseness to write fair and laboured much
         	How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
         	It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
         	The effect of what I wrote?
         
         HORATIO	Ay, good my lord.
         
         HAMLET	An earnest conjuration from the king,
         	As England was his faithful tributary,
         	As love between them  the palm might flourish,
         	As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
         	And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
         	And many such- 'As'es of great charge,
         	That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
         	Without debatement further, more or less,
         	He should the bearers put to sudden death,
         	Not shriving-time allowed.
         
         HORATIO	How was this sealed?
         
         HAMLET	Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
         	I had my father's signet in my purse,
         	Which was the model of that Danish seal;
         	Folded the writ up in form of the other,
         	Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
         	The changeling never known. Now, the next day
         	Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
         	Thou knowest already.
         
         HORATIO	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
         
         HAMLET	Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
         	They are not near my conscience; their defeat
         	Does by their own insinuation grow:
         	'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
         	Between the pass and fell incensed points
         	Of mighty opposites.
         
         HORATIO	Why, what a king is this!
         
         HAMLET	Does it not, thinkest thee, stand me now upon--
         	He that hath killed my king and whored my mother,
         	Popped in between the election and my hopes,
         	Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
         	And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
         	To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damned,
         	To let this canker of our nature come
         	In further evil?
         
         HORATIO	It must be shortly known to him from England
         	What is the issue of the business there.
         
         HAMLET	It will be short: the interim is mine;
         	And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
         	But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
         	That to Laertes I forgot myself;
         	For, by the image of my cause, I see
         	The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
         	But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
         	Into a towering passion.
         
         HORATIO	Peace! who comes here?
         
         	[Enter OSRIC]
         
         OSRIC	Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
         
         HAMLET	I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
         
         HORATIO	No, my good lord.
         
         HAMLET	Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
         	know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
         	beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
         	the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
         	spacious in the possession of dirt.
         
         OSRIC	Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
         	should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
         
         HAMLET	I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
         	spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
         
         OSRIC	I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
         
         HAMLET	No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
         	northerly.
         
         OSRIC	It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
         
         HAMLET	But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
         	complexion.
         
         OSRIC	Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
         	'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
         	majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
         	great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
         
         HAMLET	I beseech you, remember--
         
         	[HAMLET moves him to put on his hat]
         
         OSRIC	Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
         	Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
         	me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
         	differences, of very soft society and great showing:
         	indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
         	calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
         	continent of what part a gentleman would see.
         
         HAMLET	Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
         	though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
         	dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
         	neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
         	verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
         	great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
         	rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
         	semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
         	him, his umbrage, nothing more.
         
         OSRIC	Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
         
         HAMLET	The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
         	in our more rawer breath?
         
         OSRIC	Sir?
         
         HORATIO	Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
         	You will do't, sir, really.
         
         HAMLET	What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
         
         OSRIC	Of Laertes?
         
         HORATIO	His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
         
         HAMLET	Of him, sir.
         
         OSRIC	I know you are not ignorant--
         
         HAMLET	I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
         	it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
         
         OSRIC	You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
         
         HAMLET	I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
         	him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
         	know himself.
         
         OSRIC	I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
         	laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
         
         HAMLET	What's his weapon?
         
         OSRIC	Rapier and dagger.
         
         HAMLET	That's two of his weapons: but, well.
         
         OSRIC	The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
         	horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
         	it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
         	assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
         	carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
         	responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
         	and of very liberal conceit.
         
         HAMLET	What call you the carriages?
         
         HORATIO	I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
         
         OSRIC	The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
         
         HAMLET	The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
         	could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
         	be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
         	against six French swords, their assigns, and three
         	liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
         	against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
         
         OSRIC	The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
         	between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
         	three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
         	would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
         	would vouchsafe the answer.
         
         HAMLET	How if I answer 'no'?
         
         OSRIC	I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
         
         HAMLET	Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
         	majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
         	the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
         	king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
         	if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
         
         OSRIC	Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
         
         HAMLET	To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
         
         OSRIC	I commend my duty to your lordship.
         
         HAMLET	Yours, yours.
         
         	[Exit OSRIC]
         
         	He does well to commend it himself; there are no
         	tongues else for's turn.
         
         HORATIO	This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
         
         HAMLET	He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
         	Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
         	know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
         	the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
         	yesty collection, which carries them through and
         	through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
         	but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
         
         	[Enter a Lord]
         
         Lord	My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
         	Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
         	the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
         	play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
         
         HAMLET	I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
         	pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
         	or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
         
         Lord	The king and queen and all are coming down.
         
         HAMLET	In happy time.
         
         Lord	The queen desires you to use some gentle
         	entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
         
         HAMLET	She well instructs me.
         
         	[Exit Lord]
         
         HORATIO	You will lose this wager, my lord.
         
         HAMLET	I do not think so: since he went into France, I
         	have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
         	odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
         	about my heart: but it is no matter.
         
         HORATIO	Nay, good my lord,--
         
         HAMLET	It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
         	gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
         
         HORATIO	If your mind dis any thing, obey it: I will
         	forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
         	fit.
         
         HAMLET	Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
         	providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
         	'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
         	now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
         	readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
         	leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
         
         	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES,
         	Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &amp;c]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
         
         	[KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's]
         
         HAMLET	Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
         	But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
         	This presence knows,
         	And you must needs have heard, how I am punished
         	With sore distraction. What I have done,
         	That might your nature, honour and exception
         	Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
         	Was't Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet:
         	If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
         	And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
         	Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
         	Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
         	Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged;
         	His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
         	Sir, in this audience,
         	Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
         	Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
         	That I have shot mine arrow over the house,
         	And hurt my brother.
         
         LAERTES	I am satisfied in nature,
         	Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
         	To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
         	I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
         	Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
         	I have a voice and precedent of peace,
         	To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
         	I do receive your offered love  love,
         	And will not wrong it.
         
         HAMLET	I embrace it freely;
         	And will this brother's wager frankly play.
         	Give us the foils. Come on.
         
         LAERTES	Come, one for me.
         
         HAMLET	I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
         	Your skill shall,  a star i' the darkest night,
         	Stick fiery off indeed.
         
         LAERTES	You mock me, sir.
         
         HAMLET	No, by this hand.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
         	You know the wager?
         
         HAMLET	Very well, my lord
         	Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
         	But since he is bettered, we have therefore odds.
         
         LAERTES	This is too heavy, let me see another.
         
         HAMLET	This s me well. These foils have all a length?
         
         	[They prepare to play]
         
         OSRIC	Ay, my good lord.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
         	If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
         	Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
         	Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
         	The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
         	And in the cup an union shall he throw,
         	Richer than that which four successive kings
         	In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
         	And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
         	The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
         	The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
         	'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
         	And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
         
         HAMLET	Come on, sir.
         
         LAERTES	                  Come, my lord.
         
         	[They play]
         
         HAMLET	One.
         
         LAERTES	No.
         
         HAMLET	Judgment.
         
         OSRIC	A hit, a very palpable hit.
         
         LAERTES	Well; again.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
         	Here's to thy health.
         
         	[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within]
         
         		Give him the cup.
         
         HAMLET	I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
         
         	[They play]
         
         	Another hit; what say you?
         
         LAERTES	A touch, a touch, I do confess.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Our son shall win.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  He's fat, and scant of breath.
         	Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
         	The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
         
         HAMLET	Good madam!
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	          Gertrude, do not drink.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]  It is the poisoned cup: it is too late.
         
         HAMLET	I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	Come, let me wipe thy face.
         
         LAERTES	My lord, I'll hit him now.
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	I do not think't.
         
         LAERTES	[Aside]  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
         
         HAMLET	Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
         	I pray you, pass with your best violence;
         	I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
         
         LAERTES	Say you so? come on.
         
         	[They play]
         
         OSRIC	Nothing, neither way.
         
         LAERTES	Have at you now!
         
         	[LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they
         	change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES]
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	Part them; they are incensed.
         
         HAMLET	Nay, come, again.
         
         	[QUEEN GERTRUDE falls]
         
         OSRIC	                  Look to the queen there, ho!
         
         HORATIO	They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
         
         OSRIC	How is't, Laertes?
         
         LAERTES	Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
         	I am justly killed with mine own treachery.
         
         HAMLET	How does the queen?
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	She swounds to see them bleed.
         
         QUEEN GERTRUDE	No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
         	The drink, the drink! I am poisoned.
         
         	[Dies]
         
         HAMLET	O villany! Ho! let the door be locked:
         	Treachery! Seek it out.
         
         LAERTES	It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
         	No medicine in the world can do thee good;
         	In thee there is not half an hour of life;
         	The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
         	Unbated and envenomed: the foul practise
         	Hath turned itself on me lo, here I lie,
         	Never to rise again: thy mother's poisoned:
         	I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
         
         HAMLET	The point!--envenomed too!
         	Then, venom, to thy work.
         
         	[Stabs KING CLAUDIUS]
         
         All	Treason! treason!
         
         KING CLAUDIUS	O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
         
         HAMLET	Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
         	Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
         	Follow my mother.
         
         	[KING CLAUDIUS dies]
         
         LAERTES	                  He is justly served;
         	It is a poison tempered by himself.
         	Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
         	Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
         	Nor thine on me.
         
         	[Dies]
         
         HAMLET	Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
         	I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
         	You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
         	That are but mutes or audience to this act,
         	Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
         	Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
         	But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
         	Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
         	To the unsatisfied.
         
         HORATIO	Never believe it:
         	I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
         	Here's yet some liquor left.
         
         HAMLET	As thou'rt a man,
         	Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
         	O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
         	Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
         	If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
         	Absent thee from felicity awhile,
         	And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
         	To tell my story.
         
         	[March afar off, and shot within]
         
         	What war noise is this?
         
         OSRIC	Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
         	To the ambassadors of England gives
         	This war volley.
         
         HAMLET	O, I die, Horatio;
         	The potent poison quite over-crows my spirit:
         	I cannot live to hear the news from England;
         	But I do prophesy the election lights
         	On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
         	So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
         	Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
         
         	[Dies]
         
         HORATIO	Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
         	And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
         	Why does the drum come hither?
         
         	[March within]
         
         	[Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,
         	and others]
         
         PRINCE FORTINBRAS	Where is this sight?
         
         HORATIO	What is it ye would see?
         	If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
         
         PRINCE FORTINBRAS	This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
         	What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
         	That thou so many princes at a shot
         	So bloodily hast struck?
         
         First Ambassador	The sight is dismal;
         	And our affairs from England come too late:
         	The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
         	To tell him his commandment is fulfilled,
         	That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
         	Where should we have our thanks?
         
         HORATIO	Not from his mouth,
         	Had it the ability of life to thank you:
         	He never gave commandment for their death.
         	But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
         	You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
         	Are here arrived give order that these bodies
         	High on a stage be placed to the view;
         	And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
         	How these things came about: so shall you hear
         	Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
         	Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
         	Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
         	And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
         	Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
         	Truly deliver.
         
         PRINCE FORTINBRAS	                  Let us haste to hear it,
         	And call the noblest to the audience.
         	For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
         	I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
         	Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
         
         HORATIO	Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
         	And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
         	But let this same be presently performed,
         	Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
         	On plots and errors, happen.
         
         PRINCE FORTINBRAS	Let four captains
         	Bear Hamlet,  a soldier, to the stage;
         	For he was ly, had he been put on,
         	To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
         	The soldiers' music and the rites of war
         	Speak loudly for him.
         	Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
         	Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
         	Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
         
         	[A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead
         	bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off]

         	[Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners]
         
         FLAVIUS	Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
         	Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
         	Being mechanical, you ought not walk
         	Upon a labouring day without the sign
         	Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
         
         First Commoner	Why, sir, a carpenter.
         
         MARULLUS	Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
         	What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
         	You, sir, what trade are you?
         
         Second Commoner	Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
         	as you would say, a cobbler.
         
         MARULLUS	But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
         
         Second Commoner	A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
         	conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
         
         MARULLUS	What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?
         
         Second Commoner	Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
         	if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
         
         MARULLUS	What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!
         
         Second Commoner	Why, sir, cobble you.
         
         FLAVIUS	Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
         
         Second Commoner	Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
         	meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
         	matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
         	to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
         	recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
         	neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
         
         FLAVIUS	But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
         	Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
         
         Second Commoner	Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
         	into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
         	to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
         
         MARULLUS	Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
         	What tributaries follow him to Rome,
         	To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
         	You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
         	O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
         	Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
         	Have you climbed up to walls and battlements,
         	To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
         	Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
         	The livelong day, with patient expectation,
         	To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
         	And when you saw his chariot but appear,
         	Have you not made an universal shout,
         	That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
         	To hear the replication of your sounds
         	Made in her concave shores?
         	And do you now put on your best attire?
         	And do you now cull out a holiday?
         	And do you now strew flowers in his way
         	That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
         	Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
         	Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
         	That needs must light on this ingratitude.
         
         FLAVIUS	Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
         	Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
         	Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
         	Into the channel, till the lowest stream
         	Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
         
         	[Exeunt all the Commoners]
         
         	See whether their basest metal be not moved;
         	They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
         	Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
         	This way will I	disrobe the images,
         	If you do find them decked with ceremonies.
         
         MARULLUS	May we do so?
         	You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
         
         FLAVIUS	It is no matter; let no images
         	Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
         	And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
         	So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
         	These growing feathers plucked from Caesar's wing
         	Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
         	Who else would soar above the view of men
         	And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE 	A public place.
         
         
         
         	[Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;
         	CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,
         	CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among
         	them a Soothsayer]
         
         CAESAR	Calpurnia!
         
         CASCA	         Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
         
         CAESAR	Calpurnia!
         
         CALPURNIA	Here, my lord.
         
         CAESAR	Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
         	When he doth run his course. Antonius!
         
         ANTONY	Caesar, my lord?
         
         CAESAR	Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
         	To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
         	The barren, touched in this holy chase,
         	Shake off their sterile curse.
         
         ANTONY	I shall remember:
         	When Caesar says edo this,' it is performed.
         
         CAESAR	Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
         
         	[Flourish]
         
         Soothsayer	Caesar!
         
         CAESAR	Ha! who calls?
         
         CASCA	Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
         
         CAESAR	Who is it in the press that calls on me?
         	I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
         	Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turned to hear.
         
         Soothsayer	Beware the ides of March.
         
         CAESAR	What man is that?
         
         BRUTUS	A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
         
         CAESAR	Set him before me; let me see his face.
         
         CASSIUS	Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
         
         CAESAR	What sayest thou to me now? speak once again.
         
         Soothsayer	Beware the ides of March.
         
         CAESAR	He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
         
         	[Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS]
         
         CASSIUS	Will you go see the order of the course?
         
         BRUTUS	Not I.
         
         CASSIUS	I pray you, do.
         
         BRUTUS	I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
         	Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
         	Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
         	I'll leave you.
         
         CASSIUS	Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
         	I have not from your eyes that gentleness
         	And show of love as I was wont to have:
         	You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
         	Over your friend that loves you.
         
         BRUTUS	Cassius,
         	Be not deceived: if I have veiled my look,
         	I turn the trouble of my countenance
         	Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
         	Of late with passions of some difference,
         	Conceptions only proper to myself,
         	Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
         	But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
         	Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
         	Nor construe any further my neglect,
         	Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
         	Forgets the shows of love to other men.
         
         CASSIUS	Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
         	By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
         	Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
         	Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
         
         BRUTUS	No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
         	But by reflection, by some other things.
         
         CASSIUS	'Tis just:
         	And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
         	That you have no such mirrors as will turn
         	Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
         	That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
         	Where many of the best respect in Rome,
         	Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
         	And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
         	Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.
         
         BRUTUS	Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
         	That you would have me seek into myself
         	For that which is not in me?
         
         CASSIUS	Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
         	And since you know you cannot see yourself
         	So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
         	Will modestly discover to yourself
         	That of yourself which you yet know not of.
         	And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
         	Were I a common laugher, or did use
         	To stale with ordinary oaths my love
         	To every new protester; if you know
         	That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
         	And after scandal them, or if you know
         	That I profess myself in banqueting
         	To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
         
         	[Flourish, and shout]
         
         BRUTUS	What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
         	Choose Caesar for their king.
         
         CASSIUS	Ay, do you fear it?
         	Then must I think you would not have it so.
         
         BRUTUS	I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
         	But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
         	What is it that you would impart to me?
         	If it be aught toward the general good,
         	Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
         	And I will look on both indifferently,
         	For let the gods so speed me as I love
         	The name of honour more than I fear death.
         
         CASSIUS	I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
         	As well as I do know your outward favour.
         	Well, honour is the subject of my story.
         	I cannot tell what you and other men
         	Think of this life; but, for my single self,
         	I had as lief not be as live to be
         	In awe of such a thing as I myself.
         	I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
         	We both have fed as well, and we can both
         	Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
         	For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
         	The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
         	Caesar said to me edarest thou, Cassius, now
         	Leap in with me into this angry flood,
         	And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
         	Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
         	And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
         	The torrent roared, and we did buffet it
         	With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
         	And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
         	But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
         	Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
         	I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
         	Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
         	The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
         	Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
         	Is now become a god, and Cassius is
         	A wretched creature and must bend his body,
         	If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
         	He had a fever when he was in Spain,
         	And when the fit was on him, I did mark
         	How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
         	His coward lips did from their colour fly,
         	And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
         	Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
         	Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
         	Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
         	Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
         	As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
         	A man of such a feeble temper should
         	So get the start of the majestic world
         	And bear the palm alone.
         
         	[Shout. Flourish]
         
         BRUTUS	Another general shout!
         	I do believe that these applauses are
         	For some new honours that are heaped on Caesar.
         
         CASSIUS	Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
         	 a Colossus, and we petty men
         	Walk under his huge legs and peep about
         	To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
         	Men at some time are masters of their fates:
         	The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
         	But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
         	Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
         	Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
         	Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
         	Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
         	Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
         	Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
         	Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
         	Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
         	That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
         	Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
         	When went there by an age, since the great flood,
         	But it was famed with more than with one man?
         	When could they say till now, that talked of Rome,
         	That her wide walls encompassed but one man?
         	Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
         	When there is in it but one only man.
         	O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
         	There was a Brutus once that would have brooked
         	The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
         	As easily as a king.
         
         BRUTUS	That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
         	What you would work me to, I have some aim:
         	How I have thought of this and of these times,
         	I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
         	I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
         	Be any further moved. What you have said
         	I will consider; what you have to say
         	I will with patience hear, and find a time
         	Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
         	Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
         	Brutus had rather be a villager
         	Than to repute himself a son of Rome
         	Under these hard conditions as this time
         	Is  to lay upon us.
         
         CASSIUS	I am glad that my weak words
         	Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
         
         BRUTUS	The games are done and Caesar is returning.
         
         CASSIUS	As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
         	And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
         	What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
         
         	[Re-enter CAESAR and his Train]
         
         BRUTUS	I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
         	The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
         	And all the rest look  a chidden train:
         	Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
         	Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
         	As we have seen him in the Capitol,
         	Being crossed in conference by some senators.
         
         CASSIUS	Casca will tell us what the matter is.
         
         CAESAR	Antonius!
         
         ANTONY	Caesar?
         
         CAESAR	Let me have men about me that are fat;
         	Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
         	Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
         	He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
         
         ANTONY	Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
         	He is a noble Roman and well given.
         
         CAESAR	Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
         	Yet if my name were liable to fear,
         	I do not know the man I should avoid
         	So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
         	He is a great observer and he looks
         	Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
         	As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
         	Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
         	As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit
         	That could be moved to smile at any thing.
         	Such men as he be never at heart's ease
         	Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
         	And therefore are they very dangerous.
         	I rather tell thee what is to be feared
         	Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
         	Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
         	And tell me truly what thou thinkest of him.
         
         	[Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA]
         
         CASCA	You pulled me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
         
         BRUTUS	Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
         	That Caesar looks so sad.
         
         CASCA	Why, you were with him, were you not?
         
         BRUTUS	I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
         
         CASCA	Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
         	offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
         	thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
         
         BRUTUS	What was the second noise for?
         
         CASCA	Why, for that too.
         
         CASSIUS	They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
         
         CASCA	Why, for that too.
         
         BRUTUS	Was the crown offered him thrice?
         
         CASCA	Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
         	time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
         	mine honest neighbours shouted.
         
         CASSIUS	Who offered him the crown?
         
         CASCA	Why, Antony.
         
         BRUTUS	Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
         
         CASCA	I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
         	it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
         	Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
         	neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
         	you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
         	thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
         	offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
         	but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
         	fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
         	time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
         	refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
         	chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
         	and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
         	Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
         	Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
         	for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
         	opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
         
         CASSIUS	But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
         
         CASCA	He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
         	mouth, and was speechless.
         
         BRUTUS	'Tis very : he hath the failing sickness.
         
         CASSIUS	No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
         	And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
         
         CASCA	I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
         	Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
         	clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
         	displeased them, as they use to do the players in
         	the theatre, I am no true man.
         
         BRUTUS	What said he when he came unto himself?
         
         CASCA	Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
         	common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
         	plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
         	throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
         	occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
         	I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
         	he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
         	If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
         	their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
         	or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
         	soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
         	there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
         	stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
         
         BRUTUS	And after that, he came, thus sad, away?
         
         CASCA	Ay.
         
         CASSIUS	Did Cicero say any thing?
         
         CASCA	Ay, he spoke Greek.
         
         CASSIUS	To what effect?
         
         CASCA	Nay, an I tell you that, Ill never look you i' the
         	face again: but those that understood him smiled at
         	one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
         	part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
         	news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
         	off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
         	well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
         	remember it.
         
         CASSIUS	Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
         
         CASCA	No, I am promised forth.
         
         CASSIUS	Will you dine with me to-morrow?
         
         CASCA	Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
         	worth the eating.
         
         CASSIUS	Good: I will expect you.
         
         CASCA	Do so. Farewell, both.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BRUTUS	What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
         	He was quick mettle when he went to school.
         
         CASSIUS	So is he now in execution
         	Of any bold or noble enterprise,
         	However he puts on this tardy form.
         	This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
         	Which gives men stomach to digest his words
         	With better appetite.
         
         BRUTUS	And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
         	To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
         	I will come home to you; or, if you will,
         	Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
         
         CASSIUS	I will do so: till then, think of the world.
         
         	[Exit BRUTUS]
         
         	Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
         	Thy honourable metal may be wrought
         	From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
         	That noble minds keep ever with their s;
         	For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
         	Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
         	If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
         	He should not humour me. I will this night,
         	In several hands, in at his windows throw,
         	As if they came from several citizens,
         	Writings all tending to the great opinion
         	That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
         	Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
         	And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
         	For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         
         
         
         	JULIUS CAESAR
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	The same. A street.
         
         
         
         
         	[Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides,
         	CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO]
         
         CICERO	Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
         	Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
         
         CASCA	Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
         	Shakes  a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
         	I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
         	Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
         	The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
         	To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
         	But never till to-night, never till now,
         	Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
         	Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
         	Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
         	Incenses them to send destruction.
         
         CICERO	Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?
         
         CASCA	A common slave--you know him well by sight--
         	Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
         	 twenty torches joined, and yet his hand,
         	Not sensible of fire, remained unscorched.
         	Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
         	Against the Capitol I met a lion,
         	Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
         	Without annoying me: and there were drawn
         	Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
         	Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
         	Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
         	And yesterday the bird of night did sit
         	Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
         	Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
         	Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
         	'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
         	For, I believe, they are portentous things
         	Unto the climate that they point upon.
         
         CICERO	Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
         	But men may construe things after their fashion,
         	Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
         	Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
         
         CASCA	He doth; for he did bid Antonius
         	Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
         
         CICERO	Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
         	Is not to walk in.
         
         CASCA	Farewell, Cicero.
         
         	[Exit CICERO]
         
         	[Enter CASSIUS]
         
         CASSIUS	Who's there?
         
         CASCA	                  A Roman.
         
         CASSIUS	Casca, by your voice.
         
         CASCA	Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
         
         CASSIUS	A very pleasing night to honest men.
         
         CASCA	Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
         
         CASSIUS	Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
         	For my part, I have walked about the streets,
         	Submitting me unto the perilous night,
         	And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
         	Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
         	And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open
         	The breast of heaven, I did present myself
         	Even in the aim and very flash of it.
         
         CASCA	But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
         	It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
         	When the most mighty gods by tokens send
         	Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
         
         CASSIUS	You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
         	That should be in a Roman you do want,
         	Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
         	And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
         	To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
         	But if you would consider the true cause
         	Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
         	Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
         	Why old men fool and children calculate,
         	Why all these things change from their ordinance
         	Their natures and preformed faculties
         	To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
         	That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
         	To make them instruments of fear and warning
         	Unto some monstrous state.
         	Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
         	Most  this dreadful night,
         	That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
         	As doth the lion in the Capitol,
         	A man no mightier than thyself or me
         	In personal action, yet prodigious grown
         	And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
         
         CASCA	'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
         
         CASSIUS	Let it be who it is: for Romans now
         	Have thews and limbs  to their ancestors;
         	But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
         	And we are governed with our mothers' spirits;
         	Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
         
         CASCA	Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
         	Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
         	And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
         	In every place, save here in Italy.
         
         CASSIUS	I know where I will wear this dagger then;
         	Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
         	Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
         	Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
         	Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
         	Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
         	Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
         	But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
         	Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
         	If I know this, know all the world besides,
         	That part of tyranny that I do bear
         	I can shake off at pleasure.
         
         	[Thunder still]
         
         CASCA	So can I:
         	So every bondman in his own hand bears
         	The power to cancel his captivity.
         
         CASSIUS	And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
         	Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
         	But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
         	He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
         	Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
         	Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
         	What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
         	For the base matter to illuminate
         	So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
         	Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
         	Before a willing bondman; then I know
         	My answer must be made. But I am armed,
         	And dangers are to me indifferent.
         
         CASCA	You speak to Casca, and to such a man
         	That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
         	Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
         	And I will set this foot of mine as far
         	As who goes farthest.
         
         CASSIUS	There's a bargain made.
         	Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
         	Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
         	To undergo with me an enterprise
         	Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
         	And I do know, by this, they stay for me
         	In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
         	There is no stir or walking in the streets;
         	And the complexion of the element
         	In favour's  the work we have in hand,
         	Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
         
         CASCA	Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
         
         CASSIUS	'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
         	He is a friend.
         
         	[Enter CINNA]
         
         	Cinna, where haste you so?
         
         CINNA	To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
         
         CASSIUS	No, it is Casca; one incorporate
         	To our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna?
         
         CINNA	I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
         	There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
         
         CASSIUS	Am I not stayed for? tell me.
         
         CINNA	Yes, you are.
         	O Cassius, if you could
         	But win the noble Brutus to our party--
         
         CASSIUS	Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
         	And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
         	Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
         	In at his window; set this up with wax
         	Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
         	Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
         	Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
         
         CINNA	All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
         	To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
         	And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
         
         CASSIUS	That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
         
         	[Exit CINNA]
         
         	Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
         	See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
         	Is ours already, and the man entire
         	Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
         
         CASCA	O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
         	And that which would appear offence in us,
         	His countenance,  richest alchemy,
         	Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
         
         CASSIUS	Him and his worth and our great need of him
         	You have right well conceited. Let us go,
         	For it is after midnight; and ere day
         	We will awake him and be sure of him.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.
         
         
         	[Enter BRUTUS]
         
         BRUTUS	What, Lucius, ho!
         	I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
         	Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
         	I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
         	When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!
         
         	[Enter LUCIUS]
         
         LUCIUS	Called you, my lord?
         
         BRUTUS	Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
         	When it is lighted, come and call me here.
         
         LUCIUS	I will, my lord.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BRUTUS	It must be by his death: and for my part,
         	I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
         	But for the general. He would be crowned:
         	How that might change his nature, there's the question.
         	It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
         	And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
         	And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
         	That at his will he may do danger with.
         	The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
         	Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
         	I have not known when his affections swayed
         	More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
         	That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
         	Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
         	But when he once attains the upmost round.
         	He then unto the ladder turns his back,
         	Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
         	By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
         	Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
         	Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
         	Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
         	Would run to these and these extremities:
         	And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
         	Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
         	And kill him in the shell.
         
         	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
         
         LUCIUS	The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
         	Searching the window for a flint, I found
         	This paper, thus sealed up; and, I am sure,
         	It did not lie there when I went to bed.
         
         	[Gives him the letter]
         
         BRUTUS	Get you to bed again; it is not day.
         	Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?
         
         LUCIUS	I know not, sir.
         
         BRUTUS	Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
         
         LUCIUS	I will, sir.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BRUTUS	The exhalations whizzing in the air
         	Give so much light that I may read by them.
         
         	[Opens the letter and reads]
         
         	'Brutus, thou sleepest: awake, and see thyself.
         	Shall Rome, &amp;c. Speak, strike, redress!
         	Brutus, thou sleepest: awake!'
         	Such instigations have been often dropped
         	Where I have took them up.
         	'Shall Rome, &amp;c.' Thus must I piece it out:
         	Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
         	My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
         	The Tarquin drive, when he was called a king.
         	'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
         	To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
         	If the redress will follow, thou receivest
         	Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
         
         	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
         
         LUCIUS	Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
         
         	[Knocking within]
         
         BRUTUS	'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
         
         	[Exit LUCIUS]
         
         	Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
         	I have not slept.
         	Between the acting of a dreadful thing
         	And the first motion, all the interim is
         	 a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
         	The Genius and the mortal instruments
         	Are then in council; and the state of man,
         	 to a little kingdom, suffers then
         	The nature of an insurrection.
         
         	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
         
         LUCIUS	Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
         	Who doth desire to see you.
         
         BRUTUS	Is he alone?
         
         LUCIUS	No, sir, there are moe with him.
         
         BRUTUS	Do you know them?
         
         LUCIUS	No, sir; their hats are plucked about their ears,
         	And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
         	That by no means I may discover them
         	By any mark of favour.
         
         BRUTUS	Let 'em enter.
         
         	[Exit LUCIUS]
         
         	They are the faction. O conspiracy,
         	Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
         	When evils are most free? O, then by day
         	Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
         	To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
         	Hide it in smiles and affability:
         	For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
         	Not Erebus itself were dim enough
         	To hide thee from prevention.
         
         	[Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS
         	BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS]
         
         CASSIUS	I think we are too bold upon your rest:
         	Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
         
         BRUTUS	I have been up this hour, awake all night.
         	Know I these men that come along with you?
         
         CASSIUS	Yes, every man of them, and no man here
         	But honours you; and every one doth wish
         	You had but that opinion of yourself
         	Which every noble Roman bears of you.
         	This is Trebonius.
         
         BRUTUS	                  He is welcome hither.
         
         CASSIUS	This, Decius Brutus.
         
         BRUTUS	He is welcome too.
         
         CASSIUS	This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
         
         BRUTUS	They are all welcome.
         	What watchful cares do interpose themselves
         	Betwixt your eyes and night?
         
         CASSIUS	Shall I entreat a word?
         
         	[BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper]
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
         
         CASCA	No.
         
         CINNA	O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
         	That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
         
         CASCA	You shall confess that you are both deceived.
         	Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
         	Which is a great way growing on the south,
         	Weighing the youthful season of the year.
         	Some two months hence up higher toward the north
         	He first presents his fire; and the high east
         	Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
         
         BRUTUS	Give me your hands all over, one by one.
         
         CASSIUS	And let us swear our resolution.
         
         BRUTUS	No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
         	The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
         	If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
         	And every man hence to his idle bed;
         	So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
         	Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
         	As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
         	To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
         	The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
         	What need we any spur but our own cause,
         	To prick us to redress? what other bond
         	Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
         	And will not palter? and what other oath
         	Than honesty to honesty engaged,
         	That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
         	Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
         	Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
         	That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
         	Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
         	The even virtue of our enterprise,
         	Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
         	To think that or our cause or our performance
         	Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
         	That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
         	Is guilty of a several bastardy,
         	If he do break the smallest particle
         	Of any promise that hath passed from him.
         
         CASSIUS	But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
         	I think he will stand very strong with us.
         
         CASCA	Let us not leave him out.
         
         CINNA	No, by no means.
         
         METELLUS CIMBER	O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
         	Will purchase us a good opinion
         	And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
         	It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
         	Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
         	But all be buried in his gravity.
         
         BRUTUS	O, name him not: let us not break with him;
         	For he will never follow any thing
         	That other men begin.
         
         CASSIUS	Then leave him out.
         
         CASCA	Indeed he is not fit.
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	Shall no man else be touched but only Caesar?
         
         CASSIUS	Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
         	Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
         	Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
         	A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
         	If he improve them, may well stretch so far
         	As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
         	Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
         
         BRUTUS	Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
         	To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
         	 wrath in death and envy afterwards;
         	For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
         	Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
         	We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
         	And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
         	O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
         	And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
         	Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
         	Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
         	Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
         	Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
         	And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
         	Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
         	And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
         	Our purpose necessary and not envious:
         	Which so appearing to the common eyes,
         	We shall be called purgers, not murderers.
         	And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
         	For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
         	When Caesar's head is off.
         
         CASSIUS	Yet I fear him;
         	For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
         
         BRUTUS	Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
         	If he love Caesar, all that he can do
         	Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
         	And that were much he should; for he is given
         	To sports, to wildness and much company.
         
         TREBONIUS	There is no fear in him; let him not die;
         	For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
         
         	[Clock strikes]
         
         BRUTUS	Peace! count the clock.
         
         CASSIUS	The clock hath stricken three.
         
         TREBONIUS	'Tis time to part.
         
         CASSIUS	                  But it is doubtful yet,
         	Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
         	For he is superstitious grown of late,
         	Quite from the main opinion he held once
         	Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
         	It may be, these apparent prodigies,
         	The unaccustomed terror of this night,
         	And the persuasion of his augurers,
         	May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
         	I can oversway him; for he loves to hear
         	That unicorns may be betrayed with trees,
         	And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
         	Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
         	But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
         	He says he does, being then most flattered.
         	Let me work;
         	For I can give his humour the true bent,
         	And I will bring him to the Capitol.
         
         CASSIUS	Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
         
         BRUTUS	By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
         
         CINNA	Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
         
         METELLUS CIMBER	Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
         	Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
         	I wonder none of you have thought of him.
         
         BRUTUS	Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
         	He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
         	Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
         
         CASSIUS	The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
         	And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
         	What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
         
         BRUTUS	Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
         	Let not our looks put on our purposes,
         	But bear it as our Roman actors do,
         	With untired spirits and formal constancy:
         	And so good morrow to you every one.
         
         	[Exeunt all but BRUTUS]
         
         	Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
         	Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
         	Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
         	Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
         	Therefore thou sleepest so sound.
         
         	[Enter PORTIA]
         
         PORTIA	Brutus, my lord!
         
         BRUTUS	Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
         	It is not for your health thus to commit
         	Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
         
         PORTIA	Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
         	Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
         	You suddenly arose, and walked about,
         	Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
         	And when I asked you what the matter was,
         	You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
         	I urged you further; then you scratched your head,
         	And too impatiently stamped with your foot;
         	Yet I insisted, yet you answered not,
         	But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
         	Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
         	Fearing to strengthen that impatience
         	Which seemed too much enkindled, and withal
         	Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
         	Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
         	It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
         	And could it work so much upon your shape
         	As it hath much prevailed on your condition,
         	I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
         	Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
         
         BRUTUS	I am not well in health, and that is all.
         
         PORTIA	Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
         	He would embrace the means to come by it.
         
         BRUTUS	Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
         
         PORTIA	Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
         	To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
         	Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
         	And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
         	To dare the vile contagion of the night
         	And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
         	To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
         	You have some sick offence within your mind,
         	Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
         	I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
         	I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
         	By all your vows of love and that great vow
         	Which did incorporate and make us one,
         	That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
         	Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
         	Have had to resort to you: for here have been
         	Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
         	Even from darkness.
         
         BRUTUS	Kneel not, gentle Portia.
         
         PORTIA	I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
         	Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
         	Is it excepted I should know no secrets
         	That appertain to you? Am I yourself
         	But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
         	To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
         	And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
         	Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
         	Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
         
         BRUTUS	You are my true and honourable wife,
         	As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
         	That visit my sad heart
         
         PORTIA	If this were true, then should I know this secret.
         	I grant I am a woman; but withal
         	A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
         	I grant I am a woman; but withal
         	A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
         	Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
         	Being so fathered and so husbanded?
         	Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
         	I have made strong proof of my constancy,
         	Giving myself a voluntary wound
         	Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
         	And not my husband's secrets?
         
         BRUTUS	O ye gods,
         
         	Render me worthy of this noble wife!
         
         	[Knocking within]
         
         	Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
         	And by and by thy bosom shall partake
         	The secrets of my heart.
         	All my engagements I will construe to thee,
         	All the charactery of my sad brows:
         	Leave me with haste.
         
         	[Exit PORTIA]
         
         		Lucius, who's that knocks?
         
         	[Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS]
         
         LUCIUS	He is a sick man that would speak with you.
         
         BRUTUS	Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
         	Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?
         
         LIGARIUS	Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
         
         BRUTUS	O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
         	To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
         
         LIGARIUS	I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
         	Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
         
         BRUTUS	Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
         	Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
         
         LIGARIUS	By all the gods that Romans bow before,
         	I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
         	Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
         	Thou,  an exorcist, hast conjured up
         	My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
         	And I will strive with things impossible;
         	Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
         
         BRUTUS	A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
         
         LIGARIUS	But are not some whole that we must make sick?
         
         BRUTUS	That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
         	I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
         	To whom it must be done.
         
         LIGARIUS	Set on your foot,
         	And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
         	To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
         	That Brutus leads me on.
         
         BRUTUS	Follow me, then.

         	[Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his
         	night-gown]
         
         CAESAR	Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
         	Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
         	'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?
         
         	[Enter a Servant]
         
         Servant	My lord?
         
         CAESAR	Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
         	And bring me their opinions of success.
         
         Servant	I will, my lord.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         	[Enter CALPURNIA]
         
         CALPURNIA	What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?
         	You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
         
         CAESAR	Caesar shall forth: the things that threatened me
         	never looked but on my back; when they shall see
         	The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
         
         CALPURNIA	Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
         	Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
         	Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
         	Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
         	A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
         	And graves have yawned, and yielded up their dead;
         	Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
         	In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
         	Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
         	The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
         	Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
         	And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
         	O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
         	And I do fear them.
         
         CAESAR	What can be avoided
         	Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
         	Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
         	Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
         
         CALPURNIA	When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
         	The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
         
         CAESAR	Cowards die many times before their deaths;
         	The valiant never taste of death but once.
         	Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
         	It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
         	Seeing that death, a necessary end,
         	Will come when it will come.
         
         	[Re-enter Servant]
         
         		       What say the augurers?
         
         Servant	They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
         	Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
         	They could not find a heart within the beast.
         
         CAESAR	The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
         	Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
         	If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
         	No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
         	That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
         	We are two lions littered in one day,
         	And I the elder and more terrible:
         	And Caesar shall go forth.
         
         CALPURNIA	Alas, my lord,
         	Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
         	Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
         	That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
         	We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
         	And he shall say you are not well to-day:
         	Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
         
         CAESAR	Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
         	And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
         
         	[Enter DECIUS BRUTUS]
         
         	Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:
         	I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
         
         CAESAR	And you are come in very happy time,
         	To bear my greeting to the senators
         	And tell them that I will not come to-day:
         	Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
         	I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.
         
         CALPURNIA	Say he is sick.
         
         CAESAR	                  Shall Caesar send a lie?
         	Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far,
         	To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
         	Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
         	Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.
         
         CAESAR	The cause is in my will: I will not come;
         	That is enough to satisfy the senate.
         	But for your private satisfaction,
         	Because I love you, I will let you know:
         	Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
         	She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
         	Which,  a fountain with an hundred spouts,
         	Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
         	Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
         	And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
         	And evils imminent; and on her knee
         	Hath begged that I will stay at home to-day.
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	This dream is all amiss interpreted;
         	It was a vision fair and fortunate:
         	Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
         	In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
         	Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
         	Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
         	For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
         	This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
         
         CAESAR	And this way have you well expounded it.
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	I have, when you have heard what I can say:
         	And know it now: the senate have concluded
         	To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
         	If you shall send them word you will not come,
         	Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
         	Apt to be rendered, for some one to say
         	'Break up the senate till another time,
         	When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
         	If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
         	'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
         	Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
         	To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
         	And reason to my love is liable.
         
         CAESAR	How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
         	I am ashamed I did yield to them.
         	Give me my robe, for I will go.
         
         	[Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA,
         	TREBONIUS, and CINNA]
         
         	And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
         
         PUBLIUS	Good morrow, Caesar.
         
         CAESAR	Welcome, Publius.
         	What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?
         	Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
         	Caesar was never so much your enemy
         	As that same ague which hath made you lean.
         	What is 't o'clock?
         
         BRUTUS	Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
         
         CAESAR	I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
         
         	[Enter ANTONY]
         
         	See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
         	Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.
         
         ANTONY	So to most noble Caesar.
         
         CAESAR	Bid them prepare within:
         	I am to blame to be thus waited for.
         	Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
         	I have an hour's talk in store for you;
         	Remember that you call on me to-day:
         	Be near me, that I may remember you.
         
         TREBONIUS	Caesar, I will:
         
         	[Aside]
         
         	and so near will I be,
         	That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
         
         CAESAR	Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
         	And we,  friends, will straightway go together.
         
         BRUTUS	[Aside]  That every  is not the same, O Caesar,
         	The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!

         SCENE I	A street near the Capitol.
         
         
         	[Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper]
         
         ARTEMIDORUS	'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;
         	come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not
         	Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
         	loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
         	There is but one mind in all these men, and it is
         	bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,
         	look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
         	The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
         		'ARTEMIDORUS.'
         	Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
         	And as a suitor will I give him this.
         	My heart laments that virtue cannot live
         	Out of the teeth of emulation.
         	If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;
         	If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

         SCENE 	Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.
         
         
         	[Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS]
         
         PORTIA	I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;
         	Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
         	Why dost thou stay?
         
         LUCIUS	To know my errand, madam.
         
         PORTIA	I would have had thee there, and here again,
         	Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
         	O constancy, be strong upon my side,
         	Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
         	I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
         	How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
         	Art thou here yet?
         
         LUCIUS	                  Madam, what should I do?
         	Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
         	And so return to you, and nothing else?
         
         PORTIA	Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
         	For he went sickly forth: and take good note
         	What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
         	Hark, boy! what noise is that?
         
         LUCIUS	I hear none, madam.
         
         PORTIA	Prithee, listen well;
         	I heard a bustling rumour,  a fray,
         	And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
         
         LUCIUS	Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
         
         	[Enter the Soothsayer]
         
         PORTIA	Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?
         
         Soothsayer	At mine own house, good lady.
         
         PORTIA	What is't o'clock?
         
         Soothsayer	                  About the ninth hour, lady.
         
         PORTIA	Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
         
         Soothsayer	Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
         	To see him pass on to the Capitol.
         
         PORTIA	Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
         
         Soothsayer	That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
         	To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
         	I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
         
         PORTIA	Why, knowest thou any harm's intended towards him?
         
         Soothsayer	None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
         	Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
         	The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
         	Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
         	Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
         	I'll get me to a place more void, and there
         	Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         PORTIA	I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
         	The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
         	The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
         	Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
         	That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
         	Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
         	Say I am merry: come to me again,
         	And bring me word what he doth say to thee.

         CAESAR	[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.
         
         Soothsayer	Ay, Caesar; but not gone.
         
         ARTEMIDORUS	Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	Trebonius doth desire you to overread,
         	At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
         
         ARTEMIDORUS	O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
         	That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.
         
         CAESAR	What touches us ourself shall be last served.
         
         ARTEMIDORUS	Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
         
         CAESAR	What, is the fellow mad?
         
         PUBLIUS	Sirrah, give place.
         
         CASSIUS	What, urge you your petitions in the street?
         	Come to the Capitol.
         
         	[CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest
         	following]
         
         POPILIUS	I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
         
         CASSIUS	What enterprise, Popilius?
         
         POPILIUS	Fare you well.
         
         	[Advances to CAESAR]
         
         BRUTUS	What said Popilius Lena?
         
         CASSIUS	He wished to-day our enterprise might thrive.
         	I fear our purpose is discovered.
         
         BRUTUS	Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.
         
         CASSIUS	Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
         	Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
         	Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
         	For I will slay myself.
         
         BRUTUS	Cassius, be constant:
         	Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
         	For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
         
         CASSIUS	Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.
         	He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
         
         	[Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS]
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
         	And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
         
         BRUTUS	He is addressed: press near and second him.
         
         CINNA	Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
         
         CAESAR	Are we all ready? What is now amiss
         	That Caesar and his senate must redress?
         
         METELLUS CIMBER	Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
         	Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
         	An humble heart,--
         
         	[Kneeling]
         
         CAESAR	                  I must prevent thee, Cimber.
         	These couchings and these lowly courtesies
         	Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
         	And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
         	Into the law of children. Be not fond,
         	To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
         	That will be thawed from the true quality
         	With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
         	Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
         	Thy brother by decree is banished:
         	If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
         	I spurn thee  a cur out of my way.
         	Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
         	Will he be satisfied.
         
         METELLUS CIMBER	Is there no voice more worthy than my own
         	To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
         	For the repealing of my banished brother?
         
         BRUTUS	I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
         	Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
         	Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
         
         CAESAR	What, Brutus!
         
         CASSIUS	                  Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
         	As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
         	To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
         
         CASSIUS	I could be well moved, if I were as you:
         	If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
         	But I am constant as the northern star,
         	Of whose true-fixed and resting quality
         	There is no fellow in the firmament.
         	The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks,
         	They are all fire and every one doth shine,
         	But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
         	So in the world; 'tis furnished well with men,
         	And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
         	Yet in the number I do know but one
         	That unassailable holds on his rank,
         	Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
         	Let me a little show it, even in this;
         	That I was constant Cimber should be banished,
         	And constant do remain to keep him so.
         
         CINNA	O Caesar,--
         
         CAESAR	          Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	Great Caesar,--
         
         CAESAR	                  Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
         
         CASCA	Speak, hands for me!
         
         	[CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and
         	BRUTUS stab CAESAR]
         
         CAESAR	Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
         
         	[Dies]
         
         CINNA	Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
         	Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
         
         CASSIUS	Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
         	'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'
         
         BRUTUS	People and senators, be not affrighted;
         	Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.
         
         CASCA	Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	And Cassius too.
         
         BRUTUS	Where's Publius?
         
         CINNA	Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
         
         METELLUS CIMBER	Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
         	Should chance--
         
         BRUTUS	Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
         	There is no harm intended to your person,
         	Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.
         
         CASSIUS	And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
         	Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
         
         BRUTUS	Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
         	But we the doers.
         
         	[Re-enter TREBONIUS]
         
         CASSIUS	                  Where is Antony?
         
         TREBONIUS	Fled to his house amazed:
         	Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
         	As it were doomsday.
         
         BRUTUS	Fates, we will know your pleasures:
         	That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
         	And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
         
         CASSIUS	Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
         	Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
         
         BRUTUS	Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
         	So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
         	His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
         	And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
         	Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
         	Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
         	And, waving our red weapons over our heads,
         	Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'
         
         CASSIUS	Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
         	Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
         	In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
         
         BRUTUS	How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
         	That now on Pompey's basis lies along
         	No worthier than the dust!
         
         CASSIUS	So oft as that shall be,
         	So often shall the knot of us be called
         	The men that gave their country liberty.
         
         DECIUS BRUTUS	What, shall we forth?
         
         CASSIUS	Ay, every man away:
         	Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
         	With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
         
         	[Enter a Servant]
         
         BRUTUS	Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
         
         Servant	Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:
         	Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
         	And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
         	Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
         	Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:
         	Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;
         	Say I feared Caesar, honoured him and loved him.
         	If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
         	May safely come to him, and be resolved
         	How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
         	Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
         	So well as Brutus living; but will follow
         	The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
         	Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
         	With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
         
         BRUTUS	Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
         	I never thought him worse.
         	Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
         	He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,
         	Depart untouched.
         
         Servant	                  I'll fetch him presently.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         BRUTUS	I know that we shall have him well to friend.
         
         CASSIUS	I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
         	That fears him much; and my misgiving still
         	Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
         
         BRUTUS	But here comes Antony.
         
         	[Re-enter ANTONY]
         
         		 Welcome, Mark Antony.
         
         ANTONY	O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
         	Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
         	Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
         	I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
         	Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
         	If I myself, there is no hour so fit
         	As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
         	Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
         	With the most noble blood of all this world.
         	I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
         	Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
         	Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
         	I shall not find myself so apt to die:
         	No place will please me so, no mean of death,
         	As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
         	The choice and master spirits of this age.
         
         BRUTUS	O Antony, beg not your death of us.
         	Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
         	As, by our hands and this our present act,
         	You see we do, yet see you but our hands
         	And this the bleeding business they have done:
         	Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
         	And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
         	As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
         	Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
         	To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
         	Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
         	Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
         	With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
         
         CASSIUS	Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
         	In the disposing of new dignities.
         
         BRUTUS	Only be patient till we have appeased
         	The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
         	And then we will deliver you the cause,
         	Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
         	Have thus proceeded.
         
         ANTONY	I doubt not of your wisdom.
         	Let each man render me his bloody hand:
         	First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
         	Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
         	Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
         	Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
         	Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
         	Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
         	My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
         	That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
         	Either a coward or a flatterer.
         	That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
         	If then thy spirit look upon us now,
         	Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
         	To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
         	Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
         	Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
         	Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
         	Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
         	It would become me better than to close
         	In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
         	Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart;
         	Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
         	Signed in thy spoil, and crimsoned in thy lethe.
         	O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
         	And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
         	How  a deer, strucken by many princes,
         	Dost thou here lie!
         
         CASSIUS	Mark Antony,--
         
         ANTONY	                  Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
         	The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
         	Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
         
         CASSIUS	I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
         	But what compact mean you to have with us?
         	Will you be pricked in number of our friends;
         	Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
         
         ANTONY	Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
         	Swayed from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
         	Friends am I with you all and love you all,
         	Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
         	Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
         
         BRUTUS	Or else were this a savage spectacle:
         	Our reasons are so full of good regard
         	That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
         	You should be satisfied.
         
         ANTONY	That's all I seek:
         	And am moreover suitor that I may
         	Produce his body to the market-place;
         	And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
         	Speak in the order of his funeral.
         
         BRUTUS	You shall, Mark Antony.
         
         CASSIUS	Brutus, a word with you.
         
         	[Aside to BRUTUS]
         
         	You know not what you do: do not consent
         	That Antony speak in his funeral:
         	Know you how much the people may be moved
         	By that which he will utter?
         
         BRUTUS	By your pardon;
         	I will myself into the pulpit first,
         	And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
         	What Antony shall speak, I will protest
         	He speaks by leave and by permission,
         	And that we are contented Caesar shall
         	Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
         	It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
         
         CASSIUS	I know not what may fall; I  it not.
         
         BRUTUS	Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
         	You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
         	But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
         	And say you do't by our permission;
         	Else shall you not have any hand at all
         	About his funeral: and you shall speak
         	In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
         	After my speech is ended.
         
         ANTONY	Be it so.
         	I do desire no more.
         
         BRUTUS	Prepare the body then, and follow us.
         
         	[Exeunt all but ANTONY]
         
         ANTONY	O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
         	That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
         	Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
         	That ever lived in the tide of times.
         	Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
         	Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
         	Which,  dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
         	To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
         	A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
         	Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
         	Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
         	Blood and destruction shall be so in use
         	And dreadful objects so familiar
         	That mothers shall but smile when they behold
         	Their infants quartered with the hands of war;
         	All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
         	And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
         	With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
         	Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
         	Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
         	That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
         	With carrion men, groaning for burial.
         
         	[Enter a Servant]
         
         	You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
         
         Servant	I do, Mark Antony.
         
         ANTONY	Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
         
         Servant	He did receive his letters, and is coming;
         	And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
         	O Caesar!--
         
         	[Seeing the body]
         
         ANTONY	Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
         	Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
         	Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
         	Began to water. Is thy master coming?
         
         Servant	He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.
         
         ANTONY	Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
         	Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
         	No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
         	Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
         	Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
         	Into the market-place: there shall I try
         	In my oration, how the people take
         	The cruel issue of these bloody men;
         	According to the which, thou shalt discourse
         	To young Octavius of the state of things.
         	Lend me your hand.
         
         	[Exeunt with CAESAR's body]

         SCENE 	The Forum.
         
         
         	[Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens]
         
         Citizens	We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.
         
         BRUTUS	Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
         	Cassius, go you into the other street,
         	And part the numbers.
         	Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
         	Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
         	And public reasons shall be rendered
         	Of Caesar's death.
         
         First Citizen	                  I will hear Brutus speak.
         
         Second Citizen	I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,
         	When severally we hear them rendered.
         
         	[Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS
         	goes into the pulpit]
         
         Third Citizen	The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
         
         BRUTUS	Be patient till the last.
         
         	Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
         	cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
         	for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
         	you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
         	awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
         	If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
         	Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
         	was no less than his. If then that friend demand
         	why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
         	--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
         	Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
         	die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
         	all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
         	as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
         	valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
         	slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
         	fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
         	ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
         	bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
         	Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
         	any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
         	vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
         	for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
         
         All	None, Brutus, none.
         
         BRUTUS	Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
         	Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
         	his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
         	extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
         	enforced, for which he suffered death.
         
         	[Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body]
         
         	Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
         	though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
         	the benefit of his dying, a place in the
         	commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
         	I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
         	good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
         	when it shall please my country to need my death.
         
         All	Live, Brutus! live, live!
         
         First Citizen	Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
         
         Second Citizen	Give him a statue with his ancestors.
         
         Third Citizen	Let him be Caesar.
         
         Fourth Citizen	                  Caesar's better parts
         	Shall be crowned in Brutus.
         
         First Citizen	We'll bring him to his house
         	With shouts and clamours.
         
         BRUTUS	My countrymen,--
         
         Second Citizen	Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
         
         First Citizen	Peace, ho!
         
         BRUTUS	Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
         	And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
         	Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
         	Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,
         	By our permission, is allowed to make.
         	I do entreat you, not a man depart,
         	Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         First Citizen	Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.
         
         Third Citizen	Let him go up into the public chair;
         	We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
         
         ANTONY	For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
         
         	[Goes into the pulpit]
         
         Fourth Citizen	What does he say of Brutus?
         
         Third Citizen	He says, for Brutus' sake,
         	He finds himself beholding to us all.
         
         Fourth Citizen	'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
         
         First Citizen	This Caesar was a tyrant.
         
         Third Citizen	Nay, that's certain:
         	We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
         
         Second Citizen	Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
         
         ANTONY	You gentle Romans,--
         
         Citizens	Peace, ho! let us hear him.
         
         ANTONY	Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
         	I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
         	The evil that men do lives after them;
         	The good is oft interred with their bones;
         	So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
         	Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
         	If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
         	And grievously hath Caesar answered it.
         	Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
         	For Brutus is an honourable man;
         	So are they all, all honourable men--
         	Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
         	He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
         	But Brutus says he was ambitious;
         	And Brutus is an honourable man.
         	He hath brought many captives home to Rome
         	Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
         	Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
         	When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
         	Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
         	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
         	And Brutus is an honourable man.
         	You all did see that on the Lupercal
         	I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
         	Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
         	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
         	And, sure, he is an honourable man.
         	I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
         	But here I am to speak what I do know.
         	You all did love him once, not without cause:
         	What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
         	O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
         	And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
         	My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
         	And I must pause till it come back to me.
         
         First Citizen	Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
         
         Second Citizen	If thou consider rightly of the matter,
         	Caesar has had great wrong.
         
         Third Citizen	Has he, masters?
         	I fear there will a worse come in his place.
         
         Fourth Citizen	Marked ye his words? He would not take the crown;
         	Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
         
         First Citizen	If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
         
         Second Citizen	Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
         
         Third Citizen	There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
         
         Fourth Citizen	Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
         
         ANTONY	But yesterday the word of Caesar might
         	Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
         	And none so poor to do him reverence.
         	O masters, if I were disposed to stir
         	Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
         	I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
         	Who, you all know, are honourable men:
         	I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
         	To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
         	Than I will wrong such honourable men.
         	But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
         	I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
         	Let but the commons hear this testament--
         	Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
         	And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
         	And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
         	Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
         	And, dying, mention it within their wills,
         	Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
         	Unto their issue.
         
         Fourth Citizen	We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.
         
         All	The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
         
         ANTONY	Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
         	It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
         	You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
         	And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
         	It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
         	'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
         	For, if you should, O, what would come of it!
         
         Fourth Citizen	Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
         	You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
         
         ANTONY	Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
         	I have overshot myself to tell you of it:
         	I fear I wrong the honourable men
         	Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar; I do fear it.
         
         Fourth Citizen	They were traitors: honourable men!
         
         All	The will! the testament!
         
         Second Citizen	They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.
         
         ANTONY	You will compel me, then, to read the will?
         	Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
         	And let me show you him that made the will.
         	Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
         
         Several Citizens	Come down.
         
         Second Citizen	Descend.
         
         Third Citizen	You shall have leave.
         
         	[ANTONY comes down]
         
         Fourth Citizen	A ring; stand round.
         
         First Citizen	Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
         
         Second Citizen	Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
         
         ANTONY	Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.
         
         Several Citizens	Stand back; room; bear back.
         
         ANTONY	If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
         	You all do know this mantle: I remember
         	The first time ever Caesar put it on;
         	'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
         	That day he overcame the Nerv:
         	Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
         	See what a rent the envious Casca made:
         	Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed;
         	And as he plucked his cursed steel away,
         	Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,
         	As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
         	If Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no;
         	For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
         	Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
         	This was the most unkindest cut of all;
         	For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
         	Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
         	Quite vanquished him: then burst his mighty heart;
         	And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
         	Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
         	Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
         	O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
         	Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
         	Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.
         	O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
         	The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
         	Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
         	Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
         	Here is himself, marred, as you see, with traitors.
         
         First Citizen	O piteous spectacle!
         
         Second Citizen	O noble Caesar!
         
         Third Citizen	O woful day!
         
         Fourth Citizen	O traitors, villains!
         
         First Citizen	O most bloody sight!
         
         Second Citizen	We will be revenged.
         
         All	Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
         	Let not a traitor live!
         
         ANTONY	Stay, countrymen.
         
         First Citizen	Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
         
         Second Citizen	We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
         
         ANTONY	Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
         	To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
         	They that have done this deed are honourable:
         	What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
         	That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
         	And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
         	I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
         	I am no orator, as Brutus is;
         	But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
         	That love my friend; and that they know full well
         	That gave me public leave to speak of him:
         	For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
         	Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
         	To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
         	I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
         	Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
         	And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
         	And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
         	Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
         	In every wound of Caesar that should move
         	The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
         
         All	We'll mutiny.
         
         First Citizen	We'll burn the house of Brutus.
         
         Third Citizen	Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
         
         ANTONY	Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
         
         All	Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!
         
         ANTONY	Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
         	Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
         	Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
         	You have forgot the will I told you of.
         
         All	Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
         
         ANTONY	Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
         	To every Roman citizen he gives,
         	To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
         
         Second Citizen	Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
         
         Third Citizen	O royal Caesar!
         
         ANTONY	Hear me with patience.
         
         All	Peace, ho!
         
         ANTONY	Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
         	His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
         	On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
         	And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
         	To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
         	Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
         
         First Citizen	Never, never. Come, away, away!
         	We'll burn his body in the holy place,
         	And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
         	Take up the body.
         
         Second Citizen	Go fetch fire.
         
         Third Citizen	Pluck down benches.
         
         Fourth Citizen	Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.
         
         	[Exeunt Citizens with the body]
         
         ANTONY	Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
         	Take thou what course thou wilt!
         
         	[Enter a Servant]
         
         		                  How now, fellow!
         
         Servant	Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
         
         ANTONY	Where is he?
         
         Servant	He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
         
         ANTONY	And thither will I straight to visit him:
         	He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
         	And in this mood will give us any thing.
         
         Servant	I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
         	Are rid  madmen through the gates of Rome.
         
         ANTONY	Be they had some notice of the people,
         	How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.

         SCENE I	A street.
         
         
         	[Enter CINNA the poet]
         
         CINNA THE POET	I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
         	And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
         	I have no will to wander forth of doors,
         	Yet something leads me forth.
         
         	[Enter Citizens]
         
         First Citizen	What is your name?
         
         Second Citizen	Whither are you going?
         
         Third Citizen	Where do you dwell?
         
         Fourth Citizen	Are you a married man or a bachelor?
         
         Second Citizen	Answer every man directly.
         
         First Citizen	Ay, and briefly.
         
         Fourth Citizen	Ay, and wisely.
         
         Third Citizen	Ay, and truly, you were best.
         
         CINNA THE POET	What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
         	dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
         	answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
         	truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
         
         Second Citizen	That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:
         	you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.
         
         CINNA THE POET	Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
         
         First Citizen	As a friend or an enemy?
         
         CINNA THE POET	As a friend.
         
         Second Citizen	That matter is answered directly.
         
         Fourth Citizen	For your dwelling,--briefly.
         
         CINNA THE POET	Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
         
         Third Citizen	Your name, sir, truly.
         
         CINNA THE POET	Truly, my name is Cinna.
         
         First Citizen	Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.
         
         CINNA THE POET	I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
         
         Fourth Citizen	Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
         
         CINNA THE POET	I am not Cinna the conspirator.
         
         Fourth Citizen	It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his
         	name out of his heart, and turn him going.
         
         Third Citizen	Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:
         	to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'

         	[ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table]
         
         ANTONY	These many, then, shall die; their names are pricked.
         
         OCTAVIUS	Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
         
         LEPIDUS	I do consent--
         
         OCTAVIUS	                  Prick him down, Antony.
         
         LEPIDUS	Upon condition Publius shall not live,
         	Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
         
         ANTONY	He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
         	But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
         	Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
         	How to cut off some charge in legacies.
         
         LEPIDUS	What, shall I find you here?
         
         OCTAVIUS	Or here, or at the Capitol.
         
         	[Exit LEPIDUS]
         
         ANTONY	This is a slight unmeritable man,
         	Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
         	The three-fold world divided, he should stand
         	One of the three to share it?
         
         OCTAVIUS	So you thought him;
         	And took his voice who should be pricked to die,
         	In our black sentence and proscription.
         
         ANTONY	Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
         	And though we lay these honours on this man,
         	To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
         	He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
         	To groan and sweat under the business,
         	Either led or driven, as we point the way;
         	And having brought our treasure where we will,
         	Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
         	 to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
         	And graze in commons.
         
         OCTAVIUS	You may do your will;
         	But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
         
         ANTONY	So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
         	I do appoint him store of provender:
         	It is a creature that I teach to fight,
         	To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
         	His corporal motion governed by my spirit.
         	And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
         	He must be taught and trained and bid go forth;
         	A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
         	On abjects, orts and imitations,
         	Which, out of use and staled by other men,
         	Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
         	But as a property. And now, Octavius,
         	Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
         	Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
         	Therefore let our alliance be combined,
         	Our best friends made, our means stretched
         	And let us presently go sit in council,
         	How covert matters may be best disclosed,
         	And open perils surest answered.
         
         OCTAVIUS	Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
         	And bayed about with many enemies;
         	And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
         	Millions of mischiefs.

         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE 	Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.
         
         
         	[Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and
         	Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them]
         
         BRUTUS	Stand, ho!
         
         LUCILIUS	Give the word, ho! and stand.
         
         BRUTUS	What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
         
         LUCILIUS	He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
         	To do you salutation from his master.
         
         BRUTUS	He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
         	In his own change, or by ill officers,
         	Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
         	Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
         	I shall be satisfied.
         
         PINDARUS	I do not doubt
         	But that my noble master will appear
         	Such as he is, full of regard and honour.
         
         BRUTUS	He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
         	How he received you, let me be resolved.
         
         LUCILIUS	With courtesy and with respect enough;
         	But not with such familiar instances,
         	Nor with such free and friendly conference,
         	As he hath used of old.
         
         BRUTUS	Thou hast described
         	A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
         	When love begins to sicken and decay,
         	It useth an enforced ceremony.
         	There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
         	But hollow men,  horses hot at hand,
         	Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
         	But when they should endure the bloody spur,
         	They fall their crests, and,  deceitful jades,
         	Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
         
         LUCILIUS	They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered;
         	The greater part, the horse in general,
         	Are come with Cassius.
         
         BRUTUS	Hark! he is arrived.
         
         	[Low march within]
         
         	March gently on to meet him.
         
         	[Enter CASSIUS and his powers]
         
         CASSIUS	Stand, ho!
         
         BRUTUS	Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
         
         First Soldier	Stand!
         
         Second Soldier	Stand!
         
         Third Soldier	Stand!
         
         CASSIUS	Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
         
         BRUTUS	Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
         	And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
         
         CASSIUS	Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
         	And when you do them--
         
         BRUTUS	Cassius, be content.
         	Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
         	Before the eyes of both our armies here,
         	Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
         	Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
         	Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
         	And I will give you audience.
         
         CASSIUS	Pindarus,
         	Bid our commanders lead their charges off
         	A little from this ground.
         
         BRUTUS	Lucilius, do you the ; and let no man
         	Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
         	Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
         
         	[Exeunt]
         
         
         
         
         	JULIUS CAESAR
         
         
         ACT 
         
         
         
         SCENE I	Brutus's tent.
         
         
         	[Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS]
         
         CASSIUS	That you have wronged me doth appear in this:
         	You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella
         	For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
         	Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
         	Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
         
         BRUTUS	You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
         
         CASSIUS	In such a time as this it is not meet
         	That every nice offence should bear his comment.
         
         BRUTUS	Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
         	Are much condemned to have an itching palm;
         	To sell and mart your offices for gold
         	To undeservers.
         
         CASSIUS	                  I an itching palm!
         	You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
         	Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
         
         BRUTUS	The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
         	And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
         
         CASSIUS	Chastisement!
         
         BRUTUS	Remember March, the ides of March remember:
         	Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
         	What villain touched his body, that did stab,
         	And not for justice? What, shall one of us
         	That struck the foremost man of all this world
         	But for supporting robbers, shall we now
         	Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
         	And sell the mighty space of our large honours
         	For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
         	I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
         	Than such a Roman.
         
         CASSIUS	                  Brutus, bay not me;
         	I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
         	To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
         	Older in practise, abler than yourself
         	To make conditions.
         
         BRUTUS	Go to; you are not, Cassius.
         
         CASSIUS	I am.
         
         BRUTUS	I say you are not.
         
         CASSIUS	Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
         	Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
         
         BRUTUS	Away, slight man!
         
         CASSIUS	Is't possible?
         
         BRUTUS	                  Hear me, for I will speak.
         	Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
         	Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
         
         CASSIUS	O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?
         
         BRUTUS	All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
         	Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
         	And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
         	Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
         	Under your testy humour? By the gods
         	You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
         	Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
         	I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
         	When you are waspish.
         
         CASSIUS	Is it come to this?
         
         BRUTUS	You say you are a better soldier:
         	Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
         	And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
         	I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
         
         CASSIUS	You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
         	I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
         	Did I say 'better'?
         
         BRUTUS	If you did, I care not.
         
         CASSIUS	When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
         
         BRUTUS	Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
         
         CASSIUS	I durst not!
         
         BRUTUS	No.
         
         CASSIUS	What, durst not tempt him!
         
         BRUTUS	For your life you durst not!
         
         CASSIUS	Do not presume too much upon my love;
         	I may do that I shall be sorry for.
         
         BRUTUS	You have done that you should be sorry for.
         	There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
         	For I am armed so strong in honesty
         	That they pass by me as the idle wind,
         	Which I respect not. I did send to you
         	For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
         	For I can raise no money by vile means:
         	By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
         	And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
         	From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
         	By any indirection: I did send
         	To you for gold to pay my legions,
         	Which you denied me: was that done  Cassius?
         	Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?
         	When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
         	To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
         	Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
         	Dash him to pieces!
         
         CASSIUS	I denied you not.
         
         BRUTUS	You did.
         
         CASSIUS	I did not: he was but a fool that brought
         	My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
         	A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
         	But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
         
         BRUTUS	I do not, till you practise them on me.
         
         CASSIUS	You love me not.
         
         BRUTUS	                  I do not  your faults.
         
         CASSIUS	A friendly eye could never see such faults.
         
         BRUTUS	A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
         	As huge as high Olympus.
         
         CASSIUS	Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
         	Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
         	For Cassius is aweary of the world;
         	Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
         	Chequeed  a bondman; all his faults observed,
         	Set in a note-book, learned, and conned by rote,
         	To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
         	My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
         	And here my naked breast; within, a heart
         	Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
         	If that thou beest a Roman, take it forth;
         	I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
         	Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
         	When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
         	Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
         
         BRUTUS	Sheathe your dagger:
         	Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
         	Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
         	O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
         	That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
         	Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
         	And straight is cold again.
         
         CASSIUS	Hath Cassius lived
         	To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
         	When grief, and blood ill-tempered, vexeth him?
         
         BRUTUS	When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.
         
         CASSIUS	Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
         
         BRUTUS	And my heart too.
         
         CASSIUS	                  O Brutus!
         
         BRUTUS	What's the matter?
         
         CASSIUS	Have not you love enough to bear with me,
         	When that rash humour which my mother gave me
         	Makes me forgetful?
         
         BRUTUS	Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
         	When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
         	He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
         
         Poet	[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals;
         	There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
         	They be alone.
         
         LUCILIUS	[Within]  You shall not come to them.
         
         Poet	[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.
         
         	[Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS]
         
         CASSIUS	How now! what's the matter?
         
         Poet	For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
         	Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
         	For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
         
         CASSIUS	Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
         
         BRUTUS	Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
         
         CASSIUS	Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
         
         BRUTUS	I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
         	What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
         	Companion, hence!
         
         CASSIUS	                  Away, away, be gone.
         
         	[Exit Poet]
         
         BRUTUS	Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
         	Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
         
         CASSIUS	And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
         	Immediately to us.
         
         	[Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS]
         
         BRUTUS	Lucius, a bowl of wine!
         
         	[Exit LUCIUS]
         
         CASSIUS	I did not think you could have been so angry.
         
         BRUTUS	O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
         
         CASSIUS	Of your philosophy you make no use,
         	If you give place to accidental evils.
         
         BRUTUS	No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
         
         CASSIUS	Ha! Portia!
         
         BRUTUS	She is dead.
         
         CASSIUS	How 'scaped I killing when I crossed you so?
         	O insupportable and touching loss!
         	Upon what sickness?
         
         BRUTUS	Impatient of my absence,
         	And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
         	Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
         	That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
         	And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire.
         
         CASSIUS	And died so?
         
         BRUTUS	                  Even so.
         
         CASSIUS	O ye immortal gods!
         
         	[Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper]
         
         BRUTUS	Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
         	In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
         
         CASSIUS	My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
         	Fill, Lucius, till the wine overswell the cup;
         	I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
         
         BRUTUS	Come in, Titinius!
         
         	[Exit LUCIUS]
         
         	[Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA]
         
         	Welcome, good Messala.
         	Now sit we close about this taper here,
         	And call in question our necessities.
         
         CASSIUS	Portia, art thou gone?
         
         BRUTUS	No more, I pray you.
         	Messala, I have here received letters,
         	That young Octavius and Mark Antony
         	Come down upon us with a mighty power,
         	Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
         
         MESSALA	Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
         
         BRUTUS	With what addition?
         
         MESSALA	That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
         	Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
         	Have put to death an hundred senators.
         
         BRUTUS	Therein our letters do not well agree;
         	Mine speak of seventy senators that died
         	By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
         
         CASSIUS	Cicero one!
         
         MESSALA	          Cicero is dead,
         	And by that order of proscription.
         	Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
         
         BRUTUS	No, Messala.
         
         MESSALA	Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
         
         BRUTUS	Nothing, Messala.
         
         MESSALA	                  That, methinks, is strange.
         
         BRUTUS	Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
         
         MESSALA	No, my lord.
         
         BRUTUS	Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
         
         MESSALA	Then  a Roman bear the truth I tell:
         	For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
         
         BRUTUS	Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
         	With meditating that she must die once,
         	I have the patience to endure it now.
         
         MESSALA	Even so great men great losses should endure.
         
         CASSIUS	I have as much of this in art as you,
         	But yet my nature could not bear it so.
         
         BRUTUS	Well, to our work alive. What do you think
         	Of marching to Philippi presently?
         
         CASSIUS	I do not think it good.
         
         BRUTUS	Your reason?
         
         CASSIUS	This it is:
         	'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
         	So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
         	Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
         	Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
         
         BRUTUS	Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
         	The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
         	Do stand but in a forced affection;
         	For they have grudged us contribution:
         	The enemy, marching along by them,
         	By them shall make a fuller number up,
         	Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged;
         	From which advantage shall we cut him off,
         	If at Philippi we do face him there,
         	These people at our back.
         
         CASSIUS	Hear me, good brother.
         
         BRUTUS	Under your pardon. You must note beside,
         	That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
         	Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
         	The enemy increaseth every day;
         	We, at the height, are ready to decline.
         	There is a tide in the affairs of men,
         	Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
         	Omitted, all the voyage of their life
         	Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
         	On such a full sea are we now afloat;
         	And we must take the current when it serves,
         	Or lose our ventures.
         
         CASSIUS	Then, with your will, go on;
         	We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
         
         BRUTUS	The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
         	And nature must obey necessity;
         	Which we will niggard with a little rest.
         	There is no more to say?
         
         CASSIUS	No more. Good night:
         	Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
         
         BRUTUS	Lucius!
         
         	[Enter LUCIUS]
         	My gown.
         
         	[Exit LUCIUS]
         
         	Farewell, good Messala:
         	Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
         	Good night, and good repose.
         
         CASSIUS	O my dear brother!
         	This was an ill beginning of the night:
         	Never come such division 'tween our souls!
         	Let it not, Brutus.
         
         BRUTUS	Every thing is well.
         
         CASSIUS	Good night, my lord.
         
         BRUTUS	Good night, good brother.
         
         
         TITINIUS	|
         	| Good night, Lord Brutus.

         BRUTUS	Farewell, every one.
         
         	[Exeunt all but BRUTUS]
         
         	[Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown]
         
         	Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
         
         LUCIUS	Here in the tent.
         
         BRUTUS	                  What, thou speakest drowsily?
         	Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art over-watched.
         	Call Claudius and some other of my men:
         	I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
         
         LUCIUS	Varro and Claudius!
         
         	[Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS]
         
         VARRO	Calls my lord?
         
         BRUTUS	I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
         	It may be I shall raise you by and by
         	On business to my brother Cassius.
         
         VARRO	So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
         
         BRUTUS	I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
         	It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
         	Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
         	I put it in the pocket of my gown.
         
         	[VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down]
         
         LUCIUS	I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
         
         BRUTUS	Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
         	Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
         	And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
         
         LUCIUS	Ay, my lord, an't please you.
         
         BRUTUS	It does, my boy:
         	I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
         
         LUCIUS	It is my duty, sir.
         
         BRUTUS	I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
         	I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
         
         LUCIUS	I have slept, my lord, already.
         
         BRUTUS	It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
         	I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
         	I will be good to thee.
         
         	[Music, and a song]
         
         	This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
         	Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
         	That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
         	I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
         	If thou dost nod, thou breakest thy instrument;
         	I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
         	Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turned down
         	Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
         
         	[Enter the Ghost of CAESAR]
         
         	How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
         	I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
         	That shapes this monstrous apparition.
         	It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
         	Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
         	That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
         	Speak to me what thou art.
         
         GHOST	Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
         
         BRUTUS	Why comest thou?
         
         GHOST	To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
         
         BRUTUS	Well; then I shall see thee again?
         
         GHOST	Ay, at Philippi.
         
         BRUTUS	Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
         
         	[Exit Ghost]
         
         	Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
         	Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
         	Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!
         
         LUCIUS	The strings, my lord, are false.
         
         BRUTUS	He thinks he still is at his instrument.
         	Lucius, awake!
         
         LUCIUS	My lord?
         
         BRUTUS	Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
         
         LUCIUS	My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
         
         BRUTUS	Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
         
         LUCIUS	Nothing, my lord.
         
         BRUTUS	Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!
         
         	[To VARRO]
         
         	Fellow thou, awake!
         
         VARRO	My lord?
         
         CLAUDIUS	My lord?
         
         BRUTUS	Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
         
         
         VARRO	|
         	|  Did we, my lord?
         CLAUDIUS	|
         
         
         BRUTUS	Ay: saw you any thing?
         
         VARRO	No, my lord, I saw nothing.
         
         CLAUDIUS	Nor I, my lord.
         
         BRUTUS	Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
         	Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
         	And we will follow.
         
         
         VARRO	|
         	|                It shall be done, my lord.

         SCENE I	The plains of Philippi.
         
         
         	[Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army]
         
         OCTAVIUS	Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:
         	You said the enemy would not come down,
         	But keep the hills and upper regions;
         	It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
         	They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
         	Answering before we do demand of them.
         
         ANTONY	Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
         	Wherefore they do it: they could be content
         	To visit other places; and come down
         	With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
         	To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
         	But 'tis not so.
         
         	[Enter a Messenger]
         
         Messenger	                  Prepare you, generals:
         	The enemy comes on in gallant show;
         	Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
         	And something to be done immediately.
         
         ANTONY	Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
         	Upon the left hand of the even field.
         
         OCTAVIUS	Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
         
         ANTONY	Why do you cross me in this exigent?
         
         OCTAVIUS	I do not cross you; but I will do so.
         
         	[March]
         
         	[Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army;
         	LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others]
         
         BRUTUS	They stand, and would have parley.
         
         CASSIUS	Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.
         
         OCTAVIUS	Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
         
         ANTONY	No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
         	Make forth; the generals would have some words.
         
         OCTAVIUS	Stir not until the signal.
         
         BRUTUS	Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?
         
         OCTAVIUS	Not that we love words better, as you do.
         
         BRUTUS	Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
         
         ANTONY	In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
         	Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
         	Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'
         
         CASSIUS	Antony,
         	The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
         	But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
         	And leave them honeyless.
         
         ANTONY	Not stingless too.
         
         BRUTUS	O, yes, and soundless too;
         	For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
         	And very wisely threat before you sting.
         
         ANTONY	Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
         	Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar:
         	You showed your teeth  apes, and fawned  hounds,
         	And bowed  bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
         	Whilst damned Casca,  a cur, behind
         	Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
         
         CASSIUS	Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
         	This tongue had not offended so to-day,
         	If Cassius might have ruled.
         
         OCTAVIUS	Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,
         	The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;
         	I draw a sword against conspirators;
         	When think you that the sword goes up again?
         	Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
         	Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
         	Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
         
         BRUTUS	Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
         	Unless thou bringest them with thee.
         
         OCTAVIUS	So I hope;
         	I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
         
         BRUTUS	O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
         	Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.
         
         CASSIUS	A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
         	Joined with a masker and a reveller!
         
         ANTONY	Old Cassius still!
         
         OCTAVIUS	                  Come, Antony, away!
         	Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
         	If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
         	If not, when you have stomachs.
         
         	[Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army]
         
         CASSIUS	Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
         	The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
         
         BRUTUS	Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.
         
         LUCILIUS	[Standing forth]	My lord?
         
         	[BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart]
         
         CASSIUS	Messala!
         
         MESSALA	[Standing forth]  What says my general?
         
         CASSIUS	Messala,
         	This is my birth-day; as this very day
         	Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
         	Be thou my witness that against my will,
         	As Pompey was, am I compelled to set
         	Upon one battle all our liberties.
         	You know that I held Epicurus strong
         	And his opinion: now I change my mind,
         	And partly credit things that do presage.
         	Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
         	Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched,
         	Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
         	Who to Philippi here consorted us:
         	This morning are they fled away and gone;
         	And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
         	Fly over our heads and downward look on us,
         	As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
         	A canopy most fatal, under which
         	Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
         
         MESSALA	Believe not so.
         
         CASSIUS	                  I but believe it partly;
         	For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
         	To meet all perils very constantly.
         
         BRUTUS	Even so, Lucilius.
         
         CASSIUS	                  Now, most noble Brutus,
         	The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
         	Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
         	But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
         	Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
         	If we do lose this battle, then is this
         	The very last time we shall speak together:
         	What are you then determined to do?
         
         BRUTUS	Even by the rule of that philosophy
         	By which I did blame Cato for the death
         	Which he did give himself, I know not how,
         	But I do find it cowardly and vile,
         	For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
         	The time of life: arming myself with patience
         	To stay the providence of some high powers
         	That govern us below.
         
         CASSIUS	Then, if we lose this battle,
         	You are contented to be led in triumph
         	Thorough the streets of Rome?
         
         BRUTUS	No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
         	That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
         	He bears too great a mind. But this same day
         	Must end that work the ides of March begun;
         	And whether we shall meet again I know not.
         	Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
         	For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
         	If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
         	If not, why then, this parting was well made.
         
         CASSIUS	For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
         	If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
         	If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
         
         BRUTUS	Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
         	The end of this day's business ere it come!
         	But it sufficeth that the day will end,
         	And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!
         
         	[Exeunt]

         	[Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA]
         
         BRUTUS	Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills

         	[Loud alarum]

         	[Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS]
         
         CASSIUS	O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
         	Myself have to mine own turned enemy:
         	This ensign here of mine was turning back;
         	I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
         
         TITINIUS	O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
         	Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
         	Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
         	Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
         
         	[Enter PINDARUS]
         
         PINDARUS	Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
         	Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
         	Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
         
         CASSIUS	This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
         	Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
         
         TITINIUS	They are, my lord.
         
         CASSIUS	                  Titinius, if thou lovest me,
         	Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
         	Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
         	And here again; that I may rest assured
         	Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
         
         TITINIUS	I will be here again, even with a thought.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         CASSIUS	Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
         	My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
         	And tell me what thou notest about the field.
         
         	[PINDARUS ascends the hill]
         
         	This day I breathed first: time is come round,
         	And where I did begin, there shall I end;
         	My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?
         
         PINDARUS	[Above]  O my lord!
         
         CASSIUS	What news?
         
         PINDARUS	[Above]  Titinius is enclosed round about
         	With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
         	Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
         	Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
         	He's ta'en.
         
         	[Shout]
         
         	And, hark! they shout for joy.
         
         CASSIUS	Come down, behold no more.
         	O, coward that I am, to live so long,
         	To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
         
         	[PINDARUS descends]
         
         	Come hither, sirrah:
         	In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
         	And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
         	That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
         	Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
         	Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
         	That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
         	Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
         	And, when my face is covered, as 'tis now,
         	Guide thou the sword.
         
         	[PINDARUS stabs him]
         
         		Caesar, thou art revenged,
         	Even with the sword that killed thee.
         
         	[Dies]
         
         PINDARUS	So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
         	Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
         	Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
         	Where never Roman shall take note of him.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         	[Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA]
         
         MESSALA	It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
         	Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
         	As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
         
         TITINIUS	These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
         
         MESSALA	Where did you leave him?
         
         TITINIUS	All disconsolate,
         	With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
         
         MESSALA	Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
         
         TITINIUS	He lies not  the living. O my heart!
         
         MESSALA	Is not that he?
         
         TITINIUS	                  No, this was he, Messala,
         	But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
         	As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
         	So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
         	The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
         	Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
         	Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
         
         MESSALA	Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
         	O hateful error, melancholy's child,
         	Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
         	The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
         	Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
         	But killest the mother that engendered thee!
         
         TITINIUS	What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?
         
         MESSALA	Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
         	The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
         	Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
         	For piercing steel and darts envenomed
         	Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
         	As tidings of this sight.
         
         TITINIUS	Hie you, Messala,
         	And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
         
         	[Exit MESSALA]
         
         	Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
         	Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
         	Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
         	And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
         	Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
         	But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
         	Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
         	Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
         	And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
         	By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part
         	Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
         
         	[Kills himself]
         
         	[Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO,

         BRUTUS	Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
         
         MESSALA	Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
         
         BRUTUS	Titinius' face is upward.
         
         CATO	He is slain.
         
         BRUTUS	O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
         	Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
         	In our own proper entrails.
         
         	[Low alarums]
         
         CATO	Brave Titinius!
         	Look, whether he have not crowned dead Cassius!
         
         BRUTUS	Are yet two Romans living such as these?
         	The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
         	It is impossible that ever Rome
         	Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
         	To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
         	I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
         	Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
         	His funerals shall not be in our camp,
         	Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
         	And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
         	Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
         	'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
         	We shall try fortune in a second fight.

         	I will proclaim my name about the field:

         LUCILIUS	Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
         	I dare assure thee that no enemy
         	Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
         	The gods defend him from so great a shame!
         	When you do find him, or alive or dead,
         	He will be found  Brutus,  himself.
         
         ANTONY	This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
         	A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
         	Give him all kindness: I had rather have
         	Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,

         VOLUMNIUS	What says my lord?
         
         BRUTUS	                  Why, this, Volumnius:
         	The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me
         	Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
         	And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
         	I know my hour is come.
         
         VOLUMNIUS	Not so, my lord.
         
         BRUTUS	Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
         	Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
         	Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
         
         	[Low alarums]
         
         	It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
         	Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
         	Thou knowest that we two went to school together:
         	Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
         	Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
         
         VOLUMNIUS	That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
         
         	[Alarum still]
         
         CLITUS	Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.
         
         BRUTUS	Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
         	Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
         	Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
         	My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
         	I found no man but he was true to me.
         	I shall have glory by this losing day
         	More than Octavius and Mark Antony
         	By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
         	So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
         	Hath almost ended his life's history:
         	Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
         	That have but laboured to attain this hour.
         
         	[Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!']

         	Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
         	Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
         	Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
         	While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
         
         STRATO	Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
         
         BRUTUS	Farewell, good Strato.
         
         	[Runs on his sword]

         MESSALA	My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
         
         STRATO	Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
         	The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
         	For Brutus only overcame himself,
         	And no man else hath honour by his death.
         
         LUCILIUS	So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
         	That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
         
         OCTAVIUS	All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
         	Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
         
         STRATO	Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
         
         OCTAVIUS	Do so, good Messala.
         
         MESSALA	How died my master, Strato?
         
         STRATO	I held the sword, and he did run on it.
         
         MESSALA	Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
         	That did the latest service to my master.
         
         ANTONY	This was the noblest Roman of them all:
         	All the conspirators save only he
         	Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
         	He only, in a general honest thought
         	And common good to all, made one of them.
         	His life was gentle, and the elements
         	So mixed in him that Nature might stand up
         	And say to all the world 'This was a man!'
         
         OCTAVIUS	According to his virtue let us use him,
         	With all respect and rites of burial.
         	Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
         	Most  a soldier, ordered honourably.
         	So call the field to rest; and let's away,
         	To part the glories of this happy day.

         	[Enter Chorus]
         
         Chorus	O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
         	The brightest heaven of invention,
         	A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
         	And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
         	Then should the war Harry,  himself,
         	Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
         	Leashed in  hounds, should famine, sword and fire
         	Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,
         	The flat unraised spirits that have dared
         	On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
         	So great an object: can this cockpit hold
         	The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
         	Within this wooden O the very casques
         	That did affright the air at Agincourt?
         	O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
         	Attest in little place a million;
         	And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
         	On your imaginary forces work.
         	Suppose within the girdle of these walls
         	Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
         	Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
         	The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
         	Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
         	Into a thousand parts divide on man,
         	And make imaginary puissance;
         	Think when we talk of horses, that you see them
         	Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
         	For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
         	Carry them here and there; jumping over times,
         	Turning the accomplishment of many years
         	Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
         	Admit me Chorus to this history;
         	Who prologue- your humble patience pray,
         	Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

         	KING HENRY V
         
         
         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE I	London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.
         
         
         	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY]
         
         CANTERBURY	My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
         	Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
         	Was , and had indeed against us passed,
         	But that the scambling and unquiet time
         	Did push it out of farther question.
         
         ELY	But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
         
         CANTERBURY	It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
         	We lose the better half of our possession:
         	For all the temporal lands which men devout
         	By testament have given to the church
         	Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
         	As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
         	Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
         	Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
         	And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
         	Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
         	A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
         	And to the coffers of the king beside,
         	A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.
         
         ELY	This would drink deep.
         
         CANTERBURY	'Twould drink the cup and all.
         
         ELY	But what prevention?
         
         CANTERBURY	The king is full of grace and fair regard.
         
         ELY	And a true lover of the holy church.
         
         CANTERBURY	The courses of his youth promised it not.
         	The breath no sooner left his father's body,
         	But that his wildness, mortified in him,
         	Seemed to die too; yea, at that very moment
         	Consideration,  an angel, came
         	And whipped the offending Adam out of him,
         	Leaving his body as a paradise,
         	To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
         	Never was such a sudden scholar made;
         	Never came reformation in a flood,
         	With such a heady currance, scouring faults
         	Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
         	So soon did lose his seat and all at once
         	As in this king.
         
         ELY	                  We are blessed in the change.
         
         CANTERBURY	Hear him but reason in divinity,
         	And all-admiring with an inward wish
         	You would desire the king were made a prelate:
         	Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
         	You would say it hath been all in all his study:
         	List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
         	A fearful battle rendered you in music:
         	Turn him to any cause of policy,
         	The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
         	Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
         	The air, a chartered libertine, is still,
         	And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
         	To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;
         	So that the art and practic part of life
         	Must be the mistress to this theoric:
         	Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
         	Since his addiction was to courses vain,
         	His companies unlettered, rude and shallow,
         	His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports,
         	And never noted in him any study,
         	Any retirement, any sequestration
         	From open haunts and popularity.
         
         ELY	The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
         	And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
         	Neighboured by fruit of baser quality:
         	And so the prince obscured his contemplation
         	Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
         	Grew  the summer grass, fastest by night,
         	Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.
         
         CANTERBURY	It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
         	And therefore we must needs admit the means
         	How things are perfected.
         
         ELY	But, my good lord,
         	How now for mitigation of this bill
         	Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
         	Incline to it, or no?
         
         CANTERBURY	He seems indifferent,
         	Or rather swaying more upon our part
         	Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
         	For I have made an offer to his majesty,
         	Upon our spiritual convocation
         	And in regard of causes now in hand,
         	Which I have opened to his grace at large,
         	As touching France, to give a greater sum
         	Than ever at one time the clergy yet
         	Did to his predecessors part withal.
         
         ELY	How did this offer seem received, my lord?
         
         CANTERBURY	With good acceptance of his majesty;
         	Save that there was not time enough to hear,
         	As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
         	The severals and unhidden passages
         	Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
         	And generally to the crown and seat of France
         	Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
         
         ELY	What was the impediment that broke this off?
         
         CANTERBURY	The French ambassador upon that instant
         	Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
         	To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?
         
         ELY	It is.
         
         CANTERBURY	Then go we in, to know his embassy;
         	Which I could with a ready guess declare,
         	Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
         
         ELY	I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

         SCENE 	The same. The Presence chamber.

         	WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants]
         
         KING HENRY V	Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
         
         EXETER	Not here in presence.
         
         KING HENRY V	Send for him, good uncle.
         
         WESTMORELAND	Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
         
         KING HENRY V	Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,
         	Before we hear him, of some things of weight
         	That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.
         
         	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY]
         
         CANTERBURY	God and his angels guard your sacred throne
         	And make you long become it!
         
         KING HENRY V	Sure, we thank you.
         	My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
         	And justly and religiously unfold
         	Why the law Salique that they have in France
         	Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
         	And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
         	That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
         	Or nicely charge your understanding soul
         	With opening titles miscreate, whose right
         	Suits not in native colours with the truth;
         	For God doth know how many now in health
         	Shall drop their blood in approbation
         	Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
         	Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
         	How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
         	We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
         	For never two such kingdoms did contend
         	Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
         	Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
         	'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
         	That make such waste in brief mortality.
         	Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
         	For we will hear, note and believe in heart
         	That what you speak is in your conscience washed
         	As pure as sin with baptism.
         
         CANTERBURY	Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
         	That owe yourselves, your lives and services
         	To this imperial throne. There is no bar
         	To make against your highness' claim to France
         	But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
         	'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
         	'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
         	Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
         	To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
         	The founder of this law and female bar.
         	Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
         	That the land Salique is in Germany,
         	Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
         	Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
         	There left behind and settled certain French;
         	Who, holding in disdain the German women
         	For some dishonest manners of their life,
         	Established then this law; to wit, no female
         	Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
         	Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
         	Is at this day in Germany called Meisen.
         	Then doth it well appear that Salique law
         	Was not devised for the realm of France:
         	Nor did the French possess the Salique land
         	Until four hundred one and twenty years
         	After defunction of King Pharamond,
         	Idly supposed the founder of this law;
         	Who died within the year of our redemption
         	Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
         	Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
         	Beyond the river Sala, in the year
         	Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
         	King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
         	Did, as heir general, being descended
         	Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
         	Make claim and title to the crown of France.
         	Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
         	Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
         	Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
         	To find his title with some shows of truth,
         	'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
         	Conveyed himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
         	Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
         	To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
         	Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
         	Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
         	Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
         	Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
         	That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
         	Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
         	Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
         	By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
         	Was re-united to the crown of France.
         	So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.
         	King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
         	King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
         	To hold in right and title of the female:
         	So do the kings of France unto this day;
         	Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
         	To bar your highness claiming from the female,
         	And rather choose to hide them in a net
         	Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
         	Usurped from you and your progenitors.
         
         KING HENRY V	May I with right and conscience make this claim?
         
         CANTERBURY	The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
         	For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
         	When the man dies, let the inheritance
         	Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
         	Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
         	Look back into your mighty ancestors:
         	Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
         	From whom you claim; invoke his war spirit,
         	And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
         	Who on the French ground played a tragedy,
         	Making defeat on the full power of France,
         	Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
         	Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
         	Forage in blood of French nobility.
         	O noble English. that could entertain
         	With half their forces the full Pride of France
         	And let another half stand laughing by,
         	All out of work and cold for action!
         
         ELY	Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
         	And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
         	You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
         	The blood and courage that renowned them
         	Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
         	Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
         	Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
         
         EXETER	Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
         	Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
         	As did the former lions of your blood.
         
         WESTMORELAND	They know your grace hath cause and means and might;
         	So hath your highness; never king of England
         	Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
         	Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
         	And lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
         
         CANTERBURY	O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
         	With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
         	In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
         	Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
         	As never did the clergy at one time
         	Bring in to any of your ancestors.
         
         KING HENRY V	We must not only arm to invade the French,
         	But lay down our proportions to defend
         	Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
         	With all advantages.
         
         CANTERBURY	They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
         	Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
         	Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
         
         KING HENRY V	We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
         	But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
         	Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
         	For you shall read that my great-grandfather
         	Never went with his forces into France
         	But that the Scot on his unfurnished kingdom
         	Came pouring,  the tide into a breach,
         	With ample and brim fulness of his force,
         	Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
         	Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
         	That England, being empty of defence,
         	Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.
         
         CANTERBURY	She hath been then more feared than harmed, my liege;
         	For hear her but exampled by herself:
         	When all her chivalry hath been in France
         	And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
         	She hath herself not only well defended
         	But taken and impounded as a stray
         	The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
         	To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
         	And make her chronicle as rich with praise
         	As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
         	With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.
         
         WESTMORELAND	But there's a saying very old and true,
         	'If that you will France win,
         	Then with Scotland first begin:'
         	For once the eagle England being in prey,
         	To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
         	Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
         	Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
         	To tear and havoc more than she can eat.
         
         EXETER	It follows then the cat must stay at home:
         	Yet that is but a crushed necessity,
         	Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
         	And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
         	While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
         	The advised head defends itself at home;
         	For government, though high and low and lower,
         	Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
         	Congreeing in a full and natural close,
         	 music.
         
         CANTERBURY	          Therefore doth heaven divide
         	The state of man in divers functions,
         	Setting endeavour in continual motion;
         	To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
         	Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
         	Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
         	The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
         	They have a king and officers of sorts;
         	Where some,  magistrates, correct at home,
         	Others,  merchants, venture trade abroad,
         	Others,  soldiers, armed in their stings,
         	Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
         	Which pillage they with merry march bring home
         	To the tent-royal of their emperor;
         	Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
         	The singing masons building roofs of gold,
         	The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
         	The poor mechanic porters crowding in
         	Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
         	The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
         	Delivering over to executors pale
         	The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
         	That many things, having full reference
         	To one consent, may work contrariously:
         	As many arrows, loosed several ways,
         	Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
         	As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
         	As many lines close in the dial's centre;
         	So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
         	End in one purpose, and be all well borne
         	Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
         	Divide your happy England into four;
         	Whereof take you one quarter into France,
         	And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
         	If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
         	Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
         	Let us be worried and our nation lose
         	The name of hardiness and policy.
         
         KING HENRY V	Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
         
         	[Exeunt some Attendants]
         
         	Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,
         	And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
         	France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
         	Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,
         	Ruling in large and ample empery
         	Over France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
         	Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
         	Tombless, with no remembrance over them:
         	Either our history shall with full mouth
         	Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
         	 Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,
         	Not worshipped with a waxen epitaph.
         
         	[Enter Ambassadors of France]
         
         	Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
         	Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
         	Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
         
         First Ambassador	May't please your majesty to give us leave
         	Freely to render what we have in charge;
         	Or shall we sparingly show you far off
         	The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
         
         KING HENRY V	We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
         	Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
         	As are our wretches fettered in our prisons:
         	Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
         	Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
         
         First Ambassador	Thus, then, in few.
         	Your highness, lately sending into France,
         	Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
         	Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
         	In answer of which claim, the prince our master
         	Says that you savour too much of your youth,
         	And bids you be advised there's nought in France
         	That can be with a nimble galliard won;
         	You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
         	He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
         	This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
         	Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
         	Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
         
         KING HENRY V	What treasure, uncle?
         
         EXETER	Tennis-balls, my liege.
         
         KING HENRY V	We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
         	His present and your pains we thank you for:
         	When we have marched our rackets to these balls,
         	We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
         	Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
         	Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
         	That all the courts of France will be disturbed
         	With chaces. And we understand him well,
         	How he comes over us with our wilder days,
         	Not measuring what use we made of them.
         	We never valued this poor seat of England;
         	And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
         	To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common
         	That men are merriest when they are from home.
         	But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
         	Be  a king and show my sail of greatness
         	When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
         	For that I have laid by my majesty
         	And plodded  a man for working-days,
         	But I will rise there with so full a glory
         	That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
         	Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
         	And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
         	Hath turned his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
         	Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
         	That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
         	Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
         	Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
         	And some are yet ungotten and unborn
         	That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
         	But this lies all within the will of God,
         	To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
         	Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
         	To venge me as I may and to put forth
         	My rightful hand in a well-hallowed cause.
         	So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
         	His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
         	When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
         	Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
         
         	[Exeunt Ambassadors]
         
         EXETER	This was a merry message.
         
         KING HENRY V	We hope to make the sender blush at it.
         	Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
         	That may give furtherance to our expedition;
         	For we have now no thought in us but France,
         	Save those to God, that run before our business.
         	Therefore let our proportions for these wars
         	Be soon collected and all things thought upon
         	That may with reasonable swiftness add
         	More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
         	We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
         	Therefore let every man now task his thought,
         	That this fair action may on foot be brought.

         	PROLOGUE
         
         
         	[Enter Chorus]
         
         Chorus	Now all the youth of England are on fire,
         	And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:
         	Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought
         	Reigns solely in the breast of every man:
         	They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
         	Following the mirror of all Christian kings,
         	With winged heels, as English Mercuries.
         	For now sits Expectation in the air,
         	And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
         	With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,
         	Promised to Harry and his followers.
         	The French, advised by good intelligence
         	Of this most dreadful preparation,
         	Shake in their fear and with pale policy
         	Seek to divert the English purposes.
         	O England! model to thy inward greatness,
         	 little body with a mighty heart,
         	What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
         	Were all thy children kind and natural!
         	But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
         	A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
         	With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,
         	One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
         	Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
         	Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
         	Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!
         	Confirmed conspiracy with fearful France;
         	And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
         	If hell and treason hold their promises,
         	Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.
         	Linger your patience on; and we'll digest
         	The abuse of distance; force a play:
         	The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;
         	The king is set from London; and the scene
         	Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;
         	There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:
         	And thence to France shall we convey you safe,
         	And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
         	To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
         	We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
         	But, till the king come forth, and not till then,
         	Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

         	[Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH]
         
         BARDOLPH	Well met, Corporal Nym.
         
         NYM	Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
         
         BARDOLPH	What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
         
         NYM	For my part, I care not: I say little; but when
         	time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that
         	shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will
         	wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but
         	what though? it will toast cheese, and it will
         	endure cold as another man's sword will: and
         	there's an end.
         
         BARDOLPH	I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and
         	we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it
         	be so, good Corporal Nym.
         
         NYM	Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the
         	certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I
         	will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the
         	rendezvous of it.
         
         BARDOLPH	It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell
         	Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you
         	were troth-plight to her.
         
         NYM	I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may
         	sleep, and they may have their throats about them at
         	that time; and some say knives have edges. It must
         	be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet
         	she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I
         	cannot tell.
         
         	[Enter PISTOL and Hostess]
         
         BARDOLPH	Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good
         	corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!
         
         PISTOL	Base tike, callest thou me host? Now, by this hand,
         	I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.
         
         Hostess	No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and
         	board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live
         	honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will
         	be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.
         
         	[NYM and PISTOL draw]
         
         	O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we
         	shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.
         
         BARDOLPH	Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.
         
         NYM	Pish!
         
         PISTOL	Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-eared cur of Iceland!
         
         Hostess	Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.
         
         NYM	Will you shog off? I would have you solus.
         
         PISTOL	'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!
         	The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;
         	The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,
         	And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,
         	And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
         	I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;
         	For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,
         	And flashing fire will follow.
         
         NYM	I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an
         	humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow
         	foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my
         	rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk
         	off, I would prick your guts a little, in good
         	terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.
         
         PISTOL	O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
         	The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;
         	Therefore exhale.
         
         BARDOLPH	Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the
         	first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.
         
         	[Draws]
         
         PISTOL	An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.
         	Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:
         	Thy spirits are most tall.
         
         NYM	I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair
         	terms: that is the humour of it.
         
         PISTOL	'Couple a gorge!'
         	That is the word. I thee defy again.
         	O hound of Crete, thinkest thou my spouse to get?
         	No; to the spital go,
         	And from the powdering tub of infamy
         	Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,
         	Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
         	I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly
         	For the only she; and--pauca, there's enough. Go to.
         
         	[Enter the Boy]
         
         Boy	Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and
         	you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.
         	Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and
         	do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.
         
         BARDOLPH	Away, you rogue!
         
         Hostess	By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of
         	these days. The king has killed his heart. Good
         	husband, come home presently.
         
         	[Exeunt Hostess and Boy]
         
         BARDOLPH	Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to
         	France together: why the devil should we keep
         	knives to cut one another's throats?
         
         PISTOL	Let floods overswell, and fiends for food howl on!
         
         NYM	You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?
         
         PISTOL	Base is the slave that pays.
         
         NYM	That now I will have: that's the humour of it.
         
         PISTOL	As manhood shall compound: push home.
         
         	[They draw]
         
         BARDOLPH	By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll

         PISTOL	Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.
         
         BARDOLPH	Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends:
         	an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.
         	Prithee, put up.
         
         NYM	I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?
         
         PISTOL	A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;
         	And liquor wise will I give to thee,
         	And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood:
         	I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me;
         	Is not this just? for I shall sutler be
         	Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.
         	Give me thy hand.
         
         NYM	I shall have my noble?
         
         PISTOL	In cash most justly paid.
         
         NYM	Well, then, that's the humour of't.

         Hostess	As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir
         	John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning
         	quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to
         	behold. Sweet men, come to him.
         
         NYM	The king hath run bad humours on the knight; that's
         	the even of it.
         
         PISTOL	Nym, thou hast spoke the right;
         	His heart is fracted and corroborate.
         
         NYM	The king is a good king: but it must be as it may;
         	he passes some humours and careers.
         
         PISTOL	Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins we will live.

         BEDFORD	'Fore God, his grace is bold, to trust these traitors.
         
         EXETER	They shall be apprehended by and by.
         
         WESTMORELAND	How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
         	As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
         	Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.
         
         BEDFORD	The king hath note of all that they intend,
         	By interception which they dream not of.
         
         EXETER	Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
         	Whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favours,
         	That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
         	His sovereign's life to death and treachery.
         
         	[Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY V, SCROOP,
         	CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and Attendants]
         
         KING HENRY V	Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
         	My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
         	And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:
         	Think you not that the powers we bear with us
         	Will cut their passage through the force of France,
         	Doing the execution and the act
         	For which we have in head assembled them?
         
         SCROOP	No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
         
         KING HENRY V	I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded
         	We carry not a heart with us from hence
         	That grows not in a fair consent with ours,
         	Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
         	Success and conquest to attend on us.
         
         CAMBRIDGE	Never was monarch better feared and loved
         	Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject
         	That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
         	Under the sweet shade of your government.
         
         GREY	True: those that were your father's enemies
         	Have steeped their galls in honey and do serve you
         	With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
         
         KING HENRY V	We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;
         	And shall forget the office of our hand,
         	Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
         	According to the weight and worthiness.
         
         SCROOP	So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
         	And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
         	To do your grace incessant services.
         
         KING HENRY V	We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
         	Enlarge the man committed yesterday,
         	That railed against our person: we consider
         	it was excess of wine that set him on;
         	And on his more advice we pardon him.
         
         SCROOP	That's mercy, but too much security:
         	Let him be punished, sovereign, lest example
         	Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
         
         KING HENRY V	O, let us yet be merciful.
         
         CAMBRIDGE	So may your highness, and yet punish too.
         
         GREY	Sir,
         	You show great mercy, if you give him life,
         	After the taste of much correction.
         
         KING HENRY V	Alas, your too much love and care of me
         	Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
         	If little faults, proceeding on distemper,
         	Shall not be winked at, how shall we stretch our eye
         	When capital crimes, chewed, swallowed and digested,
         	Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,
         	Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care
         	And tender preservation of our person,
         	Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:
         	Who are the late commissioners?
         
         CAMBRIDGE	I one, my lord:
         	Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.
         
         SCROOP	So did you me, my liege.
         
         GREY	And I, my royal sovereign.
         
         KING HENRY V	Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;
         	There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,
         	Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
         	Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.
         	My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,
         	We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!
         	What see you in those papers that you lose
         	So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
         	Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there
         	That hath so cowarded and chased your blood
         	Out of appearance?
         
         CAMBRIDGE	                  I do confess my fault;
         	And do submit me to your highness' mercy.

         SCROOP	|
         
         
         KING HENRY V	The mercy that was quick in us but late,
         	By your own counsel is suppressed and killed:
         	You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
         	For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
         	As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
         	See you, my princes, and my noble peers,
         	These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,
         	You know how apt our love was to accord
         	To furnish him with all appertinents
         	Belonging to his honour; and this man
         	Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,
         	And sworn unto the practises of France,
         	To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
         	This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
         	Than Cambridge is, hath wise sworn. But, O,
         	What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
         	Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!
         	Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
         	That knewest the very bottom of my soul,
         	That almost mightst have coined me into gold,
         	Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,
         	May it be possible, that foreign hire
         	Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
         	That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,
         	That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
         	As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
         	Treason and murder ever kept together,
         	As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
         	Working so grossly in a natural cause,
         	That admiration did not whoop at them:
         	But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
         	Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:
         	And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
         	That wrought upon thee so preposterously
         	Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:
         	All other devils that suggest by treasons
         	Do botch and bungle up damnation
         	With patches, colours, and with forms being fetched
         	From glistering semblances of piety;
         	But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up,
         	Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
         	Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
         	If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus
         	Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
         	He might return to vasty Tartar back,
         	And tell the legions 'I can never win
         	A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
         	O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected
         	The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
         	Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?
         	Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?
         	Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?
         	Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,
         	Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
         	Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
         	Garnished and decked in modest complement,
         	Not working with the eye without the ear,
         	And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
         	Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
         	And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
         	To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
         	With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
         	For this revolt of thine, methinks, is 
         	Another fall of man. Their faults are open:
         	Arrest them to the answer of the law;
         	And God acquit them of their practises!
         
         EXETER	   I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
         	Richard Earl of Cambridge.
         	I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
         	Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.
         	I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
         	Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.
         
         SCROOP	Our purposes God justly hath discovered;
         	And I repent my fault more than my death;
         	Which I beseech your highness to forgive,
         	Although my body pay the price of it.
         
         CAMBRIDGE	For me, the gold of France did not seduce;
         	Although I did admit it as a motive
         	The sooner to effect what I intended:
         	But God be thanked for prevention;
         	Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
         	Beseeching God and you to pardon me.
         
         GREY	Never did faithful subject more rejoice
         	At the discovery of most dangerous treason
         	Than I do at this hour joy over myself.
         	Prevented from a damned enterprise:
         	My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
         
         KING HENRY V	God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
         	You have conspired against our royal person,
         	Joined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffers
         	Received the golden earnest of our death;
         	Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
         	His princes and his peers to servitude,
         	His subjects to oppression and contempt
         	And his whole kingdom into desolation.
         	Touching our person seek we no revenge;
         	But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
         	Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
         	We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
         	Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
         	The taste whereof, God of his mercy give
         	You patience to endure, and true repentance
         	Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.
         
         	[Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded]
         
         	Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof
         	Shall be to you, as us,  glorious.
         	We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
         	Since God so graciously hath brought to light
         	This dangerous treason lurking in our way
         	To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now
         	But every rub is smoothed on our way.
         	Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver
         	Our puissance into the hand of God,
         	Putting it straight in expedition.
         	Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:

         	Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:
         	Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,
         	And we must yearn therefore.

         	heaven or in hell!
         
         Hostess	Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's
         	bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made
         	a finer end and went away an it had been any
         	christom child; a' parted even just between twelve
         	and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after
         	I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with
         	flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew
         	there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as
         	a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,
         	sir John!' quoth I	'what, man! be o' good
         	cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or
         	four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'
         	should not think of God; I hoped there was no need
         	to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So
         	a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my
         	hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as
         	cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and
         	they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and
         	upward, and all was as cold as any stone.
         
         NYM	They say he cried out of sack.
         
         Hostess	Ay, that a' did.
         
         BARDOLPH	And of women.
         
         Hostess	Nay, that a' did not.
         
         Boy	Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils
         	incarnate.
         
         Hostess	A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he
         	never d.
         
         Boy	A' said once, the devil would have him about women.
         
         Hostess	A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then
         	he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.
         
         Boy	Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon
         	Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul
         	burning in hell-fire?
         
         BARDOLPH	Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:
         	that's all the riches I got in his service.

         	Look to my chattels and my movables:
         	Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'
         	Trust none;
         	For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,
         	And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:
         	Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.
         	Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,
         	Let us to France;  horse-leeches, my boys,
         	To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!
         
         Boy	And that's but unwholesome food they say.

         KING OF FRANCE	Thus comes the English with full power upon us;
         	And more than carefully it us concerns
         	To answer royally in our defences.
         	Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,

         	It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
         	For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,

         	But that defences, musters, preparations,
         	Should be maintained, assembled and collected,
         	As were a war in expectation.
         	Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth
         	To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
         	And let us do it with no show of fear;
         	No, with no more than if we heard that England
         	Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
         	For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged,
         	Her sceptre so fantastically borne
         	By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
         	That fear attends her not.
         
         Constable	O peace, Prince Dauphin!
         	You are too much mistaken in this king:
         	Question your grace the late ambassadors,
         	With what great state he heard their embassy,
         	How well supplied with noble counsellors,
         	How modest in exception, and withal
         	How terrible in constant resolution,
         	And you shall find his vanities forespent
         	Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
         	Covering discretion with a coat of folly;
         	As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
         	That shall first spring and be most delicate.
         
         DAUPHIN	Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;
         	But though we think it so, it is no matter:
         	In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
         	The enemy more mighty than he seems:
         	So the proportions of defence are filled;
         	Which of a weak or niggardly projection
         	Doth,  a miser, spoil his coat with scanting
         	A little cloth.
         
         KING OF FRANCE	                  Think we King Harry strong;
         	And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
         	The kindred of him hath been fleshed upon us;
         	And he is bred out of that bloody strain
         	That haunted us in our familiar paths:
         	Witness our too much memorable shame
         	When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
         	And all our princes captived by the hand
         	Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
         	Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,
         	Up in the air, crowned with the golden sun,
         	Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,
         	Mangle the work of nature and deface
         	The patterns that by God and by French fathers
         	Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
         	Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
         	The native mightiness and fate of him.
         
         	[Enter a Messenger]

         	You see this chase is hotly followed, friends.

         	Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
         	Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
         	Take up the English short, and let them know
         	Of what a monarchy you are the head:
         	Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
         	As self-neglecting.
         
         	[Re-enter Lords, with EXETER and train]
         
         KING OF FRANCE	From our brother England?
         
         EXETER	From him; and thus he greets your majesty.
         	He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
         	That you divest yourself, and lay apart
         	The borrowed glories that by gift of heaven,
         	By law of nature and of nations, 'long
         	To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown
         	And all wide-stretched honours that pertain
         	By custom and the ordinance of times
         	Unto the crown of France. That you may know
         	'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
         	Picked from the worm-holes of long-vanished days,
         	Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
         	He sends you this most memorable line,
         	In every branch truly demonstrative;
         	Willing to overlook this pedigree:
         	And when you find him evenly derived
         	From his most famed of famous ancestors,
         	Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
         	Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
         	From him the native and true challenger.
         
         KING OF FRANCE	Or else what follows?
         
         EXETER	Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
         	Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
         	Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
         	In thunder and in earthquake,  a Jove,
         	That, if requiring fail, he will compel;
         	And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
         	Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
         	On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
         	Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
         	Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries
         	The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
         	For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,
         	That shall be swallowed in this controversy.
         	This is his claim, his threatening and my message;
         	Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
         	To whom expressly I bring greeting too.
         
         KING OF FRANCE	For us, we will consider of this further:
         	To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
         	Back to our brother England.
         
         DAUPHIN	For the Dauphin,
         	I stand here for him: what to him from England?
         
         EXETER	Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
         	And any thing that may not misbecome
         	The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
         	Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness
         	Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
         	Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
         	He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,
         	That caves and womby vaultages of France
         	Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
         	In second accent of his ordnance.
         
         DAUPHIN	Say, if my father render fair return,
         	It is against my will; for I desire
         	Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
         	As matching to his youth and vanity,
         	I did present him with the Paris balls.
         
         EXETER	He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
         	Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:
         	And, be assured, you'll find a difference,
         	As we his subjects have in wonder found,
         	Between the promise of his greener days
         	And these he masters now: now he weighs time
         	Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read
         	In your own losses, if he stay in France.
         
         KING OF FRANCE	To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.
         
         EXETER	Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king
         	Come here himself to question our delay;
         	For he is footed in this land already.
         
         KING OF FRANCE	You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:
         	A night is but small breath and little pause
         	To answer matters of this consequence.

         	Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
         	With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:

         	Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
         	Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
         	To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,
         	Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,
         	Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,
         	Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think
         	You stand upon the ravage and behold
         	A city on the inconstant billows dancing;
         	For so appears this fleet majestical,

         	Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
         	And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
         	Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,
         	Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;
         	For who is he, whose chin is but enriched
         	With one appearing hair, that will not follow
         	These culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
         	Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
         	Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
         	With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
         	Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;
         	Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
         	Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,
         	Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.

         	In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
         	As modest stillness and humility:
         	But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
         	Then imitate the action of the tiger;
         	Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
         	Disguise fair nature with hard-favoured rage;
         	Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
         	Let pry through the portage of the head
         	 the brass cannon; let the brow overwhelm it
         	As fearfully as doth a galled rock
         	Overhang and jutty his confounded base,
         	Swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.
         	Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
         	Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit

         Boy	As young as I am, I have observed these three
         	swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they
         	three, though they would serve me, could not be man
         	to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to
         	a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and
         	red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but
         	fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
         	and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks
         	words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath
         	heard that men of few words are the best men; and
         	therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'
         	should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
         	are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never
         	broke any man's head but his own, and that was
         	against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
         	any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
         	lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for
         	three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
         	brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
         	fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
         	men would carry coals. They would have me as
         	familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
         	handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,
         	if I should take from another's pocket to put into
         	mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I
         	must leave them, and seek some better service:
         	their villany goes against my weak stomach, and
         	therefore I must cast it up.

         MACMORRIS	It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: the
         	day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the
         	king, and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The
         	town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the
         	breach; and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing:
         	'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame to
         	stand still; it is shame, by my hand: and there is
         	throats to be cut, and works to be done; and there
         	ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!

         FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your
         	correction, there is not many of your nation--
         
         MACMORRIS	Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,
         	and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish
         	my nation? Who talks of my nation?
         
         FLUELLEN	Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is
         	meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think
         	you do not use me with that affability as in
         	discretion you ought to use me, look you: being as
         	good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of
         	war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in
         	other particularities.
         
         MACMORRIS	I do not know you so good a man as myself: so
         	Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.
         
         GOWER	Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.

         	opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so
         	bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war;
         	and there is an end.

         	[The Governor and some Citizens on the walls; the
         	English forces below. Enter KING HENRY and his train]
         
         KING HENRY V	How yet resolves the governor of the town?
         	This is the latest parle we will admit;
         	Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;
         	Or  to men proud of destruction
         	Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,
         	A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
         	If I begin the battery once again,
         	I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
         	Till in her ashes she lie buried.
         	The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
         	And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart,
         	In liberty of bloody hand shall range
         	With conscience wide as hell, mowing  grass
         	Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.
         	What is it then to me, if impious war,
         	Arrayed in flames  to the prince of fiends,
         	Do, with his smirched complexion, all fell feats
         	Enlinked to waste and desolation?
         	What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,
         	If your pure maidens fall into the hand
         	Of hot and forcing violation?
         	What rein can hold licentious wickedness
         	When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
         	We may as bootless spend our vain command
         	Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
         	As send precepts to the leviathan
         	To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
         	Take pity of your town and of your people,
         	Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;
         	Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
         	Overblows the filthy and contagious clouds
         	Of heady murder, spoil and villany.
         	If not, why, in a moment look to see
         	The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
         	Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;
         	Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
         	And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls,
         	Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
         	Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
         	Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
         	At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
         	What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,
         	Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroyed?
         
         GOVERNOR	Our expectation hath this day an end:
         	The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,
         	Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
         	To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,
         	We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
         	Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;
         	For we no longer are defensible.
         
         KING HENRY V	Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,
         	Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,
         	And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:
         	Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,
         	The winter coming on and sickness growing
         	Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
         	To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest;
         	To-morrow for the march are we addrest.

         Constable	And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
         	Let us not live in France; let us quit all
         	And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
         
         DAUPHIN	O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,
         	The emptying of our fathers' luxury,
         	Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
         	Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,
         	And overlook their grafters?
         
         BOURBON	Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!
         	Mort de ma vie! if they march along
         	Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,
         	To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm
         	In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.
         
         Constable	Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?
         	Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,
         	On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
         	Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
         	A drench for sur-reined jades, their barley-broth,
         	Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
         	And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
         	Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,
         	Let us not hang  roping icicles
         	Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people
         	Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!
         	Poor we may call them in their native lords.
         
         DAUPHIN	By faith and honour,
         	Our madams mock at us, and plainly say
         	Our mettle is bred out and they will give
         	Their bodies to the lust of English youth
         	To new-store France with bastard warriors.
         
         BOURBON	They bid us to the English dancing-schools,
         	And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;
         	Saying our grace is only in our heels,
         	And that we are most lofty runaways.
         
         KING OF FRANCE	Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:
         	Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.

         	More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:

         	You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,
         	Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;

         	Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconberg,
         	Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;
         	High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,
         	For your great seats now quit you of great shames.
         	Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
         	With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:
         	Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
         	Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
         	The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:
         	Go down upon him, you have power enough,
         	And in a captive chariot into Rouen
         	Bring him our prisoner.
         
         Constable	This becomes the great.
         	Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
         	His soldiers sick and famished in their march,
         	For I am sure, when he shall see our army,
         	He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
         	And for achievement offer us his ransom.
         
         KING OF FRANCE	Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy.
         	And let him say to England that we send
         	To know what willing ransom he will give.
         	Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.

         GOWER	Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
         
         FLUELLEN	The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;
         	and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my
         	heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and
         	my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and
         	blessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps the
         	bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.
         	There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
         	pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as
         	valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no
         	estimation in the world; but did see him do as
         	gallant service.

         PISTOL	Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,
         	And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,
         	And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,
         	That goddess blind,
         	That stands upon the rolling restless stone--
         
         FLUELLEN	By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is
         	painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to
         	signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is
         	painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which
         	is the moral of it, that she is turning, and
         	inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her
         	foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,
         	which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,
         	the poet makes a most excellent description of it:
         	Fortune is an excellent moral.
         
         PISTOL	Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;
         	For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:
         	A damned death!
         	Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free
         	And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:
         	But Exeter hath given the doom of death
         	For pax of little price.
         	Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:
         	And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
         	With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:
         	Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
         
         FLUELLEN	Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
         
         PISTOL	Why then, rejoice therefore.
         
         FLUELLEN	Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice
         	at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would
         	desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put
         	him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.
         
         PISTOL	Die and be damned! and figo for thy friendship!
         
         FLUELLEN	It is well.
         
         PISTOL	The fig of Spain!

         FLUELLEN	Very good.
         
         GOWER	Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I
         	remember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.
         
         FLUELLEN	I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the
         	bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it
         	is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,
         	I warrant you, when time is serve.
         
         GOWER	Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then
         	goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return
         	into London under the form of a soldier. And such
         	fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:
         	and they will learn you by rote where services were
         	done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,
         	at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was
         	shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;
         	and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,
         	which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what
         	a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of
         	the camp will do among foaming bottles and
         	ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But
         	you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or
         	else you may be marvellously mistook.
         
         FLUELLEN	I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is
         	not the man that he would gladly make show to the
         	world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will
         	tell him my mind.
         
         	[Drum heard]
         
         	Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with
         	him from the pridge.
         
         	[Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers]
         
         	God pless your majesty!
         
         KING HENRY V	How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?
         
         FLUELLEN	Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has
         	very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is
         	gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most
         	prave passages; marry, th' athversary was have
         	possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to
         	retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the
         	pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a
         	prave man.
         
         KING HENRY V	What men have you lost, Fluellen?
         
         FLUELLEN	The perdition of th' athversary hath been very
         	great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I
         	think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that
         	is  to be executed for robbing a church, one
         	Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is
         	all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'
         	fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is 
         	a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;
         	but his nose is executed and his fire's out.
         
         KING HENRY V	We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we
         	give express charge, that in our marches through the
         	country, there be nothing compelled from the
         	villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the
         	French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;
         	for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the
         	gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
         
         	[Tucket. Enter MONTJOY]
         
         MONTJOY	You know me by my habit.
         
         KING HENRY V	Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?
         
         MONTJOY	My master's mind.
         
         KING HENRY V	Unfold it.
         
         MONTJOY	Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:
         	Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage
         	is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we
         	could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we
         	thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
         	full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice
         	is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see
         	his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him
         	therefore consider of his ransom; which must
         	proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we
         	have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in
         	weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.
         	For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the
         	effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too
         	faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own
         	person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and
         	worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and
         	tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his
         	followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far
         	my king and master; so much my office.
         
         KING HENRY V	What is thy name? I know thy quality.
         
         MONTJOY	Montjoy.
         
         KING HENRY V	Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.
         	And tell thy king I do not seek him now;
         	But could be willing to march on to Calais
         	Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,
         	Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
         	Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,
         	My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
         	My numbers lessened, and those few I have
         	Almost no better than so many French;
         	Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
         	I thought upon one pair of English legs
         	Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
         	That I do brag thus! This your air of France
         	Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.
         	Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
         	My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
         	My army but a weak and sickly guard;
         	Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
         	Though France himself and such another neighbour
         	Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.
         	Go bid thy master well advise himself:
         	If we may pass, we will; if we be hindered,
         	We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
         	Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
         	The sum of all our answer is but this:
         	We would not seek a battle, as we are;
         	Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:
         	So tell your master.
         
         MONTJOY	I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         GLOUCESTER	I hope they will not come upon us now.
         
         KING HENRY V	We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.
         	March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:
         	Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,
         	And on to-morrow, bid them march away.

         ACT I
         
         
         
         SCENE V	The French camp, near Agincourt:
         
         
         	[Enter the Constable of France, the LORD RAMBURES,
         	ORLEANS, DAUPHIN, with others]
         
         Constable	Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!
         
         ORLEANS	You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.
         
         Constable	It is the best horse of Europe.
         
         ORLEANS	Will it never be morning?
         
         DAUPHIN	My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you
         	talk of horse and armour?
         
         ORLEANS	You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
         
         DAUPHIN	What a long night is this! I will not change my
         	horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
         	Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
         	entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,
         	chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I
         	soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth
         	sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his
         	hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.
         
         ORLEANS	He's of the colour of the nutmeg.
         
         DAUPHIN	And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for
         	Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull
         	elements of earth and water never appear in him, but
         	only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts
         	him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you
         	may call beasts.
         
         Constable	Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.
         
         DAUPHIN	It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is  the
         	bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.
         
         ORLEANS	No more, cousin.
         
         DAUPHIN	Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the
         	rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary
         	deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as
         	fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent
         	tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:
         	'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for
         	a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the
         	world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
         	their particular functions and wonder at him. I
         	once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:
         	'Wonder of nature,'--
         
         ORLEANS	I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
         
         DAUPHIN	Then did they imitate that which I composed to my
         	courser, for my horse is my mistress.
         
         ORLEANS	Your mistress bears well.
         
         DAUPHIN	Me well; which is the prescript praise and
         	perfection of a good and particular mistress.
         
         Constable	Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
         	shook your back.
         
         DAUPHIN	So perhaps did yours.
         
         Constable	Mine was not bridled.
         
         DAUPHIN	O then be she was old and gentle; and you rode,
         	 a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in
         	your straight strossers.
         
         Constable	You have good judgment in horsemanship.
         
         DAUPHIN	Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride
         	not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have
         	my horse to my mistress.
         
         Constable	I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
         
         DAUPHIN	I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.
         
         Constable	I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow
         	to my mistress.
         
         DAUPHIN	'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et
         	la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.
         
         Constable	Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any
         	such proverb so little kin to the purpose.
         
         RAMBURES	My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tent
         	to-night, are those stars or suns upon it?
         
         Constable	Stars, my lord.
         
         DAUPHIN	Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.
         
         Constable	And yet my sky shall not want.
         
         DAUPHIN	That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and
         	'twere more honour some were away.
         
         Constable	Even as your horse bears your praises; who would
         	trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.
         
         DAUPHIN	Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will
         	it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and
         	my way shall be paved with English faces.
         
         Constable	I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of
         	my way: but I would it were morning; for I would
         	fain be about the ears of the English.
         
         RAMBURES	Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?
         
         Constable	You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.
         
         DAUPHIN	'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         ORLEANS	The Dauphin longs for morning.
         
         RAMBURES	He longs to eat the English.
         
         Constable	I think he will eat all he kills.
         
         ORLEANS	By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.
         
         Constable	Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.
         
         ORLEANS	He is simply the most active gentleman of France.
         
         Constable	Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.
         
         ORLEANS	He never did harm, that I heard of.
         
         Constable	Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.
         
         ORLEANS	I know him to be valiant.
         
         Constable	I was told that by one that knows him better than
         	you.
         
         ORLEANS	What's he?
         
         Constable	Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared
         	not who knew it
         
         ORLEANS	He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.
         
         Constable	By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it
         	but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it
         	appears, it will bate.
         
         ORLEANS	Ill will never said well.
         
         Constable	I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'
         
         ORLEANS	And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'
         
         Constable	Well placed: there stands your friend for the
         	devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A
         	pox of the devil.'
         
         ORLEANS	You are the better at proverbs, by how much 'A
         	fool's bolt is soon shot.'
         
         Constable	You have shot over.
         
         ORLEANS	'Tis not the first time you were overshot.
         
         	[Enter a Messenger]
         
         Messenger	My lord high constable, the English lie within
         	fifteen hundred paces of your tents.
         
         Constable	Who hath measured the ground?
         
         Messenger	The Lord Grandpre.
         
         Constable	A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were
         	day! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for
         	the dawning as we do.
         
         ORLEANS	What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
         	England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so
         	far out of his knowledge!
         
         Constable	If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
         
         ORLEANS	That they lack; for if their heads had any
         	intellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy
         	head-pieces.
         
         RAMBURES	That island of England breeds very valiant
         	creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.
         
         ORLEANS	Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a
         	Russian bear and have their heads crushed 
         	rotten apples! You may as well say, that's a
         	valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.
         
         Constable	Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the
         	mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving
         	their wits with their wives: and then give them
         	great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will
         	eat  wolves and fight  devils.
         
         ORLEANS	Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.
         
         Constable	Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs
         	to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:
         	come, shall we about it?
         
         ORLEANS	It is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by ten
         	We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
         
         	[Exeunt]

         	PROLOGUE.
         
         
         	[Enter Chorus]
         
         Chorus	Now entertain conjecture of a time
         	When creeping murmur and the poring dark
         	Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
         	From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
         	The hum of either army stilly sounds,
         	That the fixed sentinels almost receive
         	The secret whispers of each other's watch:
         	Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
         	Each battle sees the other's umbered face;
         	Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
         	Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
         	The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
         	With busy hammers closing rivets up,
         	Give dreadful note of preparation:
         	The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
         	And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
         	Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
         	The confident and over-lusty French
         	Do the low-rated English play at dice;
         	And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
         	Who,  a foul and ugly witch, doth limp
         	So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
         	 sacrifices, by their watchful fires
         	Sit patiently and inly ruminate
         	The morning's danger, and their gesture sad
         	Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats
         	Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
         	So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
         	The royal captain of this ruined band
         	Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
         	Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
         	For forth he goes and visits all his host.
         	Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
         	And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.
         	Upon his royal face there is no note
         	How dread an army hath enrounded him;
         	Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
         	Unto the weary and all-watched night,
         	But freshly looks and over-bears attaint
         	With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
         	That every wretch, pining and pale before,
         	Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:
         	A largess universal  the sun
         	His liberal eye doth give to every one,
         	Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,
         	Behold, as may unworthiness define,
         	A little touch of Harry in the night.
         	And so our scene must to the battle fly;
         	Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace
         	With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
         	Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,
         	The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
         	Minding true things by what their mockeries be.

         	[Enter KING HENRY, BEDFORD, and GLOUCESTER]
         
         KING HENRY V	Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;
         	The greater therefore should our courage be.
         	Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!
         	There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
         	Would men observingly distil it out.
         	For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,
         	Which is both healthful and good husbandry:
         	Besides, they are our outward consciences,
         	And preachers to us all, admonishing
         	That we should dress us fairly for our end.
         	Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
         	And make a moral of the devil himself.
         
         	[Enter ERPINGHAM]
         
         	Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
         	A good soft pillow for that good white head
         	Were better than a churlish turf of France.
         
         ERPINGHAM	Not so, my liege: this lodging s me better,
         	Since I may say 'Now lie I  a king.'
         
         KING HENRY V	'Tis good for men to love their present pains
         	Upon example; so the spirit is eased:
         	And when the mind is quickened, out of doubt,
         	The organs, though defunct and dead before,
         	Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,
         	With casted slough and fresh legerity.
         	Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
         	Commend me to the princes in our camp;
         	Do my good morrow to them, and anon
         	Desire them an to my pavilion.
         
         GLOUCESTER	We shall, my liege.
         
         ERPINGHAM	Shall I attend your grace?
         
         KING HENRY V	No, my good knight;
         	Go with my brothers to my lords of England:
         	I and my bosom must debate awhile,
         	And then I would no other company.
         
         ERPINGHAM	The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!

         PISTOL	Qui va la?
         
         KING HENRY V	A friend.
         
         PISTOL	Discuss unto me; art thou officer?
         	Or art thou base, common and popular?
         
         KING HENRY V	I am a gentleman of a company.
         
         PISTOL	Trailest thou the puissant pike?
         
         KING HENRY V	Even so. What are you?
         
         PISTOL	As good a gentleman as the emperor.
         
         KING HENRY V	Then you are a better than the king.
         
         PISTOL	The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,
         	A lad of life, an imp of fame;
         	Of parents good, of fist most valiant.
         	I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string
         	I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?
         
         KING HENRY V	Harry le Roy.
         
         PISTOL	Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?
         
         KING HENRY V	No, I am a Welshman.
         
         PISTOL	Knowest thou Fluellen?
         
         KING HENRY V	Yes.
         
         PISTOL	Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate
         	Upon Saint Davy's day.
         
         KING HENRY V	Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,
         	lest he knock that about yours.
         
         PISTOL	Art thou his friend?
         
         KING HENRY V	And his kinsman too.
         
         PISTOL	The figo for thee, then!
         
         KING HENRY V	I thank you: God be with you!
         
         PISTOL	My name is Pistol called.
         
         	[Exit]
         
         KING HENRY V	It sorts well with your fierceness.
         
         	[Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER]
         
         GOWER	Captain Fluellen!
         
         FLUELLEN	So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It is
         	the greatest admiration of the universal world, when
         	the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
         	wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to
         	examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall
         	find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle
         	nor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,
         	you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the
         	cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety
         	of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.
         
         GOWER	Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.
         
         FLUELLEN	If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
         	coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,
         	look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating
         	coxcomb? in your own conscience, now?
         
         GOWER	I will speak lower.
         
         FLUELLEN	I pray you and beseech you that you will.
         
         	[Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN]
         
         KING HENRY V	Though it appear a little out of fashion,
         	There is much care and valour in this Welshman.
         
         	[Enter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT,
         	and MICHAEL WILLIAMS]
         
         COURT	Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which
         	breaks yonder?
         
         BATES	I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire
         	the approach of day.
         
         WILLIAMS	We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think
         	we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?
         
         KING HENRY V	A friend.
         
         WILLIAMS	Under what captain serve you?
         
         KING HENRY V	Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
         
         WILLIAMS	A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I
         	pray you, what thinks he of our estate?
         
         KING HENRY V	Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be
         	washed off the next tide.
         
         BATES	He hath not told his thought to the king?
         
         KING HENRY V	No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I
         	speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I
         	am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the
         	element shows to him as it doth to me; all his
         	senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies
         	laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and
         	though his affections are higher mounted than ours,
         	yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the 
         	wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we
         	do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish
         	as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess
         	him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing
         	it, should dishearten his army.
         
         BATES	He may show what outward courage he will; but I
         	believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish
         	himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he
         	were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.
         
         KING HENRY V	By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:
         	I think he would not wish himself any where but
         	where he is.
         
         BATES	Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
         	sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.
         
         KING HENRY V	I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here
         	alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's
         	minds: methinks I could not die any where so
         	contented as in the king's company; his cause being
         	just and his quarrel honourable.
         
         WILLIAMS	That's more than we know.
         
         BATES	Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know
         	enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if
         	his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes
         	the crime of it out of us.
         
         WILLIAMS	But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath
         	a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and
         	arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join
         	together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at
         	such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a
         	surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind
         	them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their
         	children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die
         	well that die in a battle; for how can they
         	charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their
         	argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it
         	will be a black matter for the king that led them to
         	it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of
         	subjection.
         
         KING HENRY V	So, if a son that is by his father sent about
         	merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the
         	imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be
         	imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a
         	servant, under his master's command transporting a
         	sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in
         	many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the
         	business of the master the author of the servant's
         	damnation: but this is not so: the king is not
         	bound to answer the particular endings of his
         	soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of
         	his servant; for they purpose not their death, when
         	they purpose their services. Besides, there is no
         	king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to
         	the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all
         	unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them
         	the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;
         	some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
         	perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that
         	have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
         	pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have
         	defeated the law and outrun native punishment,
         	though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to
         	fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;
         	so that here men are punished for before-breach of
         	the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where
         	they feared the death, they have borne life away;
         	and where they would be safe, they perish: then if
         	they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of
         	their damnation than he was before guilty of those
         	impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
         	subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's
         	soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
         	the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every
         	mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death
         	is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was
         	blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:
         	and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think
         	that, making God so free an offer, He let him
         	outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
         	others how they should prepare.
         
         WILLIAMS	'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon
         	his own head, the king is not to answer it.
         
         BATES	But I do not desire he should answer for me; and
         	yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
         
         KING HENRY V	I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
         
         WILLIAMS	Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but
         	when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we
         	never the wiser.
         
         KING HENRY V	If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.
         
         WILLIAMS	You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an
         	elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can
         	do against a monarch! you may as well go about to
         	turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
         	peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
         	after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.
         
         KING HENRY V	Your reproof is something too round: I should be
         	angry with you, if the time were convenient.
         
         WILLIAMS	Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
         
         KING HENRY V	I embrace it.
         
         WILLIAMS	How shall I know thee again?
         
         KING HENRY V	Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my
         	bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I
         	will make it my quarrel.
         
         WILLIAMS	Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
         
         KING HENRY V	There.
         
         WILLIAMS	This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come
         	to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'
         	by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.
         
         KING HENRY V	If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.
         
         WILLIAMS	Thou darest as well be hanged.
         
         KING HENRY V	Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the
         	king's company.
         
         WILLIAMS	Keep thy word: fare thee well.
         
         BATES	Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have
         	French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.
         
         KING HENRY V	Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to
         	one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their
         	shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut
         	French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will
         	be a clipper.
         
         	[Exeunt soldiers]
         
         	Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,
         	Our debts, our careful wives,
         	Our children and our sins lay on the king!
         	We must bear all. O hard condition,
         	Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
         	Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel
         	But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease
         	Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!
         	And what have kings, that privates have not too,
         	Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
         	And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?
         	What kind of god art thou, that sufferest more
         	Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
         	What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?
         	O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
         	What is thy soul of adoration?
         	Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,
         	Creating awe and fear in other men?
         	Wherein thou art less happy being feared
         	Than they in fearing.
         	What drinkest thou oft, instead of homage sweet,
         	But poisoned flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,
         	And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
         	Thinkest thou the fiery fever will go out
         	With titles blown from adulation?
         	Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
         	Canst thou, when thou commandest the beggar's knee,
         	Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
         	That playest so subtly with a king's repose;
         	I am a king that find thee, and I know
         	'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,
         	The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
         	The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
         	The farced title running 'fore the king,

         	That beats upon the high shore of this world,
         	No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
         	Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
         	Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
         	Who with a body filled and vacant mind
         	Gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread;
         	Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
         	But,  a lackey, from the rise to set
         	Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night
         	Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,
         	Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,
         	And follows so the ever-running year,
         	With profitable labour, to his grave:
         	And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
         	Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
         	Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.

         	Possess them not with fear; take from them now
         	The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers
         	Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,
         	O, not to-day, think not upon the fault
         	My father made in compassing the crown!
         	I Richard's body have interred anew;
         	And on it have bestowed more contrite tears
         	Than from it issued forced drops of blood:
         	Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,
         	Who twice a-day their withered hands hold up
         	Toward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have built
         	Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
         	Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;
         	Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
         	Since that my penitence comes after all,
         	Imploring pardon.

         	Do but behold yon poor and starved band,
         	And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
         	Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
         	There is not work enough for all our hands;
         	Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
         	To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,
         	That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,
         	And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,
         	The vapour of our valour will overturn them.
         	'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
         	That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
         	Who in unnecessary action swarm
         	About our squares of battle, were enow
         	To purge this field of such a hilding foe,
         	Though we upon this mountain's basis by
         	Took stand for idle speculation:
         	But that our honours must not. What's to say?
         	A very little little let us do.
         	And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
         	The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
         	For our approach shall so much dare the field
         	That England shall couch down in fear and yield.

         	Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,
         	And our air shakes them passing scornfully:
         	Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host
         	And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:
         	The horsemen sit  fixed candlesticks,
         	With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades
         	Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
         	The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes
         	And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
         	Lies foul with chewed grass, still and motionless;
         	And their executors, the knavish crows,
         	Fly over them, all impatient for their hour.
         	Description cannot suit itself in words
         	To demonstrate the life of such a battle
         	In life so lifeless as it shows itself.

         KING HENRY V	What's he that wishes so?
         	My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:
         	If we are marked to die, we are enow
         	To do our country loss; and if to live,
         	The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
         	God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
         	By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
         	Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
         	It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
         	Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
         	But if it be a sin to covet honour,
         	I am the most offending soul alive.
         	No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:
         	God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
         	As one man more, methinks, would share from me
         	For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
         	Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
         	That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
         	Let him depart; his passport shall be made
         	And crowns for convoy put into his purse:

         	That fears his fellowship to die with us.

         	Shall be my brother; be he never so vile,
         	This day shall gentle his condition:
         	And gentlemen in England now a-bed
         	Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
         	And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks

         KING HENRY V	I pray thee, bear my former answer back:
         	Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
         	Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
         	The man that once did sell the lion's skin
         	While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.
         	A many of our bodies shall no doubt
         	Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,
         	Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:
         	And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
         	Dying  men, though buried in your dunghills,
         	They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,
         	And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;
         	Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
         	The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
         	Mark then abounding valour in our English,
         	That being dead,  to the bullet's grazing,
         	Break out into a second course of mischief,
         	Killing in relapse of mortality.
         	Let me speak proudly: tell the constable
         	We are but warriors for the working-day;
         	Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched
         	With rainy marching in the painful field;
         	There's not a piece of feather in our host--
         	Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--
         	And time hath worn us into slovenry:
         	But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;
         	And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
         	They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
         	The gay new coats over the French soldiers' heads
         	And turn them out of service. If they do this,--
         	As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then
         	Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;
         	Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:
         	They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
         	Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,
         	Shall yield them little, tell the constable.
         
         MONTJOY	I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
